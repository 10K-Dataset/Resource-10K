Note
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations, may contain or incorporate
    by reference information that includes or is based upon
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements give expectations or forecasts of future events.
    These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not
    relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words
    such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms
    of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
    operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
    statements relating to future actions, prospective services or
    products, future performance or results of current and
    anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the
    outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in
    operations and financial results.

Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.
    They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining the actual future results of MetLife,
    Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. These statements are
    based on current expectations and the current economic
    environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties
    that are difficult to predict. These statements are not
    guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ
    materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other
    factors that might cause such differences include the risks,
    uncertainties and other factors identified in MetLife,
    Inc.’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”). These factors include:
    (1) difficult conditions in the global capital markets;
    (2) increased volatility and disruption of the capital and
    credit markets, which may affect our ability to seek financing
    or access our credit facilities; (3) uncertainty about the
    effectiveness of the U.S. government’s programs to
    stabilize the financial system, the imposition of fees relating
    thereto, or the promulgation of additional regulations;
    (4) impact of comprehensive financial services regulation
    reform on us; (5) exposure to financial and capital market
    risk; (6) changes in general economic conditions, including
    the performance of financial markets and interest rates, which
    may affect our ability to raise capital, generate fee income and
    market-related revenue and finance statutory reserve
    requirements and may require us to pledge collateral or make
    payments related to declines in value of specified assets;
    (7) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from our
    participation in a securities lending program and other
    transactions; (8) investment losses and defaults, and
    changes to investment valuations; (9) impairments of
    goodwill and realized losses or market value impairments to
    illiquid assets; (10) defaults on our mortgage loans;
    (11) the impairment of other financial institutions that
    could adversely affect our investments or business;
    (12) our ability to address unforeseen liabilities, asset
    impairments, loss of key contractual relationships, or rating
    actions arising from acquisitions or dispositions, including our
    acquisition of American Life Insurance Company (“American
    Life”), a subsidiary of ALICO Holdings LLC (“ALICO
    Holdings”), and Delaware American Life Insurance Company
    (“DelAm,” together with American Life, collectively,
    “ALICO”) (the “Acquisition”) and to
    successfully integrate and manage the growth of acquired
    businesses with minimal disruption; (13) uncertainty with
    respect to the outcome of the closing agreement entered into
    between American Life and the United States Internal Revenue
    Service in connection with the Acquisition;
    (14) uncertainty with respect to any incremental tax
    benefits resulting from the planned elections for ALICO and
    certain of its subsidiaries under Section 338 of the
    U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Section 338 Elections”); (15) the dilutive
    impact on our stockholders resulting from the issuance of equity
    securities to ALICO Holdings in connection with the Acquisition;
    (16) downward pressure on our stock price as a result of
    ALICO Holdings’ ability to sell its equity securities;
    (17) the conditional payment obligation of approximately
    $300 million to ALICO Holdings if the conversion of the
    preferred stock issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the
    Acquisition into our common stock is not approved;
    (18) economic, political, currency and other risks relating
    to our international operations, including with respect to
    fluctuations of exchange rates; (19) our primary reliance,
    as a holding company, on dividends from our subsidiaries to meet
    debt payment obligations and the applicable regulatory
    restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such
    dividends; (20) downgrades in our claims paying ability,
    financial strength or credit ratings; (21) ineffectiveness
    of risk management policies and procedures;
    (22) availability and effectiveness of reinsurance or
    indemnification arrangements, as well as default or failure of
    counterparties to perform; (23) discrepancies between
    actual



claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices for our
    products and establishing the liabilities for our obligations
    for future policy benefits and claims; (24) catastrophe
    losses; (25) heightened competition, including with respect
    to pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of
    distributors, the development of new products by new and
    existing competitors, distribution of amounts available under
    U.S. government programs, and for personnel;
    (26) unanticipated changes in industry trends;
    (27) changes in accounting standards, practices

and/or

policies; (28) changes in assumptions related to deferred
    policy acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, value of
    business acquired or goodwill; (29) increased expenses
    relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as
    health care and other employee benefits; (30) exposure to
    losses related to variable annuity guarantee benefits, including
    from significant and sustained downturns or extreme volatility
    in equity markets, reduced interest rates, unanticipated
    policyholder behavior, mortality or longevity, and the
    adjustment for nonperformance risk; (31) deterioration in
    the experience of the “closed block” established in
    connection with the reorganization of Metropolitan Life
    Insurance Company (“MLIC”); (32) adverse results
    or other consequences from litigation, arbitration or regulatory
    investigations; (33) inability to protect our intellectual
    property rights or claims of infringement of the intellectual
    property rights of others, (34) discrepancies between
    actual experience and assumptions used in establishing
    liabilities related to other contingencies or obligations;
    (35) regulatory, legislative or tax changes relating to our
    insurance, banking, international, or other operations that may
    affect the cost of, or demand for, our products or services,
    impair our ability to attract and retain talented and
    experienced management and other employees, or increase the cost
    or administrative burdens of providing benefits to employees;
    (36) the effects of business disruption or economic
    contraction due to terrorism, other hostilities, or natural
    catastrophes, including any related impact on our disaster
    recovery systems and management continuity planning which could
    impair our ability to conduct business effectively;
    (37) the effectiveness of our programs and practices in
    avoiding giving our associates incentives to take excessive
    risks; and (38) other risks and uncertainties described
    from time to time in MetLife, Inc.’s filings with the SEC.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update
    any forward-looking statement if we later become aware that such
    statement is not likely to be achieved. Please consult any
    further disclosures MetLife, Inc. makes on related subjects in
    reports to the SEC.

    representations and warranties by each of the parties to the
    applicable agreement. These representations and warranties have

    party in connection with the negotiation of the applicable
    agreement, which disclosures are not necessarily reflected in
    the agreement;

may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different
    from what may be viewed as material to investors; and

Part I

Item 1.

Business

As used in this

Form 10-K,

“MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,”
    “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), its subsidiaries and affiliates.

With a more than

140-year

history, we have grown to become a leading global provider of
    insurance, annuities and employee benefit programs, serving
    90 million customers in over 60 countries. Through our
    subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife holds leading market
    positions in the United States (“U.S.”), Japan, Latin
    America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Over the past
    several years, we have grown our core businesses, as well as
    successfully executed on our growth strategy. This has included
    completing a number of transactions that have resulted in the
    acquisition and, in some cases, divestiture of certain
    businesses while also further strengthening our balance sheet to
    position MetLife for continued growth.

On November 1, 2010 (the “Acquisition Date”),
    MetLife, Inc. completed the acquisition of American Life
    Insurance Company (“American Life”), from ALICO
    Holdings LLC (“ALICO Holdings”), a subsidiary of
    American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”), and
    Delaware American Life Insurance Company (“DelAm,”)
    from AIG, (American Life, together with DelAm, collectively,
    “ALICO”) (the “Acquisition”) for a total
    purchase price of $16.4 billion. The business acquired in
    the Acquisition provides consumers and businesses with products
    and services, life insurance, accident and health insurance,
    retirement and wealth management solutions. This transaction
    delivers on our global growth strategies, adding significant
    scale and reach to MetLife’s international footprint,
    furthering our diversification in geographic mix and product
    offerings, as well as increasing our distribution strength. See
    Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

MetLife is organized into five segments: Insurance Products,
    Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and
    Auto & Home (collectively,
    “U.S. Business”) and International. The assets
    and liabilities of ALICO as of November 30, 2010 and the
    operating results of ALICO from the Acquisition Date through
    November 30, 2010 are included in the International
    segment. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results
    of operations in Banking, Corporate & Other, which
    includes MetLife Bank, National Association (“MetLife
    Bank”) and other business activities. For reporting periods
    beginning in 2011, our

non-U.S. Business

results will be presented within two separate segments: Japan
    and Other International Regions. MetLife’s management
    continues to evaluate the Company’s segment performance and
    allocated resources and may adjust such measurements in the
    future to better reflect segment profitability.

U.S. Business provides a variety of insurance and financial
    services products — including life, dental,
    disability, auto and homeowner insurance, guaranteed interest
    and stable value products, and annuities — through
    both proprietary and independent retail distribution channels,
    as well as at the workplace. This business serves over 60,000
    group customers, including over 90 of the top one hundred
    FORTUNE

®

companies, and provides protection and retirement solutions to
    millions of individuals.

International operates in Japan and 64 countries within Latin
    America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. MetLife is
    the largest life insurer in Mexico and also holds leading market
    positions in Japan, Poland, Chile and South Korea. This business
    provides life insurance, accident and health insurance, credit
    insurance, annuities, endowment and retirement &
    savings products to both individuals and groups. International
    is the fastest-growing of MetLife’s businesses, and we
    believe it will be one of the largest future growth areas.

Within the U.S., we also provide a variety of mortgage and
    deposit products through MetLife Bank. Results of our banking
    operation are reported in Banking, Corporate & Other.

Operating revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10%
    of consolidated operating revenues in any of the last three
    years. Financial information, including revenues, expenses,
    operating earnings, and total assets by segment, is provided in
    Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Operating revenues and operating earnings are
    performance measures that are not based on accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America
    (“GAAP”). See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    for definitions of such measures.



We are one of the largest institutional investors in the
    U.S. with a $476 billion general account portfolio
    invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds,
    structured finance securities, commercial and agricultural
    mortgage loans, U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed securities, as well as real estate and corporate
    equity. Over the past several years, we have taken a number of
    actions to further diversify and strengthen our general account
    portfolio.

Our well-recognized brand, leading market positions, competitive
    and innovative product offerings and financial strength and
    expertise should help drive future growth and enhance
    shareholder value, building on a long history of fairness,
    honesty and integrity. Over the course of the next several
    years, we will pursue the following objectives to achieve our
    goals:

•

    our businesses

Overview

Insurance
    Products

Our Insurance Products segment offers a broad range of
    protection products and services aimed at serving the financial
    needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products
    are sold to individuals and corporations, as well as other
    institutions and their respective employees. We have built a
    leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through
    long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate
    employers in the U.S., and are one of the largest issuers of
    individual life insurance products in the U.S. We are
    organized into three businesses: Group Life, Individual Life and
    Non-Medical Health.

Our Group Life insurance products and services include variable
    life, universal life, and term life products. We offer group
    insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary
    benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the
    employee. These group products and services also include
    employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard
    products or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs.

Our Individual Life insurance products and services include
    variable life, universal life, term life and whole life
    products. Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we
    offer a full range of mutual funds and other securities
    products. The elimination of transactions from activity between
    the segments within U.S. Business occurs within Individual
    Life.



The major products within both Group Life and Individual Life
    are as follows:

Variable Life.

Variable life products provide
    insurance coverage through a contract that gives the
    policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on
    the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with
    certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life
    products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the
    policyholder into a variety of separate account investment
    options or directed to the Company’s general account. In
    the separate account investment options, the policyholder bears
    the entire risk of the investment results. We collect specified
    fees for the management of the investment options. The
    policyholder’s cash value reflects the investment return of
    the selected investment options, net of management fees and
    insurance-related and other charges. In some instances,
    third-party money management firms manage these investment
    options. With some products, by maintaining a certain premium
    level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Universal Life.

Universal life products
    provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life,
    except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances,
    are allocated only to the Company’s general account.
    Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or
    decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of
    the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of
    premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained
    for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified
    expenses. Interest is credited to the policyholder’s
    account at interest rates we determine, subject to specified
    minimums. Specific charges are made against the
    policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection
    and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain
    premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Term Life.

Term life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified
    time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums.
    Specified coverage periods range from one year to 30 years,
    but in no event are they longer than the period over which
    premiums are paid. Death benefits may be level over the period
    or decreasing. Decreasing coverage is used principally to
    provide for loan repayment in the event of death. Premiums may
    be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may
    be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are
    sometimes referred to as pure protection products, in that there
    are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts
    expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the
    insured party is still living.

Whole Life.

Whole life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for
    the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined
    period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of
    the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be
    level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
    Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a
    participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders
    may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death
    benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or
    reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.
    Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder,
    this group of products provides significant flexibility to
    individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs
    and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed
    benefits.

Our Non-Medical Health products and services include dental
    insurance, group short- and long-term disability, individual
    disability income, long-term care (“LTC”), critical
    illness and accidental death & dismemberment
    coverages. Other products and services include
    employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance provided
    through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid legal
    plans. We also sell administrative services-only
    (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. The major
    products in this area are:

Dental.

Dental products provide insurance and
    ASO plans that assist employees, retirees and their families in
    maintaining oral health while reducing

out-of-pocket

expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans
    include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health
    Maintenance Organization.

Disability.

Disability products provide a
    benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most
    instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid
    until the insured reaches age 65. In addition to



income replacement, the product may be used to provide for the
    payment of business overhead expenses for disabled business
    owners or mortgage payment protection. This is offered on both a
    group and individual basis.

Long-term Care.

LTC products provide
    protection against the potentially high costs of LTC services.
    They generally pay benefits to insureds who need assistance with
    activities of daily living or have a cognitive impairment. In
    November 2010, we announced our decision to discontinue all new
    sales of individual and employer group LTC products, as well as
    our intent to file for an in-force rate increase on our employer
    group business. We remain committed to our existing LTC insureds
    and will ensure that they continue to receive the same high
    level of service.

Retirement
    Products

Our Retirement products segment includes a variety of variable
    and fixed annuities that are primarily sold to individuals and
    employees of corporations and other institutions. The major
    products in this area are:

Variable Annuities.

Variable annuities provide
    for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs.
    Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make deposits
    into various investment options in a separate account, as
    determined by the contractholder. The risks associated with such
    investment options are borne entirely by the contractholder,
    except where guaranteed minimum benefits are involved. In
    certain variable annuity products, contractholders may also
    choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. In addition,
    contractholders may also elect certain minimum death benefit and
    minimum living benefit guarantees for which additional fees are
    charged.

Fixed Annuities.

Fixed annuities provide for
    both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed
    annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided
    by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the
    preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made
    into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited
    interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited
    periods of time, ranging from one to ten years. Fixed income
    annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
    period of years

and/or

for
    the life of the annuitant.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, management realigned certain
    income annuity products within the Company’s segments to
    better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business
    and began reporting such product results in the Retirement
    Products segment previously reported in the Corporate Benefit
    Funding segment. Accordingly, prior period segment results have
    been adjusted to reflect such product reclassifications. See
    Note 1 and Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.

Corporate
    Benefit Funding

Our Corporate Benefit Funding segment includes an array of
    annuity and investment products, including, guaranteed interest
    products and other stable value products, income annuities, and
    separate account contracts for the investment management of
    defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. This
    segment also includes certain products to fund postretirement
    benefits and company, bank or trust owned life insurance used to
    finance non-qualified benefit programs for executives. The major
    products in this area are:

Stable Value Products.

We offer general
    account guaranteed interest contracts, separate account
    guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to
    support the stable value option of defined contribution plans.
    We also offer private floating rate funding agreements that are
    used for money market funds, securities lending cash collateral
    portfolios and short-term investment funds.

Pensions Closeouts.

We offer general account
    and separate account annuity products, generally in connection
    with the termination of defined benefit pension plans, both in
    the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). We also
    offer partial risk transfer solutions that allow for partial
    transfers of pension liabilities and annuity products that
    include single premium buyouts.



Torts and Settlements.

We offer innovative
    strategies for complex litigation settlements, primarily
    structured settlement annuities.

Capital Markets Investment Products.

Products
    offered include funding agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank
    advances and funding agreement-backed commercial paper.

Other Corporate Benefit Funding Products and
    Services.

We offer specialized life insurance
    products designed specifically to provide solutions for
    non-qualified benefit and retiree benefit funding purposes.

Auto &
    Home

Our Auto & Home segment includes personal lines
    property and casualty insurance offered directly to employees at
    their employer’s worksite, as well as to individuals
    through a variety of retail distribution channels, including
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists, direct
    response marketing and the individual distribution sales group.
    Auto & Home primarily sells auto insurance, which
    represented 68% of Auto & Home’s total net earned
    premiums in 2010. Homeowners and other insurance represented 32%
    of Auto & Home’s total net earned premiums in
    2010. The major products in this area are:

Auto Coverages.

Auto insurance policies
    provide coverage for private passenger automobiles, utility
    automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or
    classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers
    traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist, no
    fault or personal injury protection, as well as collision and
    comprehensive.

Homeowners and Other
    Coverages.

Homeowners’ insurance policies
    provide protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners
    and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage
    to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well
    as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy.
    Other insurance includes personal excess liability (protection
    against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability
    insurance policies), and coverage for recreational vehicles and
    boat owners. Most of Auto & Home’s
    homeowners’ policies are traditional insurance policies for
    dwellings, providing protection for loss on a “replacement
    cost” basis. These policies also provide additional
    coverage for reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by
    policyholders that have been displaced from their homes.

Sales
    Distribution

U.S. Business markets our products and services through
    various distribution groups. Our life insurance and retirement
    products targeted to individuals are sold via sales forces,
    comprised of MetLife employees, in addition to third-party
    organizations. Our group life, non-medical health and corporate
    benefit funding products are sold via sales forces primarily
    comprised of MetLife employees. Personal lines property and
    casualty insurance products are directly marketed to employees
    at their employer’s worksite. Auto & Home
    products are also marketed and sold to individuals by
    independent agents and property and casualty specialists through
    a direct response channel and the individual distribution sales
    group. MetLife sales employees work with all distribution groups
    to better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and
    other intermediaries.

Individual
    Distribution

Our individual distribution sales group targets the large
    middle-income market, as well as affluent individuals, owners of
    small businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized
    companies. We have also been successful in selling our products
    in various multi-cultural markets.

Insurance Products are sold through our individual distribution
    sales group and also through various third-party organizations
    utilizing two models. In the coverage model, wholesalers sell to
    high net worth individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses
    through independent general agencies, financial advisors,
    consultants, brokerage general agencies and other independent
    marketing organizations under contractual arrangements. In the
    point of sale model, wholesalers sell through financial
    intermediaries, including regional broker-dealers, brokerage
    firms, financial planners and banks.



Retirement Products are sold through our individual distribution
    sales group and also through various third-party organizations
    such as regional broker-dealers, New York Stock Exchange
    (“NYSE”) brokerage firms, financial planners and banks.

The individual distribution sales group is comprised of three
    channels: the MetLife distribution channel, a career agency
    system, the New England financial distribution channel, a
    general agency system, and MetLife Resources, a career agency
    system.

The MetLife distribution channel had 5,053 MetLife agents under
    contract in 54 agencies at December 31, 2010. The career
    agency sales force focuses on the large middle-income and
    affluent markets, including multi-cultural markets. We support
    our efforts in multi-cultural markets through targeted
    advertising, specially trained agents and sales literature
    written in various languages.

The New England financial distribution channel included 33
    general agencies providing support to 2,102 general agents and a
    network of independent brokers throughout the U.S. at
    December 31, 2010. The New England financial distribution
    channel targets high net worth individuals, owners of small
    businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies.

MetLife Resources, a focused distribution channel of MetLife,
    markets retirement, annuity and other financial products on a
    national basis through 547 MetLife agents and independent
    brokers at December 31, 2010. MetLife Resources targets the
    nonprofit, educational and healthcare markets.

We market and sell Auto & Home products through
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists, a direct
    response channel and the direct distribution group. In recent
    years, we have increased the number of independent agents
    appointed to sell these products.

In 2010, Auto & Home’s business was concentrated
    in the following states, as measured by amount and percentage of
    total direct earned premiums:

Group
    Distribution

Insurance Products distributes its group life and non-medical
    health products and services through a sales force that is
    segmented by the size of the target customer. Marketing
    representatives sell either directly to corporate and other
    group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or
    consultant. Voluntary products are sold through the same sales
    channels, as well as by specialists for these products.
    Employers have been emphasizing such voluntary products and, as
    a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and
    marketing to such employees in order to further foster sales of
    those products. At December 31, 2010, the group life and
    non-medical health sales channels had 356 marketing
    representatives.

Retirement Products markets its retirement, savings, investment
    and payout annuity products and services to sponsors and
    advisors of benefit plans of all sizes. These products and
    services are offered to private and public pension plans,
    collective bargaining units, nonprofit organizations, recipients
    of structured settlements and the current and retired members of
    these and other institutions.

Corporate Benefit Funding products and services are distributed
    through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers located
    in 12 offices around the country. In addition, the
    retirement & benefits funding organization works with
    individual distribution and group life and non-medical health
    distribution areas to better reach and service customers,
    brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.



Auto & Home is a leading provider of personal lines
    property and casualty insurance products offered to employees at
    their employer’s worksite. At December 31, 2010, 2,215
    employers offered MetLife Auto & Home products to
    their employees.

Group marketing representatives market personal lines property
    and casualty insurance products to employers through a variety
    of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group
    customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences
    marketing efforts to employees. Employees who are interested in
    the auto and homeowners products can call a toll-free number to
    request a quote to purchase coverage and to request payroll
    deduction over the telephone. Auto & Home has also
    developed a proprietary software that permits an employee in
    most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance through
    Auto & Home’s internet website.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
    arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and
    distribution opportunities of group products and services. We
    also seek to sell our group products and services through
    sponsoring organizations and affinity groups. In addition, we
    also provide life and dental coverage to federal employees.

International

Overview

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and
    retirement & savings products to both individuals and
    groups. We focus on markets primarily within Japan, Latin
    America, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. We operate in
    international markets through subsidiaries and affiliates. See
    “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency
    Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability,”
    and “Risk Factors — Our International Operations
    Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including
    Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could
    Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability,”
    and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Japan

Our Japan operation (excluding our Japan joint venture, as
    described below under “— Asia Pacific”) is
    comprised of the business acquired in the Acquisition. Our Japan
    operation is among the largest foreign life insurers in Japan
    and ranks 6th in the Japanese life insurance industry
    measured by total premiums according to the Statistics of Life
    Insurance in Japan 2009. It provides life insurance, accident
    and health insurance, annuities and endowment products to both
    individuals and groups. Its products are distributed through a
    multi-distribution platform consisting of captive agents,
    independent agents, brokers, bancassurance, and direct
    marketing (“DM”).

Latin
    America

We operate in 20 countries in Latin America, with the largest
    operations in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. The Mexican operation
    is the largest life insurance company in both the individual and
    group businesses in Mexico according to Asociación Mexicana
    de Instituciones de Seguro, a Mexican industry trade group which
    provides rankings for insurance companies. Our Chilean operation
    is the largest annuity company in Chile, based on market share
    according to Superintendencia Valores y Seguros, the Chilean
    insurance regulator. The Chilean operation also offers
    individual life insurance and group insurance products. We also
    actively market individual life insurance, group insurance
    products and credit life coverage in Argentina, but the
    nationalization of the pension system substantially reduced our
    presence in Argentina. The business environment in Argentina has
    been, and may continue to be, affected by governmental and legal
    actions which impact our results of operations.

Asia
    Pacific

We operate in 5 countries in Asia Pacific with the largest
    operations in South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia. Our South
    Korean operation has significant sales of variable universal
    life and annuity products. Our Hong Kong operation has
    significant sales of variable universal life and endowment
    products. Our Australia operation has significant sales of
    credit insurance and group life products. We also operate
    through joint ventures in Japan and China, the results of which
    are reflected in net investment income and are not consolidated
    in the financial results.



We have a quota share reinsurance agreement with the joint
    venture in Japan, whereby we assume 100% of the living and death
    guarantee benefits associated with the variable annuity business
    written after April 2005 by the joint venture. As discussed in
    Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company reached an agreement to sell its 50%
    interest in the joint venture in Japan.

Europe
    and the Middle East

We operate in 39 countries in Europe and the Middle East with
    our largest operations in Poland, the U.K., France, and the
    United Arab Emirates, as well as through a consolidated joint
    venture in India. Our Poland operation is a leading provider of
    life insurance, accident and health insurance, and credit
    insurance. It is consistently ranked as a top 3 company in
    net profits according to “Rzeczpospolita” financial
    daily. Our U.K. operation provides life insurance, accident and
    health insurance and variable annuities in its home market and
    throughout Europe. Our operation in France provides life
    insurance, accident and health insurance and credit insurance.
    In the Middle East, we provide life insurance, accident and
    health insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and
    retirement & savings products.

Sales
    Distribution

International markets its products and services through a
    multi-distribution strategy which varies by geographic region.
    The various distribution channels include: agency,
    bancassurance, DM, brokerage and

e-commerce.

In developing countries, agency covers the needs of the emerging
    middle class with primarily traditional products (e.g.,
    endowment and accident and health). In more developed and mature
    markets, agents, while continuing to serve their existing
    customers to keep pace with their developing financial needs,
    also target upper middle class and high net worth customer bases
    with a more sophisticated product set including more
    investment-sensitive products, such as universal life, mutual
    fund and single premium deposits.

In the bancassurance channel, International leverages
    partnerships that span all regions. In addition, DM has
    extensive and far reaching capabilities in all regions. The DM
    operations deploy both broadcast marketing approaches (e.g.
    direct response TV, web-based lead generation) and traditional
    DM techniques such as telemarketing. Japan represents the
    largest DM market.

Japan

Japan’s multi-channel distribution strategy consists of
    captive agents, independent agents, bancassurance and DM. While

face-to-face

channels continue to be core to Japan’s business, other
    channels, including bancassurance and DM, have become a critical
    part of Japan’s distribution strategy. Our Japan operation
    has maintained its position in bancassurance due to its strong
    distribution relationship with Japan’s mega banks, trust
    banks and various regional banks, as well as with the Japan
    Post. The DM channel is supported by an industry-leading
    marketing platform,

state-of-the-art

call center infrastructure and its own campaign management
    system.

Japan has 5,397 captive agents, 10,642 independent agents, 96
    bancassurance relationships, including Japan Post, and 195
    DM sponsors.

Latin
    America

Latin America’s key distribution channels include captive
    agents, large multinational brokers and small-and medium-sized
    brokers, direct and group sales forces (mostly for group
    policies without broker intermediation), DM, bancassurance and
    worksite marketing. The region has an exclusive and captive
    agency distribution network with more than 3,000 agents also
    selling a variety of individual life, accident and health, and
    pension products (“AFORE”), as well as small- and
    medium-sized group life and medical solutions products. We
    currently work with over 3,300 active brokers with registered
    sales of group and individual life, accident and health, group
    medical, dental and pension products. Worksite marketing has
    over 2,300 agents.



Asia
    Pacific

In Asia Pacific, distribution strategies differ by country but
    generally utilize a combination of captive agents, bancassurance
    relationships and DM. Agency sales are achieved through a force
    of approximately 7,500 agents and a growing force of independent
    general agents. Bancassurance sales are currently reliant upon a
    significant regional strategic partnership along with a number
    of smaller partnerships in each market. Throughout the region,
    our Asia Pacific operation leverages its expertise in DM
    operations management to conduct its own campaigns and provide
    those DM capabilities to third-party sponsors.

While not a significant part of the region’s overall
    business, sales of group life and pension business are primarily
    achieved through independent brokers and an employee sales force.

Europe
    and the Middle East

Our operation in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”)
    has a multi-channel distribution strategy, which includes
    significant face to face channels, built on a strong captive
    agency force of more than 3,450 agents, and relationships with
    more than 150 independent brokers and third-party multi-level
    agency networks. Our CEE operation also has a group/corporate
    business direct sales force of more than 70 and distribution
    relationships with more than 90 banks, other financial and non
    financial institutions, as well as a fast growing DM channel.
    The primary method of distribution is captive and third party
    agency and captive direct sales forces, with a growing presence
    in bank, other financial and non financial institutions,
    and DM.

Our operation in Continental Western Europe (“CWE”)
    also has a multi-channel distribution strategy, including DM,
    brokerage, banks and financial institutions. Our U.K. operation
    has built a strong position in the U.K. independent financial
    advisor sector through its strong distribution relationships
    with Britain’s leading advisory networks, serving the
    mainstream markets specializing particularly in guaranteed
    products. Recent arrangements with two U.K. banks should enhance
    our distribution capability going forward. Our U.K. operation
    also has an agency force which focuses on the protection market.

In the Middle East, our products are distributed via a variety
    of channels including approximately 16,400 agents,
    bancassurance, brokers and DM. Agency distribution is the
    primary channel, with MetLife having the largest captive network
    in the Middle East. Bancassurance is a growing channel with
    approximately 100 relationships, and approximately 250
    programs providing access to millions of bank customers.

Banking,
    Corporate & Other

Banking, Corporate & Other contains the excess capital
    not allocated to the segments, which is invested to optimize
    investment spread and to fund company initiatives and various

start-up

and
    run-off entities. Banking, Corporate & Other also
    includes interest expense related to the majority of our
    outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings, as well as the financial results of MetLife Bank,
    which offers a variety of mortgage and deposit products. The
    elimination of transactions from activity between
    U.S. Business, International, and Banking,
    Corporate & Other occurs within Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

Mortgage products offered by MetLife Bank include forward and
    reverse residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans
    are originated through MetLife Bank’s national sales force,
    mortgage brokers and mortgage correspondents.

The residential mortgage banking activities include the
    origination and servicing of mortgage loans. Mortgage loans are

held-for-investment

or sold primarily into Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    (“FHLMC”) or Government National Mortgage Association
    (“GNMA”) securities. MetLife Bank also leverages
    MetLife’s investment platform to source commercial and
    agriculture loans as investments on its balance sheet. MetLife
    Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
    Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB of NY”) and is
    subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Office
    of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and
    secondarily by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    (“FDIC”) and the Federal Reserve.



The origination of forward and reverse mortgage single family
    loans include both variable and fixed rate products. MetLife
    Bank does not originate

sub-prime

or
    alternative residential mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) and
    the funding for the mortgage banking activities is provided by
    deposits and borrowings.

Deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money
    market savings accounts, certificates of deposit
    (“CDs”) and individual retirement accounts. MetLife
    Bank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry
    Service program through which certain customer CDs are exchanged
    for CDs of similar amounts from participating banks. The deposit
    products provide a relatively stable source of funding and
    liquidity and are used to fund securities and loans. In
    addition, MetLife Bank principally seeks deposits from direct
    customers via the Internet and postal mail, and takes advantage
    of cross-marketing opportunities, including through voluntary
    benefits platforms of its affiliates’ customers.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined
    amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when
    a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes
    disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to
    provide for future annuity payments. We compute the amounts for
    actuarial liabilities reported in our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on
    Policyholder Liabilities see “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Liability for Future Policy Benefits”
    and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder
    Liabilities.”

Pursuant to state insurance laws and country regulators, the
    Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries establish
    statutory reserves, reported as liabilities, to meet their
    obligations on their respective policies. These statutory
    reserves are established in amounts sufficient to meet policy
    and contract obligations, when taken together with expected
    future premiums and interest at assumed rates. Statutory
    reserves generally differ from actuarial liabilities for future
    policy benefits determined using GAAP.

The New York Insurance Law and regulations require certain
    MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of
    Insurance or other state insurance departments, with each annual
    report, an opinion and memorandum of a “qualified
    actuary” that the statutory reserves and related actuarial
    amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts,
    and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related
    actuarial amounts, make adequate provision for their statutory
    liabilities with respect to these obligations. See
    “— U.S. Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.”

Underwriting
    and Pricing

Underwriting

Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications
    for Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit
    Funding, and Auto & Home by a professional staff of
    underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the
    amount of risk that we are willing to accept. In addition to the
    products described above, with the exception of Auto &
    Home, International also offers credit insurance, accident and
    health, and medical products. We employ detailed underwriting
    policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the
    underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks before issuing
    policies to qualified applicants or groups.

Insurance underwriting considers not only an applicant’s
    medical history, but also other factors such as financial
    profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco
    use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk
    characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with
    certain voluntary products and for certain coverages, members of
    a group may be underwritten on an individual basis. We generally
    perform our own underwriting; however, certain policies are
    reviewed by intermediaries under guidelines established by us.
    Generally, we are not obligated to accept any risk or group of
    risks from, or to issue a policy or group of policies to, any
    employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage are reviewed on
    their merits and generally a policy is not issued unless the
    particular risk or group has been examined and approved by our
    underwriters.



Our remote underwriting offices, intermediaries, as well as our
    corporate underwriting office, are periodically reviewed via
    continuous on-going internal underwriting audits to maintain
    high-standards of underwriting and consistency. Such offices are
    also subject to periodic external audits by reinsurers with whom
    we do business.

We have established senior level oversight of the underwriting
    process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of
    our customers, while supporting our financial strength and
    business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting,
    mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in
    our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and
    establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and
    strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer,
    the agent and us.

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six
    principal aspects: evaluating potential worksite marketing
    employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing
    guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by
    agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case
    basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding
    authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to
    enable Auto & Home to issue a policy within our
    guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be
    written at rates commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the
    U.S. Business distribution channels have binding authority
    for risks which fall within its published underwriting
    guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines
    may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department;
    alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the
    underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk
    themselves. In most states, we generally have the right within a
    specified period (usually the first 60 days) to cancel any
    policy.

Pricing

Pricing has traditionally reflected our corporate underwriting
    standards. Product pricing is based on the expected payout of
    benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for
    mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment
    returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as
    inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based on
    various factors, which may include investment return, expenses,
    persistency and optionality. For certain investment oriented
    products in the U.S. and certain business sold
    internationally, pricing may include prospective and
    retrospective experience rating features. Prospective experience
    rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the
    purpose of determining future premium rates and all prior year
    gains and losses are borne by us. Retrospective experience
    rating also involves the evaluation of past experience for the
    purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance
    for the customer, however, the contract includes certain
    features that allow us to recoup certain losses or distribute
    certain gains back to the policyholder based on actual prior
    years’ experience.

Rates for group life, non-medical health, and medical health
    products are based on anticipated results for the book of
    business being underwritten. Renewals are generally reevaluated
    annually or biannually and are repriced to reflect actual
    experience on such products. Products offered by Corporate
    Benefit Funding are priced frequently and are very responsive to
    bond yields, and such prices include additional margin in
    periods of market uncertainty. This business is predominantly
    illiquid, because a majority of the policyholders have no
    contractual rights to cash values and no options to change the
    form of the product’s benefits.

Rates for individual life insurance products are highly
    regulated and must be approved by the regulators of the
    jurisdictions in which the product is sold. Generally such
    products are renewed annually and may include pricing terms that
    are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Fixed and variable
    annuity products are also highly regulated and approved by the
    respective regulators. Such products generally include penalties
    for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to
    tailor the form of the product’s benefits to the needs of
    the opting policyholder. We periodically reevaluate the costs
    associated with such options and will periodically adjust
    pricing levels on our guarantees. Further, from time to time, we
    may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee features
    currently being offered.

Rates for Auto & Home’s major lines of insurance
    are based on its proprietary database, rather than relying on
    rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in part
    from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of
    personal lines insurance products takes into account, among
    other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the
    costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring
    policyholders and administering policy



benefits and other administrative and overhead costs),
    competitive factors and profit considerations. The major pricing
    variables for personal lines insurance include characteristics
    of the insured property, such as age, make and model or
    construction type, as well as characteristics of the insureds,
    such as driving record and loss experience, and the
    insured’s personal financial management. Auto &
    Home’s ability to set and change rates is subject to
    regulatory oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state,
    Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is
    required to write or share the cost of private passenger
    automobile insurance for higher risk individuals who would
    otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This
    “involuntary” market, also called the “shared
    market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations
    of each state, and policies written in this market are generally
    written at rates higher than standard rates.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. The current
    economic environment, with its volatility and uncertainty is not
    expected to materially impact the pricing of our products.

Reinsurance
    Activity

We participate in reinsurance activities in order to limit
    losses, minimize exposure to significant risks, and provide
    additional capacity for future growth. We enter into various
    agreements with reinsurers that cover individual risks, group
    risks or defined blocks of business, primarily on a coinsurance,
    yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess basis. These
    reinsurance agreements spread risk and minimize the effect of
    losses. The extent of each risk retained by us depends on our
    evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in certain
    circumstances, to maximum retention limits based on the
    characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar
    mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to
    reinsuring mortality risk, we reinsure other risks, as well as
    specific coverages. We obtain reinsurance for capital
    requirement purposes and also when the economic impact of the
    reinsurance agreement makes it appropriate to do so.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer
    agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim
    is paid. Cessions under reinsurance arrangements do not
    discharge our obligations as the primary insurer. In the event
    that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the terms of
    the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance balances recoverable
    could become uncollectible.

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of
    well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. We analyze recent
    trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if
    any, with our reinsurers. We monitor ratings and evaluate the
    financial strength of our reinsurers by analyzing their
    financial statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable
    balance due from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the
    overall monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance
    recoverable balances is evaluated based on these analyses. We
    generally secure large reinsurance recoverable balances with
    various forms of collateral, including secured trusts, funds
    withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit.

U.S.
    Business

For our individual life insurance products, we have historically
    reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess of retention
    basis or a quota share basis. We currently reinsure 90% of the
    mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most products
    and reinsure up to 90% of the mortality risk for certain other
    products. In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described
    above, we reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages.
    Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis
    and also on a facultative basis for risks with specified
    characteristics. On a case by case basis, we may retain up to
    $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of amounts in excess
    of the amount we retain. We evaluate our reinsurance programs
    routinely and may increase or decrease our retention at any time.

For other policies within the Insurance Products segment, we
    generally retain most of the risk and only cede particular risks
    on certain client arrangements.

Our Retirement Products segment reinsures a portion of the
    living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with
    our variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, we
    pay a reinsurance premium



generally based on fees associated with the guarantees collected
    from policyholders, and receive reimbursement for benefits paid
    or accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain
    limitations.

Our Corporate Benefit Funding segment has periodically engaged
    in reinsurance activities, as considered appropriate.

Our Auto & Home segment purchases reinsurance to
    manage its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe
    losses) and to protect statutory surplus. We cede to reinsurers
    a portion of losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the
    policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large
    property and casualty losses, we utilize property catastrophe,
    casualty and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

International

For certain of our life insurance products, we reinsure risks
    above the corporate retention limit of up to $5 million to
    external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. We may
    also reinsure certain risks with external reinsurers depending
    upon the nature of the risk and local regulatory requirements.

For selected large corporate clients, our International segment
    reinsures group employee benefits or credit insurance business
    with various client-affiliated reinsurance companies, covering
    policies issued to the employees or customers of the clients.
    Additionally, we cede and assume risk with other insurance
    companies when either company requires a business partner with
    the appropriate local licensing to issue certain types of
    policies in certain countries. In these cases, the assuming
    company typically underwrites the risks, develops the products
    and assumes most or all of the risk.

Our International segment also has reinsurance agreements in
    force that reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit
    guarantees issued in connection with our variable annuities.
    Under these agreements, we pay reinsurance fees associated with
    the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive
    reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account
    values, subject to certain limitations.

Banking,
    Corporate & Other

We also reinsure through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements
    certain run-off LTC and workers’ compensation business
    written by MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut
    (“MICC”), a subsidiary of the Company.

Catastrophe
    Coverage

We have exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute to
    significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We also
    use excess of retention and quota share reinsurance arrangements
    to provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure
    to larger risks. For our International segment, we currently
    purchase catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain
    countries deemed by management to be exposed to the greatest
    catastrophic risks.

    receivables in the consolidated balance sheets, see Note 9
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S.
    Regulation

Insurance
    Regulation

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”) is
    licensed to transact insurance business in, and is subject to
    regulation and supervision by, all 50 states, the District
    of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin
    Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Each of MetLife’s
    insurance subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each
    U.S. and international jurisdiction where it conducts
    insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies, but
    most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the
    financial aspects of insurers, including standards of



solvency, statutory reserves, reinsurance and capital adequacy,
    and the business conduct of insurers. In addition, statutes and
    regulations usually require the licensing of insurers and their
    agents, the approval of policy forms and certain other related
    materials and, for certain lines of insurance, the approval of
    rates. Such statutes and regulations also prescribe the
    permitted types and concentration of investments. New York
    Insurance Law limits the amount of compensation that insurers
    doing business in New York may pay to their agents, as well as
    the amount of total expenses, including sales commissions and
    marketing expenses, that such insurers may incur in connection
    with the sale of life insurance policies and annuity contracts
    throughout the U.S.

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally
    including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance
    regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it
    does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to
    periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries
    must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of
    insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms
    relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which
    they operate.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) has established a program of accrediting
    state insurance departments. NAIC accreditation contemplates
    that accredited states will conduct periodic examinations of
    insurers domiciled in such states. NAIC-accredited states will
    not accept reports of examination of insurers from unaccredited
    states, except under limited circumstances. As a direct result,
    insurers domiciled in unaccredited states may be subject to
    financial examination by accredited states in which they are
    licensed, in addition to any examinations conducted by their
    domiciliary states. In 2009, the New York State Department of
    Insurance (the “Department”), MLIC’s principal
    insurance regulator, received accreditation from the NAIC.
    Previously, the Department was not accredited by the NAIC, but
    the absence of this accreditation did not have a significant
    impact upon our ability to conduct our insurance businesses.

State and federal insurance and securities regulatory
    authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and
    attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding
    compliance by the Holding Company and its insurance subsidiaries
    with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations
    regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities
    businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective
    action when warranted. See Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holding Company Regulation.

The Holding
    Company and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various
    jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and
    regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but
    generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that
    are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register
    with state regulatory authorities and to file with those
    authorities certain reports, including information concerning
    its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
    intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
    companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its
    affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Dividends from Subsidiaries.”

Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.

Most of the jurisdictions in which
    our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact
    business require life and property and casualty insurers doing
    business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty
    associations, which are organized to pay certain contractual
    insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by
    impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy
    assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in
    a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of
    the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business
    in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged.
    Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid
    through full or partial premium tax offsets.

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against
    MetLife have not been material. We have established liabilities
    for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate for
    assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject
    to insolvency proceedings. See Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    the insolvency assessments.



Statutory Insurance Examination.

As part of
    their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments
    conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records,
    accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
    states. State insurance departments also have the authority to
    conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are
    licensed in their states. During the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2010, MetLife has not received any material
    adverse findings resulting from state insurance department
    examinations of its insurance subsidiaries conducted during this
    three-year period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states, Financial
    Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and,
    occasionally, the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries
    relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or
    annuities or other products by MLIC, MetLife Securities, Inc.,
    New England Life Insurance Company, New England Securities
    Corporation, General American Life Insurance Company, Walnut
    Street Securities, Inc., MICC and Tower Square Securities, Inc.
    These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular
    financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered
    or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the
    past several years, these and a number of investigations by
    other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments
    and certain other relief, including restitution payments. We may
    continue to resolve investigations in a similar manner.

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.

Annually, our U.S. insurance
    subsidiaries are required to conduct an analysis of the
    sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each case, a qualified
    actuary must submit an opinion which states that the statutory
    reserves, when considered in light of the assets held with
    respect to such reserves, make good and sufficient provision for
    the associated contractual obligations and related expenses of
    the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be provided, the insurer
    must set up additional reserves by moving funds from surplus.
    Since inception of this requirement, our U.S. insurance
    subsidiaries which are required by their states of domicile to
    provide these opinions have provided such opinions without
    qualifications.

Surplus and Capital.

Our U.S. insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to the supervision of the regulators in
    each jurisdiction in which they are licensed to transact
    business. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection
    with the continued licensing of these insurance subsidiaries, to
    limit or prohibit sales to policyholders if, in their judgment,
    the regulators determine that such insurer has not maintained
    the minimum surplus or capital or that the further transaction
    of business will be hazardous to policyholders. See
    “— Risk-Based Capital.”

Risk-Based Capital
    (“

RBC

”).

Each of our
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries that is subject to RBC
    requirements reports its RBC based on a formula calculated by
    applying factors to various asset, premium and statutory reserve
    items, as well as taking into account the risk characteristics
    of the insurer. The major categories of risk involved are asset
    risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk, market risk and
    business risk. The formula is used as an early warning
    regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized
    insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action, and not
    as a means to rank insurers generally. State insurance laws
    provide insurance regulators the authority to require various
    actions by, or take various actions against, insurers whose RBC
    ratio does not meet or exceed certain RBC levels. As of the date
    of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed
    with insurance regulators, the RBC of each of these subsidiaries
    was in excess of each of those RBC levels. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company —
    Capital.”

Statutory Accounting Principles.

The NAIC
    provides standardized insurance industry accounting and
    reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and
    Procedures Manual (the “Manual”). However, statutory
    accounting principles continue to be established by individual
    state laws, regulations and permitted practices. The Department
    has adopted the Manual with certain modifications for the
    preparation of statutory financial statements of insurance
    companies domiciled in New York. Changes to the Manual or
    modifications by the various state insurance departments may
    impact the statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Regulation of Investments.

Each of our
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and
    regulations that require diversification of our investment
    portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain asset
    categories, such as below investment grade fixed income
    securities, equity real estate, other equity investments, and
    derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations
    would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be
    treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus
    and, in some instances, would



require divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We
    believe that the investments made by each of the Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with
    such regulations at December 31, 2010.

Until various studies are completed and final regulations are
    promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
    Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), the full
    impact of Dodd-Frank on the investments, investment activities
    and insurance and annuity products of the Company remain
    unclear. See “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of
    Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital
    Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Federal Initiatives.

Although the federal
    government generally does not directly regulate the insurance
    business, federal initiatives often have an impact on our
    business in a variety of ways. See “Risk
    Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact
    Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability
    and Limit Our Growth.” From time to time, federal measures
    are proposed which may significantly affect the insurance
    business. These areas include financial services regulation,
    securities regulation, pension regulation, health care
    regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In
    addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal
    regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time,
    including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal
    charter for insurance companies. Dodd-Frank established the
    Federal Insurance Office within the Department of Treasury to
    collect information about the insurance industry, recommend
    prudential standards, and represent the U.S. in dealings
    with foreign insurance regulators. See “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.”

Financial
    Holding Company Regulation

Regulatory Agencies.

As the owner of a
    federally-chartered bank, MetLife, Inc. is a bank holding
    company and financial holding company. As such, the Holding
    Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company
    Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to
    inspection, examination, and supervision by the Board of
    Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In addition,
    MetLife Bank is subject to regulation and examination primarily
    by the OCC and secondarily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York and the FDIC, as described below under “— Banking
    Regulation.”

Financial Holding Company Activities.

As a
    financial holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and
    investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to
    those that are “financial” in nature or
    “incidental” or “complementary” to such
    financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature
    include securities underwriting, dealing and market making,
    sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance
    underwriting and agency, merchant banking and activities that
    the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related
    to banking. In addition, under the insurance company investment
    portfolio provision of the GLB Act, financial holding companies
    are authorized to make investments in other financial and
    non-financial companies, through their insurance subsidiaries,
    that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
    with state insurance law, provided the financial holding company
    does not routinely manage or operate such companies except as
    may be necessary to obtain a reasonable return on investment.
    Under Dodd-Frank, as a large, interconnected bank holding
    company with assets of $50 billion or more, or possibly as
    an otherwise systemically important financial company, MetLife,
    Inc. will be subject to enhanced prudential standards imposed on
    systemically significant financial companies. Enhanced standards
    will be applied to RBC, liquidity, leverage (unless another,
    similar standard is appropriate for the Company), resolution
    plan and credit exposure reporting, concentration limits, and
    risk management. The so-called “Volcker Rule”
    provisions of Dodd-Frank restrict the ability of affiliates of
    insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) to engage
    in proprietary trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or
    private equity funds. See “Risk Factors — Various
    Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations,
    Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.”

Capital.

MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank are
    subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines issued by
    the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and financial
    holding companies. The federal banking regulatory agencies are
    required by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with
    respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital
    standards. MetLife, Inc. may become required to comply with
    further requirements relating to the



calculation of capital, commonly referred to as “Basel
    II,” which could require significant investment by the
    Company, including software. In addition, in December 2010, the
    Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published its final rules
    for increased capital and liquidity requirements (commonly
    referred to as “Basel III”) for bank holding
    companies, such as MetLife, Inc. Assuming these requirements are
    endorsed and adopted by the U.S., they are to be phased in
    beginning January 1, 2013. It is possible that even more
    stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed
    under Dodd-Frank if MetLife, Inc. is determined to be a
    systemically important company. The ability of MetLife Bank and
    MetLife, Inc. to pay dividends could be reduced by any
    additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a
    result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank

and/or

the
    endorsement and adoption by the U.S. of Basel III. See
    “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank
    Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.” At December 31, 2010, MetLife, Inc. and
    MetLife Bank were in compliance with applicable requirements
    currently in effect.

Consumer Protection Laws.

Numerous other
    federal and state laws also affect the Holding Company’s
    and MetLife Bank’s earnings and activities, including
    federal and state consumer protection laws. The GLB Act included
    consumer privacy provisions that, among other things, require
    disclosure of a financial institution’s privacy policy to
    customers. In addition, these provisions permit states to adopt
    more extensive privacy protections through legislation or
    regulation. As part of Dodd-Frank, Congress established the
    Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to supervise and
    regulate institutions that provide certain financial products
    and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial
    services subject to the Bureau’s jurisdiction generally
    exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the
    Bureau does have authority to regulate consumer services
    provided by MetLife Bank.

Change of Control and Restrictions on Mergers and
    Acquisitions.

Because MetLife, Inc. is a
    financial holding company and bank holding company, no person
    may acquire control of MetLife, Inc. without the prior approval
    of the Federal Reserve Board. A change of control is
    conclusively presumed upon acquisition of 25% or more of any
    class of voting securities and rebuttably presumed upon
    acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities.
    Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.’s ownership of
    MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC would be required in
    connection with a change of control (generally presumed upon the
    acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities) of
    MetLife, Inc. As a result of Dodd-Frank, Federal Reserve
    approval would be required after July 21, 2011, for any
    acquisition of a non-bank firm by a bank holding company having
    more than $10 billion of assets, such as MetLife, Inc. As a
    bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more,
    MetLife, Inc. will be required to provide prior notice to the
    Federal Reserve before acquiring control of voting shares of a
    company engaged in financial activities that has
    $10 billion or more of consolidated assets. MetLife, Inc.
    received the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to
    consummating the Acquisition.

Banking
    Regulation

As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is
    subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and
    guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the
    business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as
    well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC and
    secondarily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the
    FDIC. Federal banking laws and regulations address various
    aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with
    respect to, among other things, chartering to carry on business
    as a bank; maintaining minimum capital ratios; capital
    management in relation to the bank’s assets; safety and
    soundness standards; loan loss and other statutory reserves;
    liquidity; financial reporting and disclosure standards;
    counterparty credit concentration; restrictions on related party
    and affiliate transactions; lending limits; payment of interest;
    unfair or deceptive acts or practices; privacy; and bank holding
    company and bank change of control. MetLife Bank is also subject
    to the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Consumer Financial
    Protection created by Dodd-Frank to promulgate and enforce
    consumer protection rules for certain kinds of financial
    products.

Dodd-Frank

established a statutory standard for Federal preemption of state
    consumer financial protection laws, which standard will require
    national banks to comply with many state consumer financial
    protection laws that previously were considered preempted by
    Federal law. The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks
    for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to
    depositors. Federal and state banking regulators regularly



re-examine

existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their
    products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the bank.

Securities,
    Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation

Some of our subsidiaries and their activities in offering and
    selling variable insurance products are subject to extensive
    regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
    These subsidiaries issue variable annuity contracts and variable
    life insurance policies through separate accounts that are
    registered with the SEC as investment companies under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment
    Company Act”). Each registered separate account is
    generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and
    variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts
    are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the “Securities Act”). Other subsidiaries are
    registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
    and are members of, and subject to, regulation by FINRA.
    Further, some of our subsidiaries are registered as investment
    advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
    as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and are
    also registered as investment advisers in various states, as
    applicable. Certain variable contract separate accounts
    sponsored by our subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but
    may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities
    laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA
    from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations
    regarding compliance by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries
    with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate
    with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action
    when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to protect investors in the securities markets and
    generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and
    enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the
    conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and
    regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and
    regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide
    investment advisory services, offer products similar to those
    described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental
    Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to
    extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also
    the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities
    and costs in connection with any required remediation of such
    properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies
    that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities.
    We routinely have environmental assessments performed with
    respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real
    property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide
    assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not
    arise. However, based on information currently available to us,
    we believe that any costs associated with compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such
    properties will not have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”)
    Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit
    plans that are subject to ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities
    are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code,
    including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must
    perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan
    participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA
    and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to
    engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain
    relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable
    provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by
    the Department of Labor (“DOL”), the Internal Revenue
    Service (“IRS”) and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
    Corporation.

In

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris Trust
    and Savings Bank (1993),

the U.S. Supreme Court held
    that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to satisfy
    guaranteed obligations under a participating group annuity
    general account contract are “plan assets.” Therefore,
    these assets are subject to certain fiduciary



obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform
    their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants
    and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of
    Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an
    insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer’s general
    account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which
    assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of
    ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a
    policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998
    (“Transition Policy”). No person will generally be
    liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to
    July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance
    company general account assets constitute plan assets. An
    insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general
    account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after
    December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary
    obligations under ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed
    benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so
    that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be
    considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These
    requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the
    employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must
    permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day
    notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s
    option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance
    (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a
    book value payment of such amount in annual installments with
    interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to
    ensure compliance with these regulations.

Legislative
    and Regulatory Developments

Dodd-Frank, enacted in July 2010, effected the most far-reaching
    overhaul of financial regulation in the U.S. in decades.
    Dodd-Frank also establishes the framework for new regulations
    relating to prudential standards for systemically significant
    financial companies, certain investment activities, consumer
    protection, the liquidation of bank holding companies,
    derivative transitions, corporate governance and executive
    compensation. These changes are particularly relevant to the
    Company as an insurer, public company and bank holding company.
    The potential impact of these changes on the Company are more
    fully discussed under “Risk Factors — Various
    Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations,
    Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth,” “Risk Factors — Our Insurance,
    Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and
    Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth” and “Risk Factors — New
    and Impending Compensation and Corporate Governance Regulations
    Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining
    Management and Other Employees with the Talent and Experience to
    Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively.” The full
    impact of Dodd-Frank on us will depend on the numerous
    rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by Dodd-Frank and
    the various studies mandated by Dodd-Frank, which are scheduled
    to be completed over the next few years.

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what
    legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any
    such legislation on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

International
    Regulation

With the acquisition of ALICO, the Company has significantly
    expanded its scope of operations in foreign jurisdictions. The
    Company’s international operations are regulated in the
    jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. The
    Company’s international insurance operations are subject to
    minimum capital, solvency and operational requirements. The
    authority of the Company’s international operations to
    conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits
    and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to
    modification and revocation. Periodic examinations of insurance
    company books and records, financial reporting requirements,
    market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are
    among the techniques used by regulators to supervise our

non-U.S. insurance

businesses. The Company also has investment and pension
    companies in certain foreign jurisdictions that provide mutual
    fund, pension and other financial products and services. Those
    entities are subject to securities, investment, pension and
    other laws and regulations, and oversight by the relevant
    securities, pension and other authorities of the countries in
    which the companies operate.

The Company’s international operations are exposed to
    increased political, legal, financial, operational and other
    risks. Our international operations may be materially adversely
    affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and
    regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of
    assets, the imposition of limits



on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws
    (including tax laws and regulations), their application or
    interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations,
    price controls, currency exchange controls or other restrictions
    that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations
    out of the countries in which they operate or converting local
    currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies,
    as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental
    authorities and regulators. Such actions may negatively affect
    our business in these jurisdictions. See “Risk
    Factors — Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local
    and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability.”

Certain of the Company’s international insurance
    operations, including Japan, may be subject to assessments,
    generally based on their proportionate share of business written
    in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations to
    policyholders and claimants resulting from the insolvency of
    insurance companies. Under the Japanese Insurance Business Law,
    all licensed life insurers in Japan are assessed on a pre-funded
    basis by the Life Insurance Policyholders Protection Corporation
    of Japan. These assessments are aggregated across all licensed
    life insurers in Japan and used to satisfy certain obligations
    to policyholders and claimants of insolvent life insurance
    companies. As we cannot predict the timing and scope of future
    assessments, they may materially affect the results of
    operations of the Company’s international insurance
    operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. In
    addition, in some jurisdictions, some of the Company’s
    insurance products are considered “securities” under
    local law and may be subject to local securities regulations and
    oversight by local securities regulators.

Our operations in Japan are subject to regulation and
    examination by Japan’s Financial Services Agency
    (“FSA”). Our operations in Japan are required to file
    with the FSA annual reports which include financial statements.
    Similar to the U.S., Japanese law provides that insurers in
    Japan must maintain specified solvency standards for the
    protection of policyholders and to support the financial
    strength of licensed insurers. As of September 30, 2010,
    the date of our most recent regulatory filing in Japan, the
    solvency margin ratio of our Japan operations was 1,466%, which
    is significantly in excess of the legally mandated solvency
    margin in Japan. The FSA has issued a proposal to revise the
    current method of calculating the solvency margin ratio. The FSA
    intends to apply the revised method to life insurance companies
    for the fiscal year-end 2011 (March 31, 2012) for life
    insurance companies in Japan, and require the disclosure of the
    ratio as reference information for fiscal year-end 2010
    (March 31, 2011).

A portion of the annual earnings of our Japan operations may be
    repatriated each year, and may further be distributed to the
    Holding Company as a dividend. We may determine not to
    repatriate profits from the Japan operations or to repatriate a
    reduced amount in order to maintain or improve the solvency
    margin of the Japan operations or for other reasons. In
    addition, the FSA may limit or not permit profit repatriations
    or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers would
    be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of our
    Japan operations or for other reasons.

In addition, the European Commission has established
    Solvency II as a new capital adequacy regime for the
    European insurance industry, which will become effective
    beginning in 2013. Solvency II sets capital standards for
    insurers on a risk basis and has a three-pillar structure
    covering quantitative requirements, supervisory review, and
    market disclosure. Regulators in certain other countries, such
    as Mexico, are also establishing new capital regimes similar to
    Solvency II. Compliance with these new capital standards
    may impact the level of capital required to be held at
    individual legal entities. Further, the efforts required to
    comply with these regulations may increase operating costs at
    these entities.

We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the
    U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to continue to
    increase. That oversight, and the legal and regulatory
    environment in the countries in which the Company operates,
    could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    results of operations.

Governmental
    Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions

U.S.
    Federal Governmental Responses

Dodd-Frank was enacted in response to the recent economic
    crisis. See “— Legislative and Regulatory
    Developments.” Actions taken by Congress, the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Treasury and other



agencies of the U.S. Federal government prior to the
    enactment of Dodd-Frank were increasingly aggressive and,
    together with a series of interest rate reductions that began in
    the second half of 2007, intended to provide liquidity to
    financial institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor
    confidence in particular troubled institutions and to prevent or
    contain the spread of the financial crisis. These measures
    included:

•

expanding the types of institutions that have access to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s discount window;

•

providing asset guarantees and emergency loans to particular
    distressed companies;

•

a temporary ban on short selling of shares of certain financial
    institutions (including, for a period, MetLife);

•

programs intended to reduce the volume of mortgage foreclosures
    by modifying the terms of mortgage loans for distressed
    borrowers;

•

temporarily guaranteeing money market funds; and

•

programs to support the mortgage-backed securities market and
    mortgage lending.

Many of the actions outlined above expired or terminated by
    mid-2010 or earlier.

In addition to these actions, pursuant to the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), enacted in October
    2008, the U.S. Treasury injected capital into selected
    financial institutions and their holding companies. EESA also
    authorized the U.S. Treasury to purchase mortgage-backed
    and other securities from financial institutions as part of the
    overall $700 billion available for the purpose of
    stabilizing the financial markets; this authority expired in
    October 2010. The Federal government, the Federal Reserve Bank
    of New York, FDIC and other governmental and regulatory bodies
    also took other actions to address the financial crisis. For
    example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York made funds
    available to commercial and financial companies under a number
    of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility
    (the “CPFF”), and the FDIC established the Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “FDIC Program”). In
    March 2009, MetLife, Inc. issued $397 million of senior
    notes guaranteed by the FDIC under the FDIC Program. The FDIC
    Program and the CPFF expired in late 2009 and early 2010,
    respectively. During the period of its existence, the Company
    made limited use of the CPFF, and no amounts were outstanding
    under the CPFF at December 31, 2009.

In February 2009, the Treasury Department outlined a financial
    stability plan with additional measures to provide capital
    relief to institutions holding troubled assets, including a
    capital assistance program for banks that have undergone a
    “stress test” (the “Capital Assistance
    Program”) and a public-private investment fund to purchase
    troubled assets from financial institutions. MetLife was
    eligible to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s Capital
    Purchase Program, a voluntary capital infusion program
    established under EESA, but elected not to participate in that
    program. MetLife took part in the “stress test” and
    was advised by the Federal Reserve in May 2009 that, based on
    the stress test’s economic scenarios and methodology,
    MetLife had adequate capital to sustain a further deterioration
    in the economy. In January 2011, MetLife submitted to the
    Federal Reserve a comprehensive capital plan, as mandated by the
    Federal Reserve for the same bank holding companies that
    completed the 2009 stress test. The capital plan projects
    MetLife’s capital levels to the end of 2012 under baseline
    and stress scenarios. The Federal Reserve has stated that it
    will consider the results of the capital plan exercise in
    evaluating proposed capital actions by participating bank
    holding companies, such as common stock dividend increases and
    stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it
    will provide its assessment of participating institutions’
    capital plans in late March 2011.

State
    Insurance Regulatory Responses

The NAIC adopted a number of reserve and capital relief
    proposals during 2009. The NAIC revisited many of those
    adoptions and studied related and additional topics for
    potential adoption during 2010.

The NAIC revisited the mortgage experience adjustment factor
    (the “MEAF”) which is utilized in calculating RBC
    charges that are assigned to commercial and agricultural
    mortgages held by our domestic insurers. The MEAF calculation
    includes the ratio of an insurer’s commercial and
    agricultural mortgage default experience to the industry average
    commercial and agricultural mortgage default experience and, in
    2009, a cap of 125% and a floor



of 75% were adopted. The NAIC adopted during 2010 a cap of 175%
    and a floor of 80%. As a result of this revision in MEAF for
    2010, the RBC impact on our U.S. insurance subsidiaries is
    not likely to be material.

In late 2009, the NAIC issued Statement of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“SSAP”) 10R (“SSAP 10R”). SSAP
    10R increased the amount of deferred tax assets that may be
    admitted on a statutory basis. The admission criteria for
    realizing the value of deferred tax assets was increased from a
    one year to a three year period. Further, the aggregate cap on
    deferred tax assets that may be admitted was increased from 10%
    to 15% of surplus. These changes increased the capital and
    surplus of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, thereby
    positively impacting RBC at December 31, 2009. To temper
    this positive RBC impact, and as a temporary measure at
    December 31, 2009 only, a 5% pre-tax RBC charge must be
    applied to the additional admitted deferred tax assets generated
    by SSAP 10R. The adoption for 2009 had a December 31, 2009
    sunset; however, during 2010, the 2009 adoption, including the
    5% pre-tax RBC charge, was extended through December 31,
    2011.

In late 2009, following rating agency downgrades of virtually
    all residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”)
    from certain vintages, the NAIC engaged PIMCO Advisory
    (“PIMCO”), a provider of investment advisory services,
    to analyze approximately 20,000 RMBS held by insurers and
    evaluate the likely loss that holders of those securities would
    suffer in the event of a default. PIMCO’s analysis showed
    that the severity of expected losses on those securities
    evaluated that are held by our U.S. insurance companies was
    significantly less than would be implied by the rating
    agencies’ ratings of such securities. The NAIC incorporated
    the results of PIMCO’s analysis into the RBC charges
    assigned to the evaluated securities, with a beneficial impact
    on the RBC of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC
    utilized the solution again for 2010. The NAIC adopted a similar
    solution for 2010 for commercial mortgage-backed securities
    (“CMBS”) by selecting BlackRock Solutions, a provider
    of investment advisory services, to assist in the RBC
    determination process. BlackRock Solutions will serve as a
    third-party modeler of the 7,000 CMBS holdings of
    U.S. insurance companies, including MetLife’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries. The impact of the
    implementation for 2010 of the modeling solution for CMBS is not
    known at the current time but the RBC impact on our
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is not expected to be material.

Foreign
    Governmental and Intergovernmental Responses

In an effort to strengthen the financial condition of key
    financial institutions or avert their collapse, and to forestall
    or reduce the effects of reduced lending activity, a number of
    foreign governments and intergovernmental entities have taken
    action to enhance stability and liquidity, reduce risk and
    increase regulatory controls and oversight. Foreign government
    and intergovernmental responses have been similar to some of
    those taken by the U.S. Federal government, including
    injecting capital into domestic financial institutions in
    exchange for ownership stakes and, in the case of certain
    European Union member states such as Greece, Spain, Portugal and
    Ireland, providing or making available certain funds and rescue
    packages to support the solvency of such countries or financial
    institutions, and such responses are intended to achieve similar
    goals. We cannot predict whether foreign government

and/or

intergovernmental actions will achieve their intended purpose or
    how such actions will impact competition in the financial
    services industry. We expect the scope and extent of regulation
    outside the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to
    continue to increase. That oversight, and the legal and
    regulatory environment in the countries in which the Company
    operates, could have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s results of operations.

Competition

We believe that competition faced by our segments is based on a
    number of factors, including service, product features, scale,
    price, financial strength, claims-paying ratings, credit
    ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurance companies, as well as non-insurance
    financial services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and
    asset managers, for individual consumers, employer and other
    group customers as well as agents and other distributors of
    insurance and investment products. Some of these companies offer
    a broader array of products, have more competitive pricing or,
    with respect to other insurance companies, have higher claims
    paying ability ratings. Many of our insurance products are
    underwritten annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that
    group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from
    competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.



We believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began
    in the second half of 2007, its impact on the capital position
    of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and
    rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In
    particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted
    financial strength as the most significant differentiator from
    the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We
    believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this
    environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its
    individual products through other financial institutions such as
    banks and broker-dealers. These distribution partners are
    currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of
    the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial
    market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the risk
    associated with certain variable annuity products and has led
    many companies in our industry to re-examine the pricing and
    features of the products they offer. The effects of current
    market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life
    insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate
    impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest
    companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the
    current circumstances.

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurance companies for sales
    representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other
    insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the
    basis of our financial position, support services and
    compensation and product features. See
    “— U.S. Business — Sales
    Distribution.” In the U.S. and selected international
    markets, we continue to undertake several initiatives to grow
    our career agency force, while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial position could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents. See “Risk Factors — We May Be Unable to
    Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our Products.”

Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation.
    Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory
    environment can affect our competitive position within the life
    insurance industry and within the broader financial services
    industry. See “— U.S. Regulation,”
    “— International Regulation,” “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth” and “Risk Factors — Changes in
    U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and
    State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity
    Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability.”

Employees

At December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    66,000 employees. We believe that our relations with our
    employees are satisfactory.

Risk
    Factors

Difficult
    Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy
    Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and
    Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in
    the Near Future

Our business and results of operations are materially affected
    by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy
    generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.
    Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global
    capital markets or in particular markets or financial asset
    classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we
    have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities
    are sensitive to changing market factors. Disruptions in one
    market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset
    classes. Although the disruption in the global financial markets
    that began in late 2007 has moderated, not all global financial
    markets are functioning normally, and some remain reliant upon
    government intervention and liquidity. Upheavals in the
    financial markets can also affect our business through their
    effects on general levels of economic activity, employment and
    customer behavior. Although the recent recession in the U.S.
    ended in June of 2009, the recovery from the recession has been
    below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to
    remain high for some time. In addition, inflation is expected to
    remain at low levels for some time. Some economists believe that
    some level of disinflation and deflation risk remains in the
    U.S. economy. The global recession and disruption of the
    financial markets has led to concerns over capital markets
    access and the solvency of certain European Union member states,
    including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. The
    Japanese economy, to which we face increased exposure as a
    result of the Acquisition, continues to experience low nominal
    growth, a deflationary environment, and weak consumer spending.

Our revenues and net investment income are likely to remain
    under pressure in such circumstances and our profit margins
    could erode. Also, in the event of extreme prolonged market
    events, such as the recent global credit crisis, we could incur
    significant capital

and/or

operating losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we
    are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.

We are a significant writer of variable annuity products. The
    account values of these products decrease as a result of
    downturns in capital markets. Decreases in account values reduce
    the fees generated by our variable annuity products, cause the
    amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
    (“DAC”) to accelerate and could increase the level of
    insurance liabilities we must carry to support those variable
    annuities issued with any associated guarantees.

Factors such as consumer spending, business investment,
    government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital
    markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic
    environment and, ultimately, the amount and



profitability of our business. In an economic downturn
    characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower
    corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer
    spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products
    could be adversely affected. Group insurance, in particular, is
    affected by the higher unemployment rate. In addition, we may
    experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or
    surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer
    paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums
    altogether. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings
    negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition. The
    recent market turmoil has precipitated, and may continue to
    raise the possibility of, legislative, regulatory and
    governmental actions. We cannot predict whether or when such
    actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could
    have on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition. See “— Actions of the
    U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other
    Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and
    Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended
    Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive
    Position,” “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank
    Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” “— Our
    Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Heavily
    Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability.”

Adverse
    Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect
    Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Access to Capital and Cost
    of Capital

The capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods
    of extreme volatility and disruption. Such volatility and
    disruption could cause liquidity and credit capacity for certain
    issuers to be limited.

We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our
    debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities
    lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities.
    Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our
    operations, and our business will suffer. The principal sources
    of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations,
    deposit funds, and cash flow from our investment portfolio and
    assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily
    convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets
    also include short-term instruments such as funding agreements
    and commercial paper. Sources of capital in normal markets
    include long-term instruments, medium- and long-term debt,
    junior subordinated debt securities, capital securities and
    equity securities.

In the event market or other conditions have an adverse impact
    on our capital and liquidity beyond expectations and our current
    resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek
    additional financing. The availability of additional financing
    will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions,
    regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit,
    the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of
    credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings
    and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers
    or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or
    short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment
    losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to
    a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be
    impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take
    negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity
    may prove to be insufficient and, in such case, we may not be
    able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable
    terms, or at all.

Our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we
    are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on
    short notice under securities lending agreements.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit
    markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate
    our business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such
    market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely
    manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy regulatory capital
    requirements (under both insurance and banking laws); and access
    the capital necessary to grow our business. See
    “Business — U.S. Regulation —
    Financial Holding Company Regulation” for information
    relating to the possible impact of Basel II and
    Basel III on the Company. As such, we may be forced to
    delay raising capital, issue different types of securities than
    we would otherwise, less effectively deploy such capital, issue
    shorter tenor securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive
    cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and
    significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of
    operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory
    capital position could be materially adversely affected by
    disruptions in the financial markets.



Actions
    of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
    Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and
    Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended
    Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive
    Position

In recent years, Congress, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
    the FDIC, the U.S. Treasury and other agencies of the
    U.S. federal government took a number of increasingly
    aggressive actions (in addition to continuing a series of
    interest rate reductions that began in the second half of
    2007) intended to provide liquidity to financial
    institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor confidence
    in particular troubled institutions, to prevent or contain the
    spread of the financial crisis and to spur economic growth. Most
    of these programs have largely run their course or been
    discontinued. More likely to be relevant to MetLife, Inc. is the
    monetary policy implemented by the Federal Reserve Board, as
    well as Dodd-Frank, which will significantly change financial
    regulation in the U.S. in a number of areas that could
    affect MetLife. Given the large number of provisions that must
    be implemented through regulatory action, we cannot predict what
    impact this could have on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition.

It is not certain what effect the enactment of Dodd-Frank will
    have on the financial markets, the availability of credit, asset
    prices and MetLife’s operations. See
    “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our
    Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth.” In addition, the U.S. federal
    government (including the FDIC) and private lenders have
    instituted programs to reduce the monthly payment obligations of
    mortgagors

and/or

reduce the principal payable on residential mortgage loans. As a
    result of such programs or of any legislation requiring loan
    modifications, we may need to maintain or increase our
    engagement in similar activities in order to comply with program
    or statutory requirements and to remain competitive. We cannot
    predict whether the funds made available by the
    U.S. federal government and its agencies will be enough to
    continue stabilizing or to further revive the financial markets
    or, if additional amounts are necessary, whether the Federal
    Reserve Board will make funds available, whether Congress will
    be willing to make the necessary appropriations, what the
    public’s sentiment would be towards any such
    appropriations, or what additional requirements or conditions
    might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds.

The choices made by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve
    Board and the FDIC in their distribution of funds under EESA and
    any future asset purchase programs, as well as any decisions
    made regarding the imposition of additional regulation on large
    financial institutions may have, over time, the effect of
    supporting or burdening some aspects of the financial services
    industry more than others. Some of our competitors have
    received, or may in the future receive, benefits under one or
    more of the federal government’s programs. This could
    adversely affect our competitive position. See
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability.” See also
    “— New and Impending Compensation and Corporate
    Governance Regulations Could Hinder or Prevent Us From
    Attracting and Retaining Management and Other Employees with the
    Talent and Experience to Manage and Conduct Our Business
    Effectively” and “— Our Insurance, Brokerage
    and Banking Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.”

Our
    Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Heavily
    Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth

Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of
    insurance and other laws and regulations. See
    “Business — U.S. Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation.” State insurance laws regulate most
    aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance
    subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the
    states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they
    are licensed. Our

non-U.S. insurance

operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory
    authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or
    operate. See “Business — International
    Regulation.”

State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities
    broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with
    statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;



•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through
    the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices,
    distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;

•

regulating advertising;

•

protecting privacy;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and
    solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and
    minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance
    policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions
    between affiliates; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess
    insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
    policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an
    assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have
    currently established for these potential liabilities may not be
    adequate. See “Business —
    U.S. Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.”

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly reexamine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies
    and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly
    regulate the business of insurance. However,

Dodd-Frank

allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators
    to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if
    the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. It
    also establishes the Federal Insurance Office which has the
    authority to participate in the negotiations of international
    insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S. The
    Federal Insurance Office also is authorized to collect
    information about the insurance industry and recommend
    prudential standards.

Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas
    can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies.
    These areas include financial services regulation, securities
    regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy,
    tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms
    of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been
    proposed from time to time, including proposals for the
    establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance
    companies. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also
    be affected by Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes new
    restrictions on the ability of affiliates of insured depository
    institutions (such as MetLife Bank) to engage in proprietary
    trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity
    funds. See “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could
    Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is
    subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and
    guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the
    business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as
    well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC, the
    Federal Reserve and the FDIC.

Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of
    MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to,
    among other things:

•

chartering to carry on business as a bank;

•

the permissibility of certain activities;

•

maintaining minimum capital ratios;



•

capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;

•

dividend payments;

•

safety and soundness standards;

•

loan loss and other related liabilities;

•

liquidity;

•

financial reporting and disclosure standards;

•

counterparty credit concentration;

•

restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;

•

lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit
    exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within
    lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);

•

payment of interest;

•

unfair or deceptive acts or practices;

•

privacy; and

•

bank holding company and bank change of control.

Federal and state banking regulators regularly re-examine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their
    products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on the financial condition and results
    of operations of MetLife Bank.

In addition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new Bureau of Consumer
    Financial Protection that supervises and regulates institutions
    providing certain financial products and services to consumers.
    Although the consumer financial services to which this
    legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in
    which we engage, the new Bureau has authority to regulate
    consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance
    consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife.
    Dodd-Frank established a statutory standard for Federal
    pre-emption of state consumer financial protection laws, which
    standard will require national banks to comply with many state
    consumer financial protection laws that previously were
    considered preempted by Federal law. As a result, the regulatory
    and compliance burden on MetLife Bank may increase and could
    adversely affect its business and results of operations.
    Dodd-Frank also includes provisions on mortgage lending,
    anti-predatory lending and other regulatory and supervisory
    provisions that could impact the business and operations of
    MetLife Bank.

Dodd-Frank also authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of
    conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing
    personalized investment advice to retail and other customers.
    This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of
    the customer without regard to the financial or other interest
    of the broker or dealer providing the advice. See
    “Business — U.S. Regulation —
    Banking Regulation” and “— Changes in
    U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and
    State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity
    Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability.”

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
    published Basel III for banks and bank holding companies,
    such as MetLife, Inc. Assuming regulators in the U.S. endorse
    and adopt Basel III, it will require banks and bank holding
    companies to hold greater amounts of capital, to comply with
    requirements for short-term liquidity and to reduce reliance on
    short-term funding sources. See “Business —
    U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company
    Regulation — Capital” and “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Industry Trends — Financial and
    Economic Environment.” It is not clear how these new
    requirements will compare to the enhanced prudential standards
    that may apply to us under Dodd-Frank. See
    “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our
    Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth.”



As a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s ability to pay
    dividends may be restricted by the Federal Reserve Bank of
    New York. In addition, the ability of MetLife Bank and
    MetLife, Inc. to pay dividends could be restricted by any
    additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a
    result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank

and/or

the
    endorsement and adoption by the U.S. of Basel III.

The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors.
    Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our
    control, the liabilities that we have currently established for
    these potential liabilities may not be adequate. In addition,
    Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessment for banks with
    assets of $10.0 billion or more, which includes MetLife
    Bank.

Our international operations are subject to regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate, as described further under
    “Business — International Regulation.” A
    significant portion of our revenues are generated through
    operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in
    early stages of economic and political development. Our
    international operations may be materially adversely affected by
    foreign authorities and regulators, such as through
    nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of
    limits on foreign ownership, changes in laws or their
    interpretation or application, political instability, dividend
    limitations, price controls, currency exchange controls or other
    restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these
    operations out of the countries in which they operate or
    converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or
    other currencies, as well as adverse actions by foreign
    governmental authorities and regulators. This may also impact
    many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries.
    Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may
    affect our business relationships with them and their ability to
    purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Our international operations are subject to local laws and
    regulations, and we expect the scope and extent of regulation
    outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally
    to continue to increase. The authority of our international
    operations to conduct business is subject to licensing
    requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations
    are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory
    environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in
    laws could have a material adverse effect on us and our foreign
    operations. See “— Our International Operations
    Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including
    Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, that Could
    Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability”
    and “Business — International Regulation.”

Furthermore, the increase in our international operations as a
    result of the acquisition of ALICO may also subject us to
    increased supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, since the
    size of a bank holding company’s foreign activities is
    taken as an indication of the holding company’s complexity.
    It may also have an effect on the manner in which MetLife, Inc.
    is required to calculate its RBC.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
    consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
    regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect
    compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations
    or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s regulated subsidiaries that
    could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We
    cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken
    that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the
    interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and
    statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in
    areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.

We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future
    become subject to additional regulations. See
    “Business — U.S. Regulation” and
    “Business — International Regulation.”



Various
    Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations,
    Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed Dodd-Frank.
    Various provisions of Dodd-Frank could affect our business
    operations and our profitability and limit our growth. For
    example:

•

As a large, interconnected bank holding company with assets of
    $50 billion or more, or possibly as an otherwise
    systemically important financial company, MetLife, Inc. will be
    subject to enhanced prudential standards imposed on systemically
    significant financial companies. Enhanced standards will be
    applied to RBC, liquidity, leverage (unless another, similar,
    standard is appropriate), resolution plan and credit exposure
    reporting, concentration limits, and risk management.
    Off-balance sheet activities are required to be accounted for in
    meeting capital requirements. In addition, if it were determined
    that MetLife posed a substantial threat to U.S. financial
    stability, the applicable federal regulators would have the
    right to require it to take one or more other mitigating actions
    to reduce that risk, including limiting its ability to merge
    with or acquire another company, terminating activities,
    restricting its ability to offer financial products or requiring
    it to sell assets or off-balance sheet items to unaffiliated
    entities. Enhanced standards would also permit, but not require,
    regulators to establish requirements with respect to contingent
    capital, enhanced public disclosures and short-term debt limits.
    These standards are described as being more stringent than those
    otherwise imposed on bank holding companies; however, the
    Federal Reserve Board is permitted to apply them on an

institution-by-institution

basis, depending on its determination of the institution’s
    riskiness. In addition, under Dodd-Frank, all bank holding
    companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding
    companies, such as MetLife, Inc. will be required to be
    “well capitalized” and “well managed” as
    defined by the Federal Reserve Board, on a consolidated basis
    and not just at their depository institution(s), a higher
    standard than was applicable to financial holding companies
    before

Dodd-Frank.

•

MetLife, Inc., as a bank holding company, will have to meet
    minimum leverage ratio and RBC requirements on a consolidated
    basis to be established by the Federal Reserve Board that are
    not less than those applicable to insured depository
    institutions under so-called prompt corrective action
    regulations as in effect on the date of the enactment of
    Dodd-Frank. One consequence of these new rules will ultimately
    be the inability of bank holding companies to include
    trust-preferred securities as part of their Tier 1 capital.
    Because of the phase-in period for these new rules, they should
    have little practical effect on MetLife’s ability to treat
    its currently outstanding trust-preferred securities as part of
    its Tier 1 capital, but they do prevent MetLife, Inc. from
    treating the common equity units issued as part of the
    consideration for the Acquisition as Tier I capital, since
    the new rules apply immediately to instruments issued after
    May 19, 2010.

•

Under the provisions of Dodd-Frank relating to the resolution or
    liquidation of certain types of financial institutions,
    including bank holding companies, if MetLife, Inc. were to
    become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its
    obligations, it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with
    the FDIC as receiver. For this new regime to be applicable, a
    number of determinations would have to be made, including that a
    default by the affected company would have serious adverse
    effects on financial stability in the U.S. If the FDIC were to
    be appointed as the receiver for such a company, the liquidation
    of that company would occur under the provisions of the new
    liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code. In
    such a liquidation, the holders of such company’s debt
    could in certain a respects be treated differently than under
    the Bankruptcy Code. In particular, unsecured creditors and
    shareholders are intended to bear the losses of the company
    being liquidated. The FDIC is authorized to establish rules for
    the priority of creditors’ claims and, under certain
    circumstances, to treat similarly situated creditors
    differently. These provisions could apply to some financial
    institutions whose outstanding debt securities we hold in our
    investment portfolios. Dodd-Frank also provides for the
    assessment of bank holding companies with assets of
    $50.0 billion or more, non-bank financial companies
    supervised by the Federal Reserve Bank, and other financial
    companies with assets of $50.0 billion or more to cover the
    costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new
    liquidation authority. Although it is not possible to assess the
    full impact of the liquidation authority at this time, it could
    affect the funding costs of large bank holding companies or
    financial companies that might be viewed as systemically
    significant. It could also lead to an increase in secured
    financings.

•

Dodd-Frank also includes a new framework of regulation of the
    OTC derivatives markets which will require clearing of certain
    types of transactions currently traded OTC and could potentially
    impose additional costs,



including new capital, reporting and margin requirements and
    additional regulation on the Company. Increased margin
    requirements on MetLife, Inc.’s part and a smaller universe
    of securities that will qualify as eligible collateral could
    reduce its liquidity and require an increase in its holdings of
    cash and government securities with lower yields causing a
    reduction in income. However, increased margin requirements and
    the expanded ability to transfer trades between MetLife,
    Inc.’s counterparties could reduce MetLife, Inc.’s
    exposure to its counterparties’ default. MetLife, Inc. uses
    derivatives to mitigate a wide range of risks in connection with
    its businesses, including the impact of increased benefit
    exposures from our annuity products that offer guaranteed
    benefits. The derivative clearing requirements of

Dodd-Frank

could increase the cost of our risk mitigation and expose us to
    the risk of a default by a clearinghouse or one of its members.
    In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other
    management procedures prove ineffective in reducing the risks to
    which insurance policies expose us or that unanticipated
    policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market
    events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk
    management techniques employed. Any such losses could be
    increased by any higher costs of writing derivatives (including
    customized derivatives) that might result from the enactment of
    Dodd-Frank.

•

Dodd-Frank restricts the ability of insured depository
    institutions and of companies, such as MetLife, Inc., that
    control an insured depository institution and their affiliates,
    to engage in proprietary trading and to sponsor or invest in
    funds (hedge funds and private equity funds) that rely on
    certain exemptions from the Investment Company Act. Dodd-Frank
    provides an exemption for investment activity by a regulated
    insurance company or its affiliate solely for the general
    account of such insurance company if such activity is in
    compliance with the insurance company investments laws of the
    state or jurisdiction in which such company is domiciled and the
    appropriate Federal regulators after consultation with relevant
    insurance commissioners have not jointly determined such laws to
    be insufficient to protect the safety and soundness of the
    institution or the financial stability of the U.S.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the appropriate Federal
    regulatory authorities are permitted under the legislation to
    impose, as part of rulemaking, additional capital requirements
    and other restrictions on any exempted activity. Dodd-Frank
    provides for a period of study and rule making during which the
    effects of the statutory language may be clarified. Among other
    considerations, the study is to assess and include
    recommendations so as to appropriately accommodate the business
    of insurance within an insurance company subject to regulation
    in accordance with relevant insurance company investments laws.
    While these provisions of Dodd-Frank are supposed to accommodate
    the business of insurance, until the related study and
    rulemaking are complete, it is unclear whether MetLife, Inc. may
    have to alter any of its future investment activities to comply.

•

Until various studies are completed and final regulations are
    promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the full impact of
    Dodd-Frank on the investments and investment activities and
    insurance and annuity products of MetLife, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries remains unclear. For example, besides directly
    limiting our future investment activities, Dodd-Frank could
    potentially negatively impact the market for, the returns from,
    or liquidity in, primary and secondary investments in private
    equity funds and hedge funds that are connected to (either
    through a fund sponsorship or investor relationship) an insured
    depository institution. The number of sponsors of such funds
    going forward may diminish, which may impact our available fund
    investment opportunities. Although Dodd-Frank provides for
    various transition periods for coming into compliance, fund
    sponsors that are subject to Dodd-Frank, and whose funds we have
    invested in, may have to spin off their funds business or reduce
    their ownership stakes in their funds, thereby potentially
    impacting our related investments in such funds. In addition,
    should such funds be required or choose to liquidate or sell
    their underlying assets, the market value and liquidity of such
    assets or the broader related asset classes could negatively be
    affected, including securities and real estate assets that
    MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries hold or may plan to sell.
    Secondary sales of fund interests at significant discounts by
    banking institutions and their affiliates, which are not fund
    sponsors but nevertheless are subject to the divestment
    requirements of

Dodd-Frank,

could reduce the returns realized by investors such as MetLife,
    Inc. and its subsidiaries seeking to access liquidity by selling
    their fund interests. In addition, our existing derivatives
    counterparties and the financial institutions subject to
    Dodd-Frank in which we have invested also could be negatively
    impacted by Dodd-Frank. See also “— New and
    Impending Compensation and Corporate Governance Regulations
    Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining
    Management and Other Employees with the Talent and Experience to
    Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively.”



•

In addition, Dodd-Frank statutorily imposes the requirement that
    MetLife, Inc. serve as a source of strength for MetLife Bank.

The addition of a new regulatory regime over MetLife, Inc. and
    its subsidiaries, the likelihood of additional regulations, and
    the other changes discussed above could require changes to
    MetLife, Inc.’s operations. Whether such changes would
    affect our competitiveness in comparison to other institutions
    is uncertain, since it is possible that at least some of our
    competitors, for example insurance holding companies that
    control thrifts, rather than banks, will be similarly affected.
    Competitive effects are possible, however, if MetLife, Inc. were
    required to pay any new or increased assessments and capital
    requirements are imposed, and to the extent any new prudential
    supervisory standards are imposed on MetLife, Inc. but not on
    its competitors. We cannot predict whether other proposals will
    be adopted, or what impact, if any, the adoption of Dodd-Frank
    or other proposals and the resulting studies and regulations
    could have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations or on our dealings with other financial companies.
    See also “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May
    Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and
    “— New and Impending Compensation and Corporate
    Governance Regulations Could Hinder or Prevent Us From
    Attracting and Retaining Management and Other Employees with the
    Talent and Experience to Manage and Conduct Our Business
    Effectively.”

Moreover, Dodd-Frank potentially affects such a wide range of
    the activities and markets in which MetLife, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries engage and participate that it may not be possible
    to anticipate all of the ways in which it could affect us. For
    example, many of our methods for managing risk and exposures are
    based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or
    statistics based on historical models. Historical market
    behavior may be altered by the enactment of Dodd-Frank. As a
    result of this enactment and otherwise, these methods may not
    fully predict future exposures, which could be significantly
    greater than our historical measures indicate.

The
    Resolution of Several Issues Affecting the Financial Services
    Industry Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Reported Results or
    on Our Relations with Current and Potential
    Customers

We will continue to be subject to legal and regulatory actions
    in the ordinary course of our business, both in the U.S. and
    internationally. This could result in a review of business sold
    in the past under previously acceptable market practices at the
    time. Regulators are increasingly interested in the approach
    that product providers use to select third-party distributors
    and to monitor the appropriateness of sales made by them. In
    some cases, product providers can be held responsible for the
    deficiencies of third-party distributors.

As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of
    industry abuses, there have been numerous regulatory inquiries
    and proposals for legislative and regulatory reforms.

In Asia, where MetLife derives and will continue to derive a
    significant portion of its income, regulatory regimes are
    developing at different speeds, driven by a combination of
    global factors and local considerations. New requirements may be
    introduced that are retrospectively applied to sales made prior
    to their introduction.

We Are
    Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which
    May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial
    Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income
    to Vary from Period to Period

We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets
    risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange
    rates, market volatility, the performance of the global economy
    in general, the performance of the specific obligors, including
    governments, included in our portfolio and other factors outside
    our control.

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the
    market price and cash flow variability associated with changes
    in interest rates. Changes in interest rates will impact the net
    unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income investment
    portfolio. If long-term interest rates rise dramatically within
    a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life insurance
    businesses and fixed annuity business may be exposed to
    disintermediation risk. Disintermediation risk refers to the
    risk that our policyholders may surrender their contracts in a
    rising interest rate environment, requiring us to liquidate
    fixed income investments in an unrealized loss position. Due to
    the long-term



nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our life
    insurance businesses, guaranteed benefits on variable annuities,
    and structured settlements, sustained declines in long-term
    interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and
    increased hedging costs. In other situations, declines in
    interest rates may result in increasing the duration of certain
    life insurance liabilities, creating asset-liability duration
    mismatches.

Our investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive
    instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be
    adversely affected by changes in interest rates from
    governmental monetary policies, domestic and international
    economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our
    control. Changes in interest rates will impact both the net
    unrealized gain or loss position of our fixed income portfolio
    and the rates of return we receive on funds invested. Our
    mitigation efforts with respect to interest rate risk are
    primarily focused towards maintaining an investment portfolio
    with diversified maturities that has a weighted average duration
    that is approximately equal to the duration of our estimated
    liability cash flow profile. However, our estimate of the
    liability cash flow profile may be inaccurate and we may be
    forced to liquidate fixed income investments prior to maturity
    at a loss in order to cover the cash flow profile of the
    liability. Although we take measures to manage the economic
    risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we
    may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our fixed
    income investments relative to our liabilities. See also
    “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price
    volatility and cash flow variability associated with changes in
    credit spreads. A widening of credit spreads will adversely
    impact both the net unrealized gain or loss position of the
    fixed-income investment portfolio, will increase losses
    associated with credit-based non-qualifying derivatives where we
    assume credit exposure, and, if issuer credit spreads increase
    significantly or for an extended period of time, will likely
    result in higher

other-than-temporary

impairments. Credit spread tightening will reduce net investment
    income associated with new purchases of fixed maturity
    securities. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult
    to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less
    frequent. As such, valuations may include assumptions or
    estimates that may have significant period to period changes
    which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition. Credit spreads on both
    corporate and structured securities widened significantly during
    2008, resulting in continuing depressed pricing. As a result of
    improved conditions, credit spreads narrowed in 2009 and changed
    to a lesser extent in 2010. If there is a resumption of
    significant volatility in the markets, it could cause changes in
    credit spreads and defaults and a lack of pricing transparency
    which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, financial condition,
    liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses,
    impairments, and changes in unrealized loss positions.

Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for
    lower earnings associated with certain of our insurance
    businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated
    fair value of the assets under management. Downturns and
    volatility in equity markets can have a material adverse effect
    on the revenues and investment returns from our savings and
    investment products and services. Because these products and
    services generate fees related primarily to the value of assets
    under management, a decline in the equity markets could reduce
    our revenues from the reduction in the value of the investments
    we manage. The retail variable annuity business in particular is
    highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness in
    the equity markets could decrease revenues and earnings in
    variable annuity products. Furthermore, certain of our variable
    annuity products offer guaranteed benefits which increase our
    potential benefit exposure should equity markets decline.
    MetLife, Inc. uses derivatives and reinsurance to mitigate the
    impact of such increased potential benefit exposures. We are
    also exposed to interest rate and equity risk based upon the
    discount rate and expected long-term rate of return assumptions
    associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit
    obligations. Sustained declines in long-term interest rates or
    equity returns likely would have a negative effect on the funded
    status of these plans. Lastly, we invest a portion of our
    investments in public and private equity securities, leveraged
    buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds and
    the estimated fair value of such investments may be impacted by
    downturns or volatility in equity markets.

Our primary exposure to real estate risk relates to commercial
    and agricultural real estate. Our exposure to commercial and
    agricultural real estate risk stems from various factors. These
    factors include, but are not limited to, market conditions
    including the demand and supply of leasable commercial space,
    creditworthiness of tenants and partners, capital markets
    volatility and the inherent interest rate movement. In addition,
    our real estate joint venture development program is subject to
    risks, including, but not limited to, reduced property sales and
    decreased availability of financing which could adversely impact
    the joint venture developments

and/or

operations. The state of the economy



and speed of recovery in fundamental and capital market
    conditions in the commercial and agricultural real estate
    sectors will continue to influence the performance of our
    investments in these sectors. These factors and others beyond
    our control could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows
    through net investment income, realized investment losses and
    levels of valuation allowances.

Our investment portfolio contains investments in government
    bonds issued by European nations. Recently, the European Union
    member states have experienced above average public debt,
    inflation and unemployment as the global economic downturn has
    developed. A number of member states are significantly impacted
    by the economies of their more influential neighbors, such as
    Germany. In addition, financial troubles of one nation can
    trigger a domino effect on others. In particular, a number of
    large European banks hold significant amounts of sovereign
    financial institution debt of other European nations and could
    experience difficulties as a result of defaults or declines in
    the value of such debt. Our investment portfolio also contains
    investments in revenue bonds issued under the auspices of
    U.S. states and municipalities and a limited amount of
    general obligation bonds of U.S. states and municipalities
    (collectively, “Municipal Bonds”). Recently, certain
    U.S. states and municipalities have faced budget deficits
    and financial difficulties. There can be no assurance that the
    financial difficulties of such U.S. states and
    municipalities would not have an adverse impact on our Municipal
    Bond portfolio.

Our primary foreign currency exchange risks are described under
    “— Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability.” Changes
    in these factors, which are significant risks to us, can affect
    our net investment income in any period, and such changes can be
    substantial.

A portion of our investments are made in leveraged buy-out
    funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds, many of which
    make private equity investments. The amount and timing of net
    investment income from such investment funds tends to be uneven
    as a result of the performance of the underlying investments,
    including private equity investments. The timing of
    distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events
    relating to the underlying investments, as well as the
    funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs
    for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount
    of net investment income that we record from these investments
    can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Recovering
    private equity markets and stabilizing credit and real estate
    markets during 2010 had a positive impact on returns and net
    investment income on private equity funds, hedge funds and real
    estate joint ventures, which are included within other limited
    partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint
    venture portfolios. Although volatility in most global financial
    markets has moderated, if there is a resumption of significant
    volatility, it could adversely impact returns and net investment
    income on these alternative investment classes.

Continuing challenges include continued weakness in the
    U.S. real estate market and increased residential mortgage
    loan and other consumer loan delinquencies, investor anxiety
    over the U.S. and European economies, rating agency
    downgrades of various structured products and financial issuers,
    unresolved issues with structured investment vehicles and
    monoline financial guarantee insurers, deleveraging of financial
    institutions and hedge funds and the continuing recovery in the
    inter-bank market. If there is a resumption of significant
    volatility in the markets, it could cause changes in interest
    rates, declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or
    weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar
    which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations, financial condition,
    liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses,
    impairments, increased valuation allowances and changes in
    unrealized gain or loss positions.

Changes
    in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability

Some of our products, principally traditional whole life
    insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts,
    expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce
    our investment margin or “spread,” or the difference
    between the amounts that we are required to pay under the
    contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are
    able to earn on general account investments intended to support
    obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component
    of our net income.

As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be
    forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured
    or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our
    investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the
    fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage
    loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio
    with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates,
    which exacerbates this risk.



Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in
    investment margins on some products. However, our ability to
    lower these rates could be limited by competition or
    contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the
    timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our
    spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our
    expectation for future spreads is an important component in the
    amortization of DAC and value of business acquired
    (“VOBA”), and significantly lower spreads may cause us
    to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the
    affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of
    declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products
    may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers,
    resulting in increased premium payments on products with
    flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and
    increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance
    policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period
    when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in
    market interest rates could also reduce our return on
    investments that do not support particular policy obligations.
    Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially affect our
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows and
    significantly reduce our profitability. We recognize that a low
    interest rate environment will adversely affect our earnings,
    but we do not believe any such impact will be material in 2011.

The sufficiency of our life insurance statutory reserves in
    Taiwan is highly sensitive to interest rates and other related
    assumptions. This is due to the sustained low interest rate
    environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate
    guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health
    contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of
    long-duration investments in the Taiwanese capital markets to
    match such long-duration liabilities. The key assumptions
    include current Taiwan government bond yield rates increasing
    approximately 1% from current levels over the next ten years,
    lapse rates, mortality and morbidity levels remaining consistent
    with recent experience, and U.S. dollar-denominated
    investments making up to 35% of total assets backing life
    insurance statutory reserves. Current reserve adequacy analysis
    shows that provisions are adequate; however, adverse changes in
    key assumptions for interest rates, lapse experience and
    mortality and morbidity levels could lead to a need to
    strengthen reserves.

Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect
    our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest
    rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the
    investments in MetLife’s general account with higher
    yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates
    necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We,
    therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower
    profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of
    existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy
    loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as
    policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as
    interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows
    requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of
    those investments are adversely affected by the increase in
    market interest rates, which may result in realized investment
    losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us
    to accelerate the amortization of DAC, VOBA and negative VOBA,
    which reduces net income. An increase in market interest rates
    could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our
    investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated
    fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a
    substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Lastly, an
    increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income
    associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity
    account balances invested in fixed income funds.

Some
    of Our Investments Are Relatively Illiquid and Are in Asset
    Classes That Have Been Experiencing Significant Market
    Valuation Fluctuations

We hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as
    privately-placed fixed maturity securities; mortgage loans;
    policy loans and leveraged leases; equity real estate, including
    real estate joint ventures and funds; and other limited
    partnership interests. These asset classes represented 26.6% of
    the carrying value of our total cash and investments at
    December 31, 2010. In recent years, even some of our very
    high quality investments experienced reduced liquidity during
    periods of market volatility or disruption. If we require
    significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal
    cash requirements or are required to post or return cash
    collateral in connection with our investment portfolio,
    derivatives transactions or securities lending program, we may
    have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner, be
    forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been
    able to realize, or both. The reported value of our relatively
    illiquid types of investments, our investments in the asset
    classes described above and, at times, our high quality,
    generally liquid asset classes, do not necessarily reflect the
    lowest current market price for the asset. If we were forced to
    sell certain of our investments in the global market, there can
    be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices
    at which we have recorded them and we could be forced to sell
    them at significantly lower prices.



Our
    Participation in a Securities Lending Program Subjects Us to
    Potential Liquidity and Other Risks

We participate in a securities lending program whereby blocks of
    securities, which are included in fixed maturity securities and
    short-term investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily
    brokerage firms and commercial banks. We generally obtain
    collateral in an amount equal to 102% of the estimated fair
    value of the loaned securities, which is obtained at the
    inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or
    equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. Returns of loaned
    securities by the third parties would require us to return the
    collateral associated with such loaned securities. In addition,
    in some cases, the maturity of the securities held as invested
    collateral (i.e., securities that we have purchased with cash
    collateral received from the third parties) may exceed the term
    of the related securities on loan and the estimated fair value
    may fall below the amount of cash received as collateral and
    invested. If we are required to return significant amounts of
    cash collateral on short notice and we are forced to sell
    securities to meet the return obligation, we may have difficulty
    selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a
    timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a volatile or
    illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able
    to realize under normal market conditions, or both. In addition,
    under stressful capital market and economic conditions,
    liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further restrict our
    ability to sell securities. If we decrease the amount of our
    securities lending activities over time, the amount of net
    investment income generated by these activities will also likely
    decline. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments — Securities Lending.”

Our
    Requirements to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments Related to
    Declines in Estimated Fair Value of Specified Assets May
    Adversely Affect Our Liquidity and Expose Us to Counterparty
    Credit Risk

Some of our transactions with financial and other institutions
    specify the circumstances under which the parties are required
    to pledge collateral related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the specified assets. In addition, under the terms
    of some of our transactions, we may be required to make payments
    to our counterparties related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the specified assets. The amount of collateral we
    may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to
    make under these agreements may increase under certain
    circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Collateral Financing
    Arrangements” and Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross
    Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities May Be
    Realized or Result in Future Impairments, Resulting in a
    Reduction in Our Net Income

Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as

available-for-sale

are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or
    losses on

available-for-sale

securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from net income. Our
    gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities
    available for sale at December 31, 2010 were
    $6.9 billion. The portion of the $6.9 billion of gross
    unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities where
    the estimated fair value has declined and remained below
    amortized cost or cost by 20% or more for six months or greater
    was $2.1 billion at December 31, 2010. The accumulated
    change in estimated fair value of these

available-for-sale

securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is
    realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the
    decline in estimated fair value is determined to be

other-than-temporary

and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. Realized losses
    or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net
    income in a particular quarterly or annual period.

The
    Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken
    on Our Investments is Highly Subjective and Could Materially
    Impact Our Results of Operations or Financial
    Position

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments
    varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. We update our evaluations regularly and
    reflect changes in allowances and impairments in net investment
    losses as such evaluations are revised. Additional impairments
    may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future.
    Furthermore, historical trends may not be indicative of future
    impairments or allowances.



For example, the cost of our fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for impairments deemed to be

other-than-temporary.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on
    our

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The review of our fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value has declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value has declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.

Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the
    security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery. Inherent
    in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates
    about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings
    potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process
    include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and
    the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost
    or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of
    securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial
    difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an
    entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources; (vi) with respect to fixed
    maturity securities, whether we have the intent to sell or will
    more likely than not be required to sell a particular security
    before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below
    amortized cost; (vii) with respect to equity securities,
    whether we have the ability and intent to hold a particular
    security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount at least equal
    to its cost; (viii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash
    flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
    (“ABS”); and (ix) other subjective factors,
    including concentrations and information obtained from
    regulators and rating agencies.

Defaults
    on Our Mortgage Loans and Volatility in Performance May
    Adversely Affect Our Profitability

Our mortgage loans face default risk and are principally
    collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential
    properties. We establish valuation allowances for estimated
    impairments at the balance sheet date. Such valuation allowances
    are based on the excess carrying value of the loan over the
    present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
    loan’s original effective interest rate, the estimated fair
    value of the loan’s collateral if the loan is in the
    process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent, or the
    loan’s observable market price. We also establish valuation
    allowances for loan losses for pools of loans with similar risk
    characteristics, such as property types, or loans having similar

loan-to-value

ratios and debt service coverage ratios, when based on past
    experience, it is probable that a credit event has occurred and
    the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These
    valuation allowances are based on loan risk characteristics,
    historical default rates and loss severities, real estate market
    fundamentals and outlook as well as other relevant factors. At
    December 31, 2010, mortgage loans that were either
    delinquent or in the process of foreclosure totaled less than
    0.6% of our mortgage loan investments. The performance of our
    mortgage loan investments, however, may fluctuate in the future.
    In addition, substantially all of our mortgage loans

held-for-investment

have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate
    of our mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition through realized investment losses or increases in our
    valuation allowances.

Further, any geographic or sector concentration of our mortgage
    loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolios and
    consequently on our results of operations or financial
    condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a
    broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments that have
    a negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector
    may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios
    to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated. Moreover,
    our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of
    related assets may be limited if other market participants are
    seeking to sell at the same time. In addition, legislative
    proposals that would allow or require modifications to the terms
    of mortgage loans could be enacted. We cannot predict whether
    these proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such
    proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business
    or investments. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Investments — Mortgage
    Loans.”



The
    Impairment of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us

We have exposure to many different industries and
    counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry, including
    brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge
    funds and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of
    these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of
    default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to
    secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when
    the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
    prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
    derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these
    financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt
    instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities,
    derivative transactions, joint venture, hedge fund and equity
    investments. Further, potential action by governments and
    regulatory bodies in response to the financial crisis affecting
    the global banking system and financial markets, such as
    investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and
    other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or
    any new authority that may be created, could negatively impact
    these instruments, securities, transactions and investments.
    There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to
    the carrying value of these investments would not materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We
    Face Unforeseen Liabilities, Asset Impairments or Rating Actions
    Arising from Acquisitions, Including ALICO, and Dispositions of
    Businesses or Difficulties Integrating and Managing Growth of
    Such Businesses

We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses
    in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    Acquisition and disposition activity exposes us to a number of
    risks.

There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments,
    including goodwill impairments, that arise in connection with
    the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may
    acquire in the future.

In addition, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that
    we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing
    due diligence investigations on each business that we have
    acquired or may acquire. Furthermore, even for obligations and
    liabilities that we do discover during the due diligence
    process, neither the valuation adjustment nor the contractual
    protections we negotiate may be sufficient to fully protect us
    from losses. For example, in connection with the acquisition of
    ALICO, we may be exposed to obligations and liabilities of ALICO
    that are not adequately covered, in amount, scope or duration,
    by the indemnification provisions in the Stock Purchase
    Agreement or reflected or reserved for in ALICO’s
    historical financial statements. Although we have rights to
    indemnification from ALICO Holdings under the Stock Purchase
    Agreement for certain losses, our rights are limited by survival
    periods for bringing claims and monetary limitations on the
    amount we may recover, and we cannot be certain that
    indemnification will be, among other things, collectible or
    sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset any loss
    we may suffer.

Furthermore, the use of our own funds as consideration in any
    acquisition would consume capital resources that would no longer
    be available for other corporate purposes. We also may not be
    able to raise sufficient funds to consummate an acquisition if,
    for example, we are unable to sell our securities or close
    related bridge credit facilities. Moreover, as a result of
    uncertainty and risks associated with potential acquisitions and
    dispositions of businesses, rating agencies may take certain
    actions with respect to the ratings assigned to MetLife, Inc.

and/or

its
    subsidiaries.

Our ability to achieve certain benefits we anticipate from any
    acquisitions of businesses will depend in large part upon our
    ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an
    efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to integrate
    such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may
    take longer than expected. The integration of operations and
    differences in operational culture may require the dedication of
    significant management resources, which may distract
    management’s attention from

day-to-day

business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the
    operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to
    realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such
    acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be
    less than expected.



The success with which we are able to integrate acquired
    operations, will depend on our ability to manage a variety of
    issues, including the following:

•

Loss of key personnel or higher than expected employee attrition
    rates could adversely affect the performance of the acquired
    business and our ability to integrate it successfully.

•

Customers of the acquired business may reduce, delay or defer
    decisions concerning their use of its products and services as a
    result of the acquisition or uncertainty related to the
    consummation of the acquisition, including, for example,
    potential unfamiliarity with the MetLife brand in regions where
    MetLife did not have a market presence prior to the acquisition.

•

If the acquired business relies upon independent distributors to
    distribute its products, these distributors may not continue to
    generate the same volume of business for MetLife after the
    acquisition. Independent distributors may reexamine the scope of
    their relationship with the acquired business or MetLife as a
    result of the acquisition and decide to curtail or eliminate
    distribution of our products.

•

Integrating acquired operations with our existing operations may
    require us to coordinate geographically separated organizations,
    address possible differences in corporate culture and management
    philosophies, merge financial processes and risk and compliance
    procedures, combine separate information technology platforms
    and integrate operations that were previously closely tied to
    the former parent of the acquired business or other service
    providers.

•

In cases where we or an acquired business operates in certain
    markets through joint ventures, the acquisition may affect the
    continued success and prospects of the joint venture. Our
    ability to exercise management control or influence over these
    joint venture operations and our investment in them will depend
    on the continued cooperation between the joint venture
    participants and on the terms of the joint venture agreements,
    which allocate control among the joint venture participants. We
    may face financial or other exposure in the event that any of
    these joint venture partners fail to meet their obligations
    under the joint venture, encounter financial difficulty or elect
    to alter, modify or terminate the relationship.

•

We may incur significant costs in connection with any
    acquisition and the related integration. The costs and
    liabilities actually incurred in connection with an acquisition
    and subsequent integration process may exceed those anticipated.

All of these challenges are present in our integration of ALICO,
    which we expect to extend over a substantial period.

The prospects of our business also may be materially and
    adversely affected if we are not able to manage the growth of
    any acquired business successfully. For example, the life
    insurance markets in many of the international markets in which
    ALICO operates have experienced significant growth in recent
    years. Management of ALICO’s growth to date has required
    significant management and operational resources and is likely
    to continue to do so. Future growth of our combined business
    will require, among other things, the continued development of
    adequate underwriting and claim handling capabilities and
    skills, sufficient capital base, increased marketing and sales
    activities, and the hiring and training of new personnel.

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing
    future growth of any acquired business, including ALICO. In
    particular, there may be difficulties in hiring and training
    sufficient numbers of customer service personnel and agents to
    keep pace with any future growth in the number of customers in
    our developing or developed markets. In addition, we may
    experience difficulties in upgrading, developing and expanding
    information technology systems quickly enough to accommodate any
    future growth. If we are unable to manage future growth, our
    prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

There
    Can Be No Assurance That the Closing Agreement American Life
    Entered Into With the IRS Will Achieve Its Intended Effect, or
    That American Life Will Be Able to Comply with the Related
    Agreed Upon Plan

On March 4, 2010, American Life entered into a closing
    agreement with the Commissioner of the IRS with respect to a
    U.S. withholding tax issue arising from payments by foreign
    branches of a life insurance company



incorporated under U.S. law. IRS Revenue Ruling

2004-75,

effective January 1, 2005, requires foreign branches of
    U.S. life insurance companies in certain circumstances to
    withhold U.S. income taxes on payments of taxable income
    made with respect to certain insurance and annuity products paid
    to customers resident in a foreign country. The closing
    agreement provides transitional relief under
    Section 7805(b) of the Code to American Life, such that
    American Life’s foreign branches will not be required to
    withhold U.S. income tax on the income portion of payments
    made pursuant to American Life’s life insurance and annuity
    contracts (“Covered Payments”) under IRS Revenue
    Ruling

2004-75

for
    any tax periods beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on
    December 31, 2013 (the “Deferral Period”). In
    accordance with the closing agreement, American Life submitted a
    plan to the IRS indicating the steps American Life will take (on
    a country by country basis) to ensure that no substantial amount
    of U.S. withholding tax will arise from Covered Payments
    made by American Life’s foreign branches to foreign
    customers after the Deferral Period. In addition, the closing
    agreement requires that such plan be updated in quarterly
    filings with the IRS. The closing agreement is final and binding
    upon American Life and the IRS;

provided

,

however

,
    that the agreement can be reopened in the event of malfeasance,
    fraud or a misrepresentation of a material fact, and is subject
    to change of law risk that occurs after the effective date of
    the closing agreement (with certain exceptions). In addition,
    the closing agreement provides that no legislative amendment to
    Section 861(a)(1)(A) of the Code shall shorten the Deferral
    Period, regardless of when such amendment is enacted. The plan
    American Life delivered to the IRS involves the transfer of
    businesses from certain of the foreign branches of American Life
    to one or more existing or newly-formed foreign affiliates of
    American Life; however, the plan is subject to change pursuant
    to the quarterly updates that American Life will provide to the
    IRS. An estimate of the costs to comply with the plan has been
    recorded in the financial statements. Also the achievement of
    the plan presented to the IRS within the required time frame of
    December 31, 2013 is contingent upon regulatory approvals
    and other requirements. Failure to achieve the plan in a timely
    manner could cause American Life to be required to withhold
    U.S. income taxes on the taxable portion of payments made
    by American Life’s foreign branches after December 31,
    2013 to customers resident in a foreign country, which could put
    American Life at a competitive disadvantage with its competitors
    that sell similar products through foreign entities and could
    have a material adverse effect on American Life’s future
    revenues or expenses or both.

There
    Can Be No Assurance That Any Incremental Tax Benefit Will Result
    From the Currently Planned Elections Under Section 338 of
    the Code

MetLife, Inc. currently plans to make Section 338 Elections
    with respect to ALICO and certain of its subsidiaries, and
    MetLife, Inc. believes that ALICO and such subsidiaries should
    have additional amortizable basis in their assets for
    U.S. tax purposes as a result of such elections. No
    assurance can be given, however, as to the incremental tax
    benefit, if any, that will result from any such elections,
    if made.

The
    Issuance of Certain Equity Securities to ALICO Holdings in
    Connection with the Acquisition Will Have a Dilutive Impact on
    MetLife, Inc.’s Stockholders

As part of the consideration paid to ALICO Holdings pursuant to
    the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, MetLife, Inc. issued
    to ALICO Holdings (A) 78,239,712 shares of its common
    stock, (B) 6,857,000 shares of the Series B
    Contingent Convertible Junior Participating Non-Cumulative
    Perpetual Preferred Stock (the “Convertible Preferred
    Stock”), which will be convertible into approximately
    68,570,000 shares of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) upon a favorable vote of
    MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders, and
    (C) $3.0 billion aggregate stated amount of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common equity units, which initially consist of
    (x) purchase contracts obligating the holder to purchase a
    variable number of shares of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    on each of three specified future settlement dates
    (approximately two, three and four years after the closing of
    the Acquisition, subject to deferral under certain
    circumstances) for a fixed amount per purchase contract (an
    aggregate of $1.0 billion on each settlement date) (the
    “Stock Purchase Contracts”) and (y) an interest
    in each of three series of debt securities of MetLife, Inc. The
    aggregate amount of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock expected
    to be issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the
    Acquisition (including shares of common stock issuable upon
    conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock and shares of
    common stock issuable upon settlement of the Stock Purchase
    Contracts) is expected to be approximately 214,600,000 to
    231,500,000 shares.



As a result of the issuance of these securities, more shares of
    common stock will be outstanding and each existing stockholder
    will own a smaller percentage of our common stock then
    outstanding.

Subject
    to Certain Limitations, ALICO Holdings Will Be Able to Sell
    MetLife, Inc.’s Equity Securities at Any Time From and
    After the Date 270 Days After the Closing of the Acquisition,
    Which Could Cause MetLife, Inc.’s Stock Price to
    Decrease

ALICO Holdings agreed in the Investor Rights Agreement entered
    into in connection with the Acquisition, not to transfer any of
    MetLife, Inc.’s securities received pursuant to the terms
    of the Stock Purchase Agreement, at any time up to the date
    270 days after the closing of the Acquisition, without the
    consent of MetLife, Inc. However, from and after such date,
    ALICO Holdings will be able to transfer up to half of such
    equity securities, and from and after the first anniversary of
    the closing of the Acquisition, ALICO Holdings will be able to
    transfer all of such securities, subject in each case to certain
    limited volume and timing restrictions set forth in the Investor
    Rights Agreement. Moreover, ALICO Holdings will agree to use
    commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, and it will cause
    its affiliates to so transfer, all of MetLife, Inc.’s
    securities received in connection with the Acquisition prior to
    the later of (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing of
    the Acquisition, and (ii) the first anniversary of the
    third stock purchase date under the Stock Purchase Contracts.
    Subject to certain conditions, we have agreed to register the
    resale of MetLife, Inc.’s equity and other securities to be
    issued to ALICO Holdings under the Securities Act. The sale or
    transfer of a substantial number of these securities within a
    short period of time could cause MetLife, Inc.’s stock
    price to decrease, make it more difficult for us to raise funds
    through future offerings of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock or
    acquire other businesses using MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    as consideration.

If
    MetLife, Inc.’s Stockholders Do Not Vote to Approve the
    Conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock Into Common Stock,
    MetLife, Inc. Will Be Required to Pay Approximately $300 Million
    to ALICO Holdings

ALICO Holdings received shares of the Convertible Preferred
    Stock upon completion of the Acquisition. Each share of
    Convertible Preferred Stock will convert into 10 shares of
    MetLife, Inc.’s common stock (subject to anti-dilution
    adjustments) if conversion is approved by MetLife, Inc.’s
    common stockholders. If we fail to obtain such approval prior to
    the first anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition,
    November 1, 2011, MetLife, Inc. will be required to pay
    approximately $300 million to ALICO Holdings, assuming no
    purchase price adjustments, and, upon request, register the
    Convertible Preferred Stock for sale by ALICO Holdings in a
    public offering and list the Convertible Preferred Stock on the
    NYSE.

Fluctuations
    in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our
    Profitability

We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting
    from our holdings of

non-U.S. dollar

denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and
    net income from foreign operations and issuance of

non-U.S. dollar

denominated instruments, including guaranteed interest contracts
    and funding agreements. These risks relate to potential
    decreases in estimated fair value and income resulting from a
    strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the
    U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign
    currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the
    estimated fair value of our

non-U.S. dollar

denominated investments, our investments in foreign
    subsidiaries, and our net income from foreign operations.
    Although we use foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to
    mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk, we cannot provide
    assurance that these methods will be effective or that our
    counterparties will perform their obligations. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

From time to time, various emerging market countries have
    experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
    significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to
    foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in
    certain emerging markets.

Historically, we have matched substantially all of our foreign
    currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with
    investments denominated in their respective foreign currency,
    which limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on
    local operating results; however, fluctuations in such rates
    affect the translation of these results into our
    U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements.
    Although we take certain actions to address this risk, foreign



currency exchange rate fluctuation could materially adversely
    affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the
    failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

The Acquisition has increased our exposure to risks associated
    with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the
    U.S. dollar and increased our exposure to emerging markets.
    Fluctuations in the yen/ U.S. dollar exchange rate can have
    a significant effect on our reported financial position and
    results of operations because ALICO has substantial operations
    in Japan and a significant portion of its premiums and
    investment income are received in yen. Claims and expenses are
    also paid in yen and ALICO primarily purchases yen-denominated
    assets to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. These and
    other yen-denominated financial statement items are, however,
    translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting
    purposes. Accordingly, fluctuations in the yen/U.S. dollar
    exchange rate can have a significant effect on our reported
    financial position and results of operations.

Due to our significant international operations, during periods
    when any foreign currency in which we derive our revenues (such
    as the Japanese yen) weakens, translating amounts expressed in
    that currency into U.S. dollars causes fewer
    U.S. dollars to be reported. When the relevant foreign
    currency strengthens, translating such currency into
    U.S. dollars causes more U.S. dollars to be reported.
    Between September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, the
    Japanese yen has strengthened against the U.S. dollar,
    which fluctuated from a low point of ¥80.40 to the
    U.S. dollar on October 29, 2010 to a high point of
    ¥84.26 to the U.S. dollar on November 29, 2010,
    which has been somewhat offset by the weakening of the euro,
    which fluctuated from a high point of 0.7702 euro to the
    U.S. dollar on November 30, 2010, to 0.7039 euro to
    the U.S. dollar on November 4, 2010. Any unrealized
    foreign currency translation adjustments are reported in
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The weakening of
    a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar will
    generally adversely affect the value of investments in
    U.S. dollar terms and reduce the level of reserves
    denominated in that currency.

Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic
    Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability

Our international operations face political, legal, operational
    and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations.
    We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization
    or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls
    or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds
    from these operations out of the countries in which they operate
    or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or
    other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are,
    and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where
    these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we
    rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter
    labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and
    trade unions in some countries. In several countries, including
    Japan, China and India, we operate with local business partners
    with the resulting risk of managing partner relationships to the
    business objectives. If our business model is not successful in
    a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment
    in building and training the sales force in that country. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Executive
    Summary” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

We are expanding our international operations in certain markets
    where we operate and in selected new markets. This may require
    considerable management time, as well as

start-up

expenses for market development before any significant revenues
    and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets
    may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in
    existing markets may be affected by local economic and market
    conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not
    achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations
    may be negatively impacted.

In addition, in recent years, the operating environment in
    Argentina has been very challenging. In Argentina, we were
    formerly principally engaged in the pension business. In
    December 2008, the Argentine government nationalized private
    pensions and seized the pension funds’ investments,
    eliminating the private pensions business in Argentina. As a
    result, we have experienced and will continue to experience
    reductions in the operation’s revenues and cash flows. The
    Argentine government now controls all assets which previously
    were managed by our



Argentine pension operations. Further governmental or legal
    actions related to our operations in Argentina could negatively
    impact our operations in Argentina and result in future losses.

We have market presence in over 60 different countries and
    increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic
    conditions. Europe has recently experienced a deep recession and
    countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and, in particular,
    Greece and Ireland, have been particularly affected by the
    recession, resulting in increased national debts and depressed
    economic activity. We have significant operations and
    investments in these countries which could be adversely affected
    by economic developments such as higher taxes, growing
    inflation, decreasing government spending, rising unemployment
    and currency instability.

In addition to fluctuations in the yen/U.S. dollar exchange
    rate discussed above, we face increased exposure to the Japanese
    markets as a result of ALICO’s considerable presence there.
    Deterioration in Japan’s economic recovery could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition.

We also have operations in the Middle East where the legal and
    political systems and regulatory frameworks are subject to
    instability and disruptions. Lack of legal certainty and
    stability in the region exposes our operations to increased risk
    of disruption and to adverse or unpredictable actions by
    regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our
    contracts, which may negatively impact our business in this
    region. See also “— Changes in Market Interest
    Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding
    the impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.

As a
    Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its
    Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds to It to Meet Its Obligations and
    Pay Dividends

MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and
    financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant
    operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and
    permitted payments to it under its tax sharing arrangements with
    its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its
    obligations and to pay preferred and common stock dividends. If
    the cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries is
    insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding
    company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may be required to raise cash
    through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional
    equity or the sale of assets.

The payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife,
    Inc. by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance
    laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of
    prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In
    addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of
    dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to
    MetLife, Inc. if they determine that the payment could be
    adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. The payment of
    dividends and other distributions by insurance companies is also
    influenced by business conditions and rating agency
    considerations. See “Business —
    U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation” and
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Holding Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from
    Subsidiaries.” The ability of MetLife Bank to pay dividends
    is also subject to regulation by the OCC.

Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or
    advances by our foreign subsidiaries and branches to MetLife,
    Inc. could be subject to taxation or other restrictions on
    dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable law,
    monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange
    regulations in the jurisdiction in which such foreign
    subsidiaries operate. See “Business —
    International Regulation” and “— Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic
    Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability.”

A
    Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or
    Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Financial strength ratings, which various Nationally Recognized
    Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSRO”) publish as
    indicators of an insurance company’s ability to meet
    contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to
    maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to
    market our products and our competitive position.



Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including:

•

reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other
    investment products;

•

adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and
    independent sales intermediaries;

•

materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders
    and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;

•

requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and
    services to remain competitive; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at
    reasonable prices or at all.

In addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance
    subsidiaries, various NRSROs also publish credit ratings for
    MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries. Credit ratings
    are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms
    of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors
    in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain
    types of liquidity. Downgrades in our credit ratings could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our
    access to capital markets, potentially increasing the cost of
    debt, and requiring us to post collateral. For example, with
    respect to derivative transactions with credit ratings downgrade
    triggers, a one-notch downgrade would have increased our
    derivative collateral requirements by $99 million at
    December 31, 2010. Also, $375 million of liabilities
    associated with funding agreements and other capital market
    products were subject to credit ratings downgrade triggers that
    permit early termination subject to a notice period of
    90 days.

In view of the difficulties experienced during 2008 and 2009 by
    many financial institutions, including our competitors in the
    insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs
    will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply
    to such institutions, will continue to increase the frequency
    and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request
    additional information from the companies that they rate, and
    may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in
    the NRSRO models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.
    Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable,” “negative”
    or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term
    trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a
    ratings change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook
    to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however,
    a “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency
    from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain
    rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as
    “CreditWatch” or “Under Review” to indicate
    their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating.
    These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection
    with certain events such as potential mergers and acquisitions,
    or material changes in a company’s results, in order for
    the rating agencies to perform their analyses to fully determine
    the rating implications of the event. Certain rating agencies
    have recently implemented rating actions, including downgrades,
    outlook changes and modifiers, for MetLife, Inc.’s and
    certain of its subsidiaries’ insurer financial strength and
    credit ratings.

Based on the announcement in February 2010 that MetLife was in
    discussions to acquire ALICO, in February 2010, S&P and
    A.M. Best placed the ratings of MetLife, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries on “CreditWatch with negative
    implications” and “under review with negative
    implications,” respectively. Also in connection with the
    announcement, in March 2010, Moody’s changed the ratings
    outlook of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries from
    “stable” to “negative” outlook. Upon
    completion of the public financing transactions related to the
    Acquisition, in August 2010, S&P affirmed the ratings of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries with a “negative”
    outlook, and removed them from “CreditWatch.” On
    November 1, 2010, upon closing of the Acquisition, S&P
    changed the rating outlook of ALICO to “positive” from
    “negative” and affirmed its financial strength rating;
    the ratings of MetLife, Inc. and its other subsidiaries were
    unaffected by this ratings action. Also on November 1,
    2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded by one notch (and changed the
    rating outlook from “Rating Watch Positive” to
    “stable”) the financial strength rating of American
    Life and affirmed all existing ratings for MetLife, Inc. and its
    other subsidiaries. On November 4, 2010, A.M. Best
    upgraded by one notch the financial strength rating of American
    Life and changed the rating outlook from “under review with
    positive implications” to “negative.”
    A.M. Best also changed the outlook for MetLife, Inc. and
    certain of its other subsidiaries to “negative” from
    “under review with negative implications.” Effective
    as of January in 2011, MetLife withdrew the American Life
    financial strength ratings by A.M. Best and Fitch Ratings
    as once it became a subsidiary of MetLife it was not deemed
    necessary to maintain stand-alone ratings.



On July 1, 2010, Moody’s published revised guidance
    called “Revisions to Moody’s Hybrid Tool Kit”
    (the “Guidance”) for assigning equity credit to
    so-called hybrid securities, i.e., securities with both debt and
    equity characteristics (“Hybrids”). Moody’s
    evaluates Hybrids using certain specified criteria and then
    places each such security into a “basket,” with a
    specific percentage of debt and equity being associated with
    each basket, which is then used to adjust full sets of financial
    statements for purposes of, among other things, calculating the
    issuing company’s financial leverage. Under the Guidance,
    Hybrids are one element that Moody’s considers within the
    context of an issuer’s overall credit profile. As of
    December 31, 2010, we have approximately $11.1 billion
    of Hybrids outstanding, which includes approximately
    $6.2 billion of debt securities and $4.9 billion of
    equity securities. Application of the Guidance has resulted in
    Moody’s significantly reducing the amount of equity credit
    it assigns to these securities, including the common equity
    units issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the
    Acquisition. We do not expect at this time, as a result of the
    Guidance, that a reduction in Moody’s equity treatment of
    our Hybrids, including the common equity units, would result in
    any material negative impact on MetLife, Inc.’s credit
    rating or the financial strength ratings of its insurance
    company subsidiaries. However, if we decided to increase our
    adjusted capital as a result of the application of the Guidance,
    we may seek to (i) issue additional common equity or higher
    equity content Hybrids satisfying the Guidance’s revised
    rating criteria,

and/or

(ii) redeem, repurchase or restructure existing Hybrids.
    Any sale of additional common equity would have a dilutive
    effect on our common stockholders.

We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what
    actions we may take in response to the actions of rating
    agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with
    other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings
    could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any
    NRSRO.

An
    Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a
    Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit
    and Financial Strength Ratings

In October 2010, we entered into two senior unsecured credit
    facilities: a three-year $3 billion facility and a

364-day

$1 billion facility. We also have other facilities which we
    enter into in the ordinary course of business. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Credit and Committed
    Facilities” and Notes 11 and 24 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of
    liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be
    critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our
    ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market
    when alternative sources of credit are tight. The credit
    facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants. We must comply with covenants under our
    credit facilities, including a requirement to maintain a
    specified minimum consolidated net worth.

Our right to make borrowings under these facilities is subject
    to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including
    our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow
    under these facilities is also subject to the continued
    willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the
    facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the
    covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to
    borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending
    commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other
    reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the
    facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit
    facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Defaults,
    Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Carrying Value of Our
    Fixed Maturity or Equity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our
    Earnings

We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of
    fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and
    interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk
    that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities,
    including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal
    and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows.
    Fixed maturity securities represent a significant portion of our
    investment portfolio. The occurrence of a major economic
    downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads,
    or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or
    underlying collateral of these securities could cause the
    estimated fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio
    and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the



fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to
    increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of
    particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the
    credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of
    securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a
    similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of
    issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a
    ratings downgrade affecting a security we hold could indicate
    the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could
    increase the capital we must hold to support that security to
    maintain our RBC levels. Any event reducing the estimated fair
    value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition. Levels of writedowns or
    impairments are impacted by our assessment of intent to sell, or
    whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to
    sell, fixed maturity securities and the intent and ability to
    hold equity securities which have declined in value until
    recovery. If we determine to reposition or realign portions of
    the portfolio so as not to hold certain equity securities, or
    intend to sell or determine that it is more likely than not that
    we will be required to sell, certain fixed maturity securities
    in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery, then we will
    incur an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in the period that the decision was made not
    to hold the equity security to recovery, or to sell, or the
    determination was made it is more likely than not that we will
    be required to sell the fixed maturity security.

Our
    Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to
    Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Business

Management of risk requires, among other things, policies and
    procedures to record properly and verify a large number of
    transactions and events. We have devoted significant resources
    to develop our risk management policies and procedures and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
    policies and procedures may not be comprehensive. Many of our
    methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use
    of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on
    historical models. As a result, these methods may not fully
    predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater
    than our historical measures indicate. Other risk management
    methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding
    markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that
    is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This
    information may not always be accurate, complete,

up-to-date

or properly evaluated. See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Reinsurance
    May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us
    Against Losses

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    business segments. See “Business — Reinsurance
    Activity.” While reinsurance agreements generally bind the
    reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally
    fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine
    the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new
    business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for
    business already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any
    increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we
    may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or
    may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable
    terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future
    business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect
    to those policies we issue.

If the
    Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification
    Arrangements or to the Derivative Instruments We Use to Hedge
    Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed
    to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivative instruments
    to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general,
    reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
    policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us.
    Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers
    and indemnitors. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers
    will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that
    indemnitors will honor their obligations now or in the future or
    that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A
    reinsurer’s or indemnitor’s insolvency, inability or
    unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance
    agreements or indemnity agreements with us could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.



In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various
    business risks. We enter into a variety of derivative
    instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit
    default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments.” If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor
    their obligations under these derivative instruments, our hedges
    of the related risk will be ineffective. This is a more
    pronounced risk to us in view of the stresses suffered by
    financial institutions over the past few years. Such failure
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Differences
    Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving
    Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Results

Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our
    actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we
    use in setting prices for our products and establishing
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Our
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are
    established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will
    need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance
    and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on
    many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to
    be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of
    the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of
    benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the
    investments we make with the premiums we receive. We establish
    liabilities for property and casualty claims and benefits based
    on assumptions and estimates of damages and liabilities
    incurred. To the extent that actual claims experience is less
    favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in
    establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase
    our liabilities.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for
    future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely
    the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our
    liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when those payments may not occur until well into
    the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on
    accounting requirements, which change from time to time, the
    assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as well as our
    actual experience. We charge or credit changes in our
    liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are
    established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally
    established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we
    must increase them. Such increases could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Catastrophes
    May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and
    Reinsurance Availability

Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of
    catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that
    causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics
    have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the
    likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be
    predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on
    the global economy or the economies of particular countries or
    regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system,
    food supply, consumption, overall economic output and,
    eventually, on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic
    that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors
    or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt
    our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties,
    including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in
    combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have
    a material impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group
    insurance operations, a localized event that affects the
    workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could
    cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims.
    These events could cause a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations in any period and, depending on their
    severity, could also materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition.

Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will
    likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may
    have a material adverse impact on the business, results of
    operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home
    segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to
    manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility
    management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not
    eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
    tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow,
    freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made
    events such as terrorist attacks. Historically, substantially
    all of our catastrophe-related claims have related to homeowners
    coverages.



However, catastrophes may also affect other Auto &
    Home coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the
    incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition,
    changing climate conditions, primarily rising global
    temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase,
    the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as
    hurricanes.

Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our
    homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include
    coastal sections of the northeastern U.S. (including lower New
    York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts), the Gulf
    Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas) and
    Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure, primarily along
    the New Madrid fault line in the central U.S. and in the Pacific
    Northwest.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
    the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes,
    earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce significant
    damage or loss of life in larger areas, especially those that
    are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made
    catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our
    financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could
    materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial
    condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial
    condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability
    of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new
    business could also be affected. It is possible that increases
    in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other
    factors, and geographic concentration of insured property, could
    increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the
    future.

Most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries
    are admitted to transact business require life and property and
    casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to
    participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay
    contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued
    by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations
    levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member
    insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate
    share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of
    business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is
    engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or
    controlled organizations providing life and property and
    casualty insurance to their citizens. The activities of such
    organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy
    of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also
    have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the
    guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member
    insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial
    premium tax offsets. See “Business —
    U.S. Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements” and “Business — International
    Regulation.”

While in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied
    against MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries have not
    been material, it is possible that a large catastrophic event
    could render such guaranty funds inadequate and we may be called
    upon to contribute additional amounts, which may have a material
    impact on our financial condition or results of operations in a
    particular period. We have established liabilities for guaranty
    fund assessments that we consider adequate for assessments with
    respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency
    proceedings, but additional liabilities may be necessary. See
    Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we
    establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only
    after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We
    cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will
    be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to
    time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of
    limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as
    legislation restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw
    from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our
    exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed
    by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or
    multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our
    property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in
    part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may
    not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future.
    See “— Reinsurance May Not Be Available,
    Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.”



Our
    Statutory Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases
    and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market
    Capacity

To support statutory reserves for several products, including,
    but not limited to, our level premium term life and universal
    life with secondary guarantees and MLIC’s closed block, we
    currently utilize capital markets solutions for financing a
    portion of our statutory reserve requirements. While we have
    financing facilities in place for our previously written
    business and have remaining capacity in existing facilities to
    support writings through the end of 2010 or later, certain of
    these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the
    occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of MetLife or are
    subject to periodic repricing. Any resulting cost increases
    could negatively impact our financial results.

Future capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures
    in the marketplace is not guaranteed. If capacity becomes
    unavailable for a prolonged period of time, hindering our
    ability to obtain funding for these new structures, our ability
    to write additional business in a cost effective manner may be
    impacted.

Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability

Our segments are subject to intense competition. We believe that
    this competition is based on a number of factors, including
    service, product features, scale, price, financial strength,
    claims-paying ratings, credit ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurers, as well as non-insurance financial
    services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset
    managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group
    customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and
    investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader
    array of products, have more competitive pricing or more
    attractive features in their products or, with respect to other
    insurers, have higher claims paying ability ratings. Some may
    also have greater financial resources with which to compete.
    National banks, which may sell annuity products of life insurers
    in some circumstances, also have pre-existing customer bases for
    financial services products. Many of our group insurance
    products are underwritten annually, and, accordingly, there is a
    risk that group purchasers may be able to obtain more favorable
    terms from competitors rather than renewing coverage with us.
    The effect of competition may, as a result, adversely affect the
    persistency of these and other products, as well as our ability
    to sell products in the future.

In addition, the investment management and securities brokerage
    businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually
    attract new entrants. See “Business —
    Competition.”

Finally, the new requirements imposed on the financial industry
    by Dodd-Frank could similarly have differential effects. See
    “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our
    Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth.”

Industry
    Trends Could Adversely Affect the Profitability of Our
    Businesses

Our segments continue to be influenced by a variety of trends
    that affect the insurance industry, including competition with
    respect to product features, price, distribution capability,
    customer service and information technology. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Industry
    Trends.” The impact on our business and on the life
    insurance industry generally of the volatility and instability
    of the financial markets is difficult to predict, and our
    business plans, financial condition and results of operations
    may be negatively impacted or affected in other unexpected ways.
    In addition, the life insurance industry is subject to state
    regulation, and, as complex products are introduced, regulators
    may refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving
    standards. Dodd-Frank, Basel III and the market environment
    in general may also lead to changes in regulation that may
    benefit or disadvantage us relative to some of our competitors.
    See “Business — Competition,”
    “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May
    Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability.”



Consolidation
    of Distributors of Insurance Products May Adversely Affect the
    Insurance Industry and the Profitability of Our
    Business

The insurance industry distributes many of its individual
    products through other financial institutions such as banks and
    broker-dealers. An increase in bank and broker-dealer
    consolidation activity may negatively impact the industry’s
    sales, and such consolidation could increase competition for
    access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses
    and impair our ability to market insurance products to our
    current customer base or to expand our customer base.
    Consolidation of distributors

and/or

other
    industry changes may also increase the likelihood that
    distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing
    selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.

Our
    Valuation of Fixed Maturity, Equity and Trading and Other
    Securities and Short-Term Investments May Include Methodologies,
    Estimations and Assumptions Which Are Subject to Differing
    Interpretations and Could Result in Changes to Investment
    Valuations That May Materially Adversely Affect Our Results of
    Operations or Financial Condition

Fixed maturity, equity, and trading and other securities and
    short-term investments which are reported at estimated fair
    value on the consolidated balance sheets represent the majority
    of our total cash and investments. We have categorized these
    securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority
    of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability’s
    classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
    lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The input
    levels are as follows:

Level 1 —

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. We define active markets based on average
    trading volume for equity securities. The size of the bid/ask
    spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed
    maturity securities.

Level 2 —

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other significant inputs that are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.

Level 3 —

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of the estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

At December 31, 2010, 7.0%, 85.8% and 7.2% of these
    securities represented Level 1, Level 2 and
    Level 3, respectively. The Level 1 securities
    primarily consist of certain U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities; certain foreign
    government fixed maturity securities; exchange-traded common
    stock; certain trading securities; certain fair value option
    securities and certain short-term investments. The Level 2
    assets include fixed maturity and equity securities priced
    principally through independent pricing services using
    observable inputs. These fixed maturity securities include most
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities,
    as well as the majority of U.S. and foreign corporate
    securities, RMBS, CMBS, state and political subdivision
    securities, foreign government securities, and ABS. Equity
    securities classified as Level 2 primarily consist of
    non-redeemable preferred securities and certain equity
    securities where market quotes are available but are not
    considered actively traded and are priced by independent pricing
    services. We review the valuation methodologies used by the
    independent pricing services on an ongoing basis and ensure that
    any changes to valuation methodologies are justified.
    Level 3 assets include fixed maturity securities priced
    principally through independent non-binding broker quotations or
    market standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are
    not



market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 consists of
    less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading
    activity or where less price transparency exists around the
    inputs to the valuation methodologies including: U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities — including below
    investment grade private placements; RMBS; CMBS; and
    ABS — including all of those supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans. Equity securities classified as Level 3
    securities consist principally of nonredeemable preferred stock
    and common stock of companies that are privately held or
    companies for which there has been very limited trading activity
    or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation.

Prices provided by independent pricing services and independent
    non-binding broker quotations can vary widely even for the same
    security.

The determination of estimated fair values by management in the
    absence of quoted market prices is based on: (i) valuation
    methodologies; (ii) securities we deem to be comparable;
    and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of
    the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts. During periods of
    market disruption including periods of significantly rising or
    high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or
    illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of our
    securities, for example

sub-prime

mortgage-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities where the
    underlying loans are Alt-A and CMBS, if trading becomes less
    frequent

and/or

market data becomes less observable. In times of financial
    market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active
    markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In
    such cases, more securities may fall to Level 3 and thus
    require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such,
    valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less
    observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation
    methods which are more sophisticated or require greater
    estimation thereby resulting in estimated fair values which may
    be greater or less than the amount at which the investments may
    be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented
    credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the
    valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated
    financial statements and the

period-to-period

changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly.
    Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial condition.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well, We May Be Required to Recognize
    an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to
    Establish a Valuation Allowance Against the Deferred Income Tax
    Asset, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or
    Financial Condition

Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire
    subsidiaries and other businesses over the estimated fair value
    of their net assets at the date of acquisition. As of
    December 31, 2010, our goodwill was $11,781, of which
    $6,959 of goodwill was established in connection with the
    acquisition of ALICO. We test goodwill at least annually for
    impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates
    of the estimated fair value of the “reporting unit” to
    which the goodwill relates. The reporting unit is the operating
    segment or a business one level below that operating segment if
    discrete financial information is prepared and regularly
    reviewed by management at that level. The estimated fair value
    of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the
    business. The performance of our businesses may be adversely
    impacted by prolonged market declines. If it is determined that
    the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill
    by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to
    net income. Such writedowns could have an adverse effect on our
    results of operation or financial position. For example, our
    goodwill has increased substantially as a result of the
    Acquisition. Market factors, the failure of ALICO to perform
    well, or issues relating to the integration of ALICO could
    result in the reporting units containing parts of ALICO having
    fair values lower than their respective carrying values, which
    would result in a writedown of goodwill and, consequently, it
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates —
    Goodwill.”

Long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also
    require impairment testing to determine whether changes in
    circumstances indicate that MetLife will be unable to recover
    the carrying amount of the asset group



through future operations of that asset group or market
    conditions that will impact the estimated fair value of those
    assets. Such writedowns could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or financial position.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences
    between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to
    determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s
    determination include the performance of the business including
    the ability to generate future taxable income. If based on
    available information, it is more likely than not that the
    deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation
    allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net
    income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus
    Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC, Deferred Sales
    Inducements (“DSI”) and VOBA Vary Significantly, We
    May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization and/or Impair the
    DAC, DSI and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of
    Operations or Financial Condition

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and
    renewal business. Those costs that vary with and are primarily
    related to the production of new and renewal business are
    deferred and referred to as DAC. Bonus amounts credited to
    certain policyholders, either immediately upon receiving a
    deposit or as excess interest credits for a period of time, are
    referred to as DSI. The recovery of DAC and DSI is dependent
    upon the future profitability of the related business. The
    amount of future profit or margin is dependent principally on
    investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest
    crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to
    administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance
    counterparties and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment
    returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of
    such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into
    management’s estimates of gross profits or margins, which
    generally are used to amortize such costs.

If the estimates of gross profits or margins were overstated,
    then the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the
    period the actual experience is known and would result in a
    charge to income. Significant or sustained equity market
    declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of the
    DAC and DSI related to variable annuity and variable universal
    life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such
    adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial condition.

VOBA is an intangible asset that represents the excess of book
    value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance,
    annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the
    acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired
    liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections, by
    each block of business, of future policy and contract charges,
    premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance,
    surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns,
    nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual
    experience on the purchased business may vary from these
    projections. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the
    amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions
    are made and could result in a charge to income. Also, as VOBA
    is amortized similarly to DAC and DSI, an acceleration of the
    amortization of VOBA would occur if the estimates of gross
    profits or margins were overstated. Accordingly, the
    amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period in
    which the actual experience is known and would result in a
    charge to net income. Significant or sustained equity market
    declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of the
    VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life
    contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such adjustments
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and
    Value of Business Acquired” for further consideration of
    DAC and VOBA.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board or Other Standard- Setting Bodies May Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP,
    which is periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to
    adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized
    authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting
    standard setters to expose new guidance which further interprets
    or seeks to revise accounting



pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or
    transactions, as well as to issue new standards expanding
    disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have
    been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in this annual
    and quarterly reports on

Form 10-K

and

Form 10-Q.

An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such
    proposals are subject to change through the exposure process
    and, therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot
    be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting
    standards we are required to adopt could change the current
    accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial
    statements and that such changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in Our Discount Rate, Expected Rate of Return and Expected
    Compensation Increase Assumptions for Our Pension and Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plans May Result in Increased Expenses
    and Reduce Our Profitability

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan
    costs based on our best estimates of future plan experience.
    These assumptions are reviewed regularly and include discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected
    increases in compensation levels and expected medical inflation.
    Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses
    and reduce our profitability. See Note 17 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on how changes
    in these assumptions would affect plan costs.

Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Products that Protect Policyholders
    Against Significant Downturns in Equity Markets May Decrease Our
    Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results if Hedging or
    Risk Management Strategies Prove Ineffective, Result in Higher
    Hedging Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty
    Risk

Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed
    benefits. These include guaranteed death benefits, guaranteed
    withdrawal benefits, lifetime withdrawal guarantees, guaranteed
    minimum accumulation benefits, and guaranteed minimum income
    benefits. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in
    equity markets, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest
    rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future
    policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities
    associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to net
    income. We use reinsurance in combination with derivative
    instruments to mitigate the liability exposure and the
    volatility of net income associated with these liabilities, and
    while we believe that these and other actions have mitigated the
    risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the
    guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative
    counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, we
    are subject to the risk that hedging and other management
    procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder
    behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events,
    produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management
    techniques employed. These, individually or collectively, may
    have a material adverse effect on net income, financial
    condition or liquidity. We are also subject to the risk that the
    cost of hedging these guaranteed minimum benefits increases as
    implied volatilities increase

and/or

interest rates decrease, resulting in a reduction to net income.

The valuation of certain of the foregoing liabilities (carried
    at fair value) includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk
    that reflects the credit standing of the issuing entity. This
    adjustment, which is not hedged, is based in part on publicly
    available information regarding credit spreads related to the
    Holding Company’s debt, including credit default swaps. In
    periods of extreme market volatility, movements in these credit
    spreads can have a significant impact on net income.

Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Life and Annuity Products May Increase Our
    Exposure to Foreign Exchange Risk, and Decrease Our
    Earnings

Certain of our life and annuity products are exposed to foreign
    exchange risk. Payments under these contracts may be required to
    be made in different currencies, depending on the circumstances.
    Therefore, payments may be required in a different currency than
    the currency upon which the liability valuation is based. If the
    currency upon which expected future payments are made
    strengthens relative to the currency upon which the liability
    valuation is based, the liability valuation may increase,
    resulting in a reduction of net income.



We May
    Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets
    Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed
    Block Policies

MLIC’s plan of reorganization, as amended (the
    “Plan”), required that we establish and operate an
    accounting mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that
    the reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own
    certain individual insurance policies of MLIC are met. See
    Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We allocated assets to the closed block in an amount
    that will produce cash flows which, together with anticipated
    revenue from the policies included in the closed block, are
    reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and
    liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not
    limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain
    expenses and tax, and to provide for the continuation of the
    policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the
    experience underlying such scales continues, and for appropriate
    adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We cannot
    provide assurance that the closed block assets, the cash flows
    generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenue
    from the policies included in the closed block will be
    sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these
    policies. If they are not sufficient, we must fund the
    shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for
    competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments
    with our general account funds.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of those
    policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are
    greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block
    was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies
    included in the closed block may be greater than they would be
    in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be
    available for distribution over time only to closed block
    policyholders.

Litigation
    and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our
    Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and/or
    Harm to Our Reputation

We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating
    our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our
    pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings
    specific to us and others generally applicable to business
    practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection
    with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may
    bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits
    alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or
    underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product
    design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits
    and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers.
    Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may
    seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and
    treble damages, and the damages claimed and the amount of any
    probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for
    substantial periods of time. See Note 16 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain.
    Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate
    documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of
    witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply
    the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented,
    whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information
    with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in
    our consolidated financial statements. The review includes
    senior legal and financial personnel. Estimates of possible
    losses or ranges of loss for particular matters cannot in the
    ordinary course be made with a reasonable degree of certainty.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated.

Liabilities have been established for a number of matters noted
    in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. It is possible that some of the matters could
    require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or
    establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated at
    December 31, 2010.



MLIC and its affiliates are currently defendants in numerous
    lawsuits including class actions and individual suits, alleging
    improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance
    policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.

In addition, MLIC is a defendant in a large number of lawsuits
    seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries
    allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. These lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and have alleged that MLIC learned or should have
    learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among
    other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those
    health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters
    may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate
    its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable
    uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be
    dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data
    is limited and it is difficult to predict with any certainty the
    numerous variables that can affect liability estimates,
    including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve
    claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and
    future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a
    particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the
    jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of
    tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow
    plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure took
    place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known,
    and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their
    amounts. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year. Accordingly, it is
    reasonably possible that our total exposure to asbestos claims
    may be materially greater than the liability recorded by us in
    our consolidated financial statements and that future charges to
    income may be necessary. The potential future charges could be
    material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which
    they are recorded.

We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as
    information requests, subpoenas and books and record
    examinations, from state and federal regulators and other
    authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant
    regulatory action against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the
    litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer
    significant reputational harm, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, including our ability to attract new customers,
    retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees.
    Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the
    price of stocks of companies in our industry.

The New York Attorney General announced on July 29, 2010
    that his office had launched a major fraud investigation into
    the life insurance industry for practices related to the use of
    retained asset accounts as a settlement option for death
    benefits and that subpoenas requesting comprehensive data
    related to retained asset accounts have been served on MetLife
    and other insurance carriers. We received the subpoena on
    July 30, 2010. We also have received requests for documents
    and information from U.S. congressional committees and
    members as well as various state regulatory bodies, including
    the New York Insurance Department. It is possible that other
    state and federal regulators or legislative bodies may pursue
    similar investigations or make related inquiries. We cannot
    predict what effect any such investigations might have on our
    earnings or the availability of our retained asset account known
    as the Total Control Account (“TCA”), but we believe
    that our financial statements taken as a whole would not be
    materially affected. We believe that any allegations that
    information about the TCA is not adequately disclosed or that
    the accounts are fraudulent or violate state or federal laws are
    without merit.

We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation,
    unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and
    other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated
    claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion,
    investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future,
    and we could become subject to further investigations and have
    lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In
    addition, increased regulatory



scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could
    result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide
    regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

We May
    Not be Able to Protect Our Intellectual Property and May be
    Subject to Infringement Claims

We rely on a combination of contractual rights with third
    parties and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws
    to establish and protect our intellectual property. Although we
    endeavor to protect our rights, third parties may infringe or
    misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to
    litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights, trademarks,
    patents, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope,
    validity or enforceability. This would represent a diversion of
    resources that may be significant and our efforts may not prove
    successful. The inability to secure or protect our intellectual
    property assets could have a material adverse effect on our
    business and our ability to compete.

We may be subject to claims by third parties for
    (i) patent, trademark or copyright infringement,
    (ii) breach of copyright, trademark or license usage
    rights, or (iii) misappropriation of trade secrets. Any
    such claims and any resulting litigation could result in
    significant expense and liability for damages. If we were found
    to have infringed or misappropriated a third-party patent or
    other intellectual property right, we could in some
    circumstances be enjoined from providing certain products or
    services to our customers or from utilizing and benefiting from
    certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade
    secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to
    enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or
    implement a costly work around. Any of these scenarios could
    have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
    operations.

New
    and Impending Compensation and Corporate Governance Regulations
    Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining
    Management and Other Employees with the Talent and Experience to
    Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively

The compensation and corporate governance practices of financial
    institutions have become and will continue to be subject to
    increasing regulation and scrutiny. Dodd-Frank includes new
    requirements that will affect our corporate governance and
    compensation practices, including some that have resulted in (or
    are likely to lead to) shareholders having the limited right to
    use MetLife, Inc.’s proxy statement to solicit proxies to
    vote for their own candidates for director, impose additional
    requirements for membership on Board committees, requirements
    for additional shareholder votes on compensation matters,
    requirements for policies to recover compensation previously
    paid to certain executives under certain circumstances,
    elimination of broker discretionary voting on compensation
    matters, requirements for additional performance and
    compensation disclosure, and other requirements. See
    “— Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our
    Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth.” In addition, the Federal Reserve Board,
    the FDIC and other U.S. bank regulators have released
    guidelines on incentive compensation that may apply to or impact
    MetLife, Inc. as a bank holding company. These requirements and
    restrictions, and others Congress or regulators may propose or
    implement, could hinder or prevent us from attracting and
    retaining management and other employees with the talent and
    experience to manage and conduct our business effectively.

Although AIG has received assurances from the Troubled Asset
    Relief Program Special Master for Executive Compensation that
    neither we nor ALICO will be subject to compensation related
    requirements and restrictions under programs established in
    whole or in part under EESA, there can be no assurance that the
    Acquisition will not lead to greater public or governmental
    scrutiny, regulation, or restrictions on our compensation
    practices as a result of the Acquisition and expansion into new
    markets outside the U.S., whether in connection with AIG’s
    having received U.S. government funding or as a result of
    other factors.

Legislative
    and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee
    Benefits Could Increase the Costs or Administrative Burdens of
    Providing Benefits to Our Employees or Hinder or Prevent Us From
    Attracting and Retaining Employees, or Affect our Profitability
    As a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical
    Health Insurance Benefit Products

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law
    on March 23, 2010, and The Health Care and Education
    Reconciliation Act of 2010, signed into law on March 30,
    2010 (together, the “Health Care Act”), may



lead to fundamental changes in the way that employers, including
    us, provide health care benefits, other benefits, and other
    forms of compensation to their employees and former employees.
    Among other changes, and subject to various effective dates, the
    Health Care Act generally restricts certain limits on benefits,
    mandates coverage for certain kinds of care, extends the
    required coverage of dependent children through age 26,
    eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations,
    requires cost reporting and, in some cases, requires premium
    rebates to participants under certain circumstances, limits
    coverage waiting periods, establishes several penalties on
    employers who fail to offer sufficient coverage to their
    full-time employees, and requires employers under certain
    circumstances to provide employees with vouchers to purchase
    their own health care coverage. The Health Care Act also
    provides for increased taxation of “high cost”
    coverage, restricts the tax deductibility of certain
    compensation paid by health insurers, reduces the tax
    deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of any
    retiree prescription drug benefit subsidy provided to the
    employer by the federal government, increases Medicare taxes on
    certain high earners, and establishes health insurance
    “exchanges” for individual purchases of health
    insurance.

The impact of the Health Care Act on us as an employer and on
    the benefit plans we sponsor for employees or retirees and their
    dependents, whether those benefits remain competitive or
    effective in meeting their business objectives, and our costs to
    provide such benefits and our tax liabilities in connection with
    benefits or compensation, cannot be predicted. Furthermore, we
    cannot predict the impact of choices that will be made by
    various regulators, including the U.S. Treasury, the IRS, the
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and state
    regulators, to promulgate regulations or guidance, or to make
    determinations under or related to the Health Care Act. Either
    the Health Care Act or any of these regulatory actions could
    adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate
    talented associates. They could also result in increased or
    unpredictable costs to provide employee benefits, and could harm
    our competitive position if we are subject to fees, penalties,
    tax provisions or other limitations in the Health Care Act and
    our competitors are not.

The Health Care Act also imposes requirements on us as a
    provider of non-medical health insurance benefit products,
    subject to various effective dates. It also imposes requirements
    on the purchasers of certain of these products and has
    implications for certain other MLIC products, such as annuities.
    We cannot predict the impact of the Act or of regulations,
    guidance or determinations made by various regulators, on the
    various products that we offer. Either the Health Care Act or
    any of these regulatory actions could adversely affect our
    ability to offer certain of these products in the same manner as
    we do today. They could also result in increased or
    unpredictable costs to provide certain products, and could harm
    our competitive position if the Health Care Act has a disparate
    impact on our products compared to products offered by our
    competitors.

The Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries
    and Pension Relief Act of 2010 also includes certain provisions
    for defined benefit pension plan funding relief. These
    provisions may impact the likelihood

and/or

timing of corporate plan sponsors terminating their plans

and/or

engaging in transactions to partially or fully transfer pension
    obligations to an insurance company. As part of our Corporate
    Benefit Funding segment, we offer general account and separate
    account group annuity products that enable a plan sponsor to
    transfer these risks, often in connection with the termination
    of defined benefit pension plans. Consequently, this legislation
    could indirectly affect the mix of our business, with fewer
    closeouts and more non-guaranteed funding products, and
    adversely impact our results of operations.

Changes
    in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and
    State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity
    Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability

Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to
    insurance products that are also “securities,”
    including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
    policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries
    and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance
    contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under
    these securities laws. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and
    variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts
    are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act. Other
    subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as



broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, and are members of and
    subject to regulation by FINRA. Further, some of our
    subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC
    under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and are also
    registered as investment advisers in various states, as
    applicable.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to
    protect investors in the securities markets, as well as protect
    investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and
    regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking
    and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict
    the conduct of business for failure to comply with the
    securities laws and regulations. A number of changes have
    recently been suggested to the laws and regulations that govern
    the conduct of our variable insurance products business and our
    distributors that could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations. For example,
    Dodd-Frank authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct
    applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized
    investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard
    of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer
    without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker
    or dealer providing the advice. Further, proposals have been
    made that the SEC establish a self-regulatory organization with
    respect to registered investment advisers, which could increase
    the level of regulatory oversight over such investment advisers.

In addition, state insurance regulators are becoming more active
    in adopting and enforcing suitability standards with respect to
    sales of annuities, both fixed and variable. In particular, the
    NAIC has adopted a revised Suitability in Annuity Transactions
    Model Regulation (“SAT”), that will, if enacted by the
    states, place new responsibilities upon issuing insurance
    companies with respect to the suitability of annuity sales,
    including responsibilities for training agents. Several states
    have already enacted laws based on the SAT.

We also may be subject to similar laws and regulations in the
    foreign countries in which we offer products or conduct other
    activities similar to those described above. See
    “Business — International Regulation.”

Changes
    in Tax Laws, Tax Regulations, or Interpretations of Such Laws or
    Regulations Could Increase Our Corporate Taxes; Changes in Tax
    Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to
    Consumers

Changes in tax laws, Treasury and other regulations promulgated
    thereunder, or interpretations of such laws or regulations could
    increase our corporate taxes. The Obama Administration has
    proposed corporate tax changes. Changes in corporate tax rates
    could affect the value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities. Furthermore, the value of deferred tax assets could
    be impacted by future earnings levels.

Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less
    attractive to consumers. A shift away from life insurance and
    annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products would reduce
    our income from sales of these products, as well as the assets
    upon which we earn investment income. The Obama Administration
    has proposed certain changes to individual income tax rates and
    rules applicable to certain policies.

We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting
    corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted, what the
    specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether, if at
    all, any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
    to Regulations Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    of 1974 Could Adversely Affect Our Distribution Model by
    Restricting Our Ability to Provide Customers With
    Advice

The prohibited transaction rules of ERISA and the Internal
    Revenue Code generally restrict the provision of investment
    advice to ERISA plans and participants and Individual Retirement
    Accounts (“IRAs”) if the investment recommendation
    results in fees paid to the individual advisor, his or her firm
    or their affiliates that vary according to the investment
    recommendation chosen. In March 2010, the DOL issued proposed
    regulations which provide limited relief from these investment
    advice restrictions. If the proposed rules are issued in final
    form and no additional relief is provided regarding these
    investment advice restrictions, the ability of our affiliated
    broker-dealers and their registered representatives to provide
    investment advice to ERISA plans and participants, and with
    respect to IRAs, would likely be significantly restricted. Also,
    the fee and revenue arrangements of certain advisory



programs may be required to be revenue neutral, resulting in
    potential lost revenues for these broker-dealers and their
    affiliates.

Other proposed regulatory initiatives under ERISA also may
    negatively impact the current business model of our
    broker-dealers. In particular, the DOL issued a proposed
    regulation in October 2010 that would, if adopted as proposed,
    significantly broaden the circumstances under which a person or
    entity providing investment advice with respect to ERISA plans
    or IRAs would be deemed a fiduciary under ERISA or the Internal
    Revenue Code. If adopted, the proposed regulations may make it
    easier for the DOL in enforcement actions, and for
    plaintiffs’ attorneys in ERISA litigation, to attempt to
    extend fiduciary status to advisors who would not be deemed
    fiduciaries under current regulations.

In addition, the DOL has issued a number of regulations recently
    that increase the level of disclosure that must be provided to
    plan sponsors and participants, and may issue additional such
    regulations in 2011. These ERISA disclosure requirements will
    likely increase the regulatory and compliance burden upon
    MetLife, resulting in increased costs.

We May
    Be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
    Products

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. In addition, there is competition for
    representatives with other types of financial services firms,
    such as independent broker-dealers.

We compete with other insurers for sales representatives
    primarily on the basis of our financial position, support
    services and compensation and product features. We continue to
    undertake several initiatives to grow our career agency force
    while continuing to enhance the efficiency and production of our
    existing sales force. We cannot provide assurance that these
    initiatives will succeed in attracting and retaining new agents.
    Sales of individual insurance, annuities and investment products
    and our results of operations and financial condition could be
    materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in
    attracting and retaining agents. See “Business —
    Competition.”

MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors May Control the Outcome of
    Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions
    of the MetLife Policyholder Trust

Under the Plan, we established the MetLife Policyholder Trust
    (the “Trust”) to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc.
    common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving
    cash or policy credits under the plan. As of February 18,
    2011, the Trust held 220,255,199 shares, or 22.3%, of the
    outstanding shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock. Because of the
    number of shares held in the Trust and the voting provisions of
    the Trust, the Trust may affect the outcome of matters brought
    to a stockholder vote.

Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions
    described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of
    common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the
    recommendations given by MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to its stockholders or, if the Board gives no such
    recommendations, as directed by the Board. As a result of the
    voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may be
    able to control votes on matters submitted to a vote of
    stockholders, excluding those fundamental corporate actions, so
    long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common
    stock.

If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified
    in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the
    Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in
    proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions
    include:

•

an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has
    properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a
    nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    or a vote on a stockholder’s proposal to oppose a Board
    nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a
    vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders,
    subject to certain conditions;



•

a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
    substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or
    dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of
    stockholders under applicable Delaware law;

•

any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion
    of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities
    or other property; and

•

any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to amend or redeem the rights under MetLife, Inc.’s
    stockholder rights plan, other than a proposal with respect to
    which we have received advice of nationally-recognized legal
    counsel to the effect that the proposal is not a proper subject
    for stockholder action under Delaware law. MetLife, Inc. does
    not currently have a stockholder rights plan.

If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions,
    the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by
    the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which
    will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually
    given by Trust beneficiaries.

ALICO Holdings has agreed to vote all shares of MetLife, Inc.
    common stock acquired by it in connection with the Acquisition
    in proportion to the votes cast by all other stockholders of
    MetLife, Inc., including the Trust.

State
    Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our
    By-Laws May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business
    Combinations that Stockholders Might Consider in Their Best
    Interests

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
    delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders
    might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may
    prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium
    over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence
    of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
    takeover attempts in the future.

Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would
    face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or
    prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc.
    might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance
    laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife,
    Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or
    impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws
    prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance
    company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance
    regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is
    presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns,
    directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that
    insurance company or its parent company. We are also subject to
    banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to
    additional regulations. Dodd-Frank contains provisions that
    could restrict or impede consolidation, mergers and acquisitions
    by systemically significant firms

and/or

large
    bank holding companies. See “Business — U.S.
    Regulation — Financial Holding Company
    Regulation — Change of Control and Restrictions on
    Mergers and Acquisitions.” In addition, the Investment
    Company Act would require approval by the contract owners of our
    variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of
    any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying
    our variable contracts. Finally, FINRA approval would be
    necessary for a change of control of any FINRA registered
    broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested
    stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,
    including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional
    shares, for a period of three years following the time that the
    stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An
    “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons
    owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding
    voting stock of a corporation.

MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws
    also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a
    takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best
    interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include:
    classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into
    three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings
    by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of
    candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals
    to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority
    voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of
    the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.



The
    Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May
    Adversely Affect the Level of Claim Losses We Incur and the
    Value of Our Investment Portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the U.S. and
    abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened
    security measures in response to these types of threats may
    cause significant volatility in global financial markets and
    result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions
    to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in
    our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines
    in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity
    caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We cannot predict
    whether, and the extent to which, companies in which we maintain
    investments may suffer losses as a result of financial,
    commercial or economic disruptions, or how any such disruptions
    might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or
    principal on their securities or mortgage loans. The continued
    threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance
    prices and reduced insurance coverage and potentially cause us
    to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were
    able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist actions
    also could disrupt our operations centers in the U.S. or abroad.
    In addition, the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in
    higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated. See
    “— Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital
    Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely
    Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These
    Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future.”

The
    Occurrence of Events Unanticipated in Our Disaster Recovery
    Systems and Management Continuity Planning Could Impair Our
    Ability to Conduct Business Effectively

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
    epidemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus,
    a terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our
    disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to conduct business and on our results of
    operations and financial position, particularly if those
    problems affect our computer-based data processing,
    transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable
    data. We depend heavily upon computer systems to provide
    reliable service. Despite our implementation of a variety of
    security measures, our computer systems could be subject to
    physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from
    unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a
    significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event
    of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could
    be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere
    with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods and services
    and our employees’ ability to perform their job
    responsibilities.

Our
    Associates May Take Excessive Risks Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Financial Condition and Business

As an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of being paid
    to accept certain risks. The associates who conduct our
    business, including executive officers and other members of
    management, sales managers, investment professionals, product
    managers, sales agents, and other associates, do so in part by
    making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk.
    These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines
    and standards, product design and pricing, determining what
    assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which
    business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. Although
    we endeavor, in the design and implementation of our
    compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our
    associates incentives to take excessive risks, associates may
    take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation
    programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls
    and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business
    decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks, there can
    be no assurance that these controls and procedures are or may be
    effective. If our associates take excessive risks, the impact of
    those risks could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or business operations.

Item 2.

Properties

In 2006, we signed a lease for approximately
    410,000 rentable square feet on 12 floors in an office
    building in Manhattan, New York. The term of that lease
    commenced during 2008 and continues for 21 years. In August
    2009, we subleased 32,000 rentable square feet of that
    space to a subtenant, which has met our standards of review with
    respect to creditworthiness, and we currently have approximately
    34,000 rentable square feet of space available for
    sublease. We moved certain operations from our Long Island City,
    Queens facility, to the Manhattan space in late 2008, but
    continue to maintain an on-going presence in Long Island City.
    Our lease in Long Island City covers 686,000 rentable
    square feet under a long-term lease arrangement that commenced
    during 2003 and continues for 20 years. In connection with
    the move of certain operations to Manhattan, in late 2008, we
    subleased 330,000 rentable square feet to four subtenants,
    each of which has met our standards of review with respect to
    creditworthiness. To date, with our occupancy and the four
    subtenants we have secured, we are fully subscribed at the Long
    Island City location.

In connection with the 2005 sale of the 200 Park Avenue
    property, we have retained rights to existing signage and are
    leasing space for associates in the property for 20 years
    with optional renewal periods through 2205.

We continue to own 15 other buildings in the U.S. that we
    use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain
    approximately four million rentable square feet and are located
    in the following states: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois,
    Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and
    Rhode Island. Our computer center in Rensselaer, New York is not
    owned in fee but rather is occupied pursuant to a long-term
    ground lease. We lease space in approximately 700 other
    locations throughout the U.S., and these leased facilities
    consist of 8.9 million rentable square feet. Approximately
    50% of these leases are occupied as sales offices for the
    U.S. Business operations. The balance of space is utilized
    for MetLife Bank and other corporate functions supporting
    business activities. We also own over 70 properties outside the
    U.S., comprised of 10 significant properties and the balance of
    condominium units. We lease approximately 1,200 sites in various
    locations outside the U.S. Of the aforementioned
    international locations, approximately 70 owned sites and
    approximately 700 leased sites were acquired recently in
    connection with the Acquisition. We believe that these
    properties are suitable and adequate for our current and
    anticipated business operations.

We arrange for property and casualty coverage on our properties,
    taking into consideration our risk exposures and the cost and
    availability of commercial coverages, including deductible loss
    levels. In connection with the renewal of those coverages, we
    have arranged $700 million of property insurance, including
    coverage for terrorism, on our real estate portfolio through
    May 15, 2011, its renewal date.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

For purposes of this discussion, “MetLife,” the
    “Company,” “we,” “our” and
    “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation
    incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding Company”), its
    subsidiaries and affiliates. Following this summary is a
    discussion addressing the consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition of the Company for the periods indicated.
    This discussion should be read in conjunction with “Note
    Regarding Forward Looking Statements,” “Risk
    Factors,” “Selected Financial Data” and the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements included
    elsewhere herein.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate
    by reference information that includes or is based upon
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements give expectations or forecasts of future events.
    These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not
    relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words
    such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms
    of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
    operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
    statements relating to future actions, prospective services or
    products, future performance



or results of current and anticipated services or products,
    sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as
    legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results.
    Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.
    Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or
    implied in the forward-looking statements. See “Note
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

The following discussion includes references to our performance
    measures operating earnings and operating earnings available to
    common shareholders, that are not based on accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America
    (“GAAP”). Operating earnings is the measure of segment
    profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and
    allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance
    for segment reporting, is our measure of segment performance.
    Operating earnings is also a measure by which our senior
    management’s and many other employees’ performance is
    evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation
    under applicable compensation plans. Operating earnings is
    defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of
    income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders,
    which is used to evaluate the performance of Banking,
    Corporate & Other, as well as MetLife, is defined as
    operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.

Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net
    investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses);
    (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net
    investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses);
    (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment; (iv) plus income from
    discontinued real estate operations; (v) less net
    investment income related to contractholder-directed unit-linked
    investments; and (vi) plus, for operating joint ventures
    reported under the equity method of accounting, the
    aforementioned adjustments, those identified in the definition
    of operating expenses and changes in the fair value of hedges of
    operating joint venture liabilities, all net of income tax.

Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less
    changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value
    fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder
    liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities;
    (ii) less costs related to business combinations (since
    January 1, 2009) and noncontrolling interests;
    (iii) less amortization of deferred policy acquisition
    costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired
    (“VOBA”) and changes in the policyholder dividend
    obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net
    derivative gains (losses); (iv) less interest credited to
    policyholder account balances (“PABs”) related to
    contractholder-directed unit-linked investments; and
    (v) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivatives that are hedges of PABs but do not qualify for hedge
    accounting treatment.

In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not
    reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities
    that are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as
    required under GAAP.

We believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating
    earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for
    management purposes enhances the understanding of our
    performance by highlighting the results of operations and the
    underlying profitability drivers of our businesses. Operating
    earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders
    should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP income (loss) from
    continuing operations, net of income tax. Reconciliations of
    operating earnings and operating earnings available to common
    shareholders to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations,
    net of income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP measure,
    are included in “— Results of Operations.”

In this discussion, we sometimes refer to sales activity for
    various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to
    revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of
    business activity.

Executive
    Summary

MetLife is a leading global provider of insurance, annuities and
    employee benefit programs throughout the United States
    (“U.S.”), Japan, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe
    and the Middle East. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates,
    MetLife offers life insurance, annuities, auto and homeowners
    insurance, retail banking and other financial services to
    individuals, as well as group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions. MetLife is organized into
    five segments: Insurance Products, Retirement Products,
    Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home
    (collectively, “U.S. Business”) and
    International. The assets and liabilities of American Life
    Insurance Company (“American Life”) and Delaware
    American Life Insurance Company (“DelAm,” together
    with American Life, collectively, “ALICO”) as of
    November 30, 2010 and



the operating results of ALICO from November 1, 2010 (the
    “Acquisition Date”) through November 30, 2010 are
    included in the International segment. In addition, the Company
    reports certain of its results of operations in Banking,
    Corporate & Other, which is comprised of MetLife Bank,
    National Association (“MetLife Bank”) and other
    business activities. For reporting periods beginning in 2011,
    our

non-U.S. Business

results will be presented within two separate segments: Japan
    and Other International Regions.

On the Acquisition Date, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of American Life from ALICO Holdings LLC
    (“ALICO Holdings”), a subsidiary of American
    International Group, Inc. (“AIG”), and DelAm from AIG,
    (the “Acquisition”) for a total purchase price of
    $16.4 billion. The business acquired in the Acquisition
    provides consumers and businesses with life insurance, accident
    and health insurance, retirement and wealth management
    solutions. This transaction delivers on our global growth
    strategies, adding significant scale and reach to MetLife’s
    international footprint, furthering our diversification in
    geographic mix and product offerings, as well as increasing our
    distribution strength. See Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

As the U.S. and global financial markets continue to
    recover, we have experienced a significant improvement in net
    investment income and favorable changes in net investment and
    net derivative gains (losses). We also continue to experience an
    increase in market share and sales in some of our businesses, in
    part, from a flight to quality in the industry. These positive
    factors were somewhat dampened by the negative impact of general
    economic conditions, including high levels of unemployment, on
    the demand for certain of our products.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2009

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of
    income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax
    increased $5.1 billion to a gain of $2.8 billion from
    a loss of $2.3 billion in 2009, of which $2 million in
    losses is from the inclusion of ALICO results for one month in
    2010 and the impact of financing costs for the Acquisition. The
    change was predominantly due to a $4.6 billion favorable
    change in net derivative gains (losses), before income tax, and
    a $2.5 billion favorable change in net investment gains
    (losses), before income tax. Offsetting these favorable
    variances were unfavorable changes in adjustments related to
    continuing operations of $1.3 billion, before income tax,
    and $2.2 billion of income tax, resulting in a total
    favorable variance of $3.6 billion. In addition, operating
    earnings available to common shareholders increased
    $1.5 billion to $3.9 billion in the current year from
    $2.4 billion in the prior year.

The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of
    $3.0 billion was primarily driven by net gains on
    freestanding derivatives in the current year compared to net
    losses in the prior year, partially offset by an unfavorable
    change in embedded derivatives from gains in the prior year to
    losses in the current year. The favorable change in freestanding
    derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors,
    including falling long-term and mid-term interest rates, a
    stronger recovery in equity markets in the prior year than the
    current year, equity volatility, which decreased more in the
    prior year as compared to the current year, a strengthening
    U.S. dollar and widening corporate credit spreads in the
    financial services sector. The favorable change in net
    investment gains (losses) of



$1.6 billion was primarily driven by a decrease in
    impairments and a decrease in the provision for credit losses on
    mortgage loans. These favorable changes in net derivative and
    net investment gains (losses) were partially offset by an
    unfavorable change of $514 million in related adjustments.

The improvement in the financial markets, which began in the
    second quarter of 2009 and continued into 2010, was a key driver
    of the $1.5 billion increase in operating earnings
    available to common shareholders. Such market improvement was
    most evident in higher net investment income and policy fees, as
    well as a decrease in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs.
    These increases were partially offset by an increase in
    amortization of DAC, VOBA and deferred sales inducements
    (“DSI”) as a result of an increase in average separate
    account balances and higher current year gross margins in the
    closed block driven by increased investment yields and the
    impact of dividend scale reductions. The 2010 period also
    includes one month of ALICO results, contributing
    $114 million to the increase in operating earnings. The
    favorable impact of a reduction in discretionary spending
    associated with our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue
    enhancement initiative was more than offset by an increase in
    other expenses related to our International business. This
    increase primarily stemmed from the impact of a benefit recorded
    in the prior year related to the pesification in Argentina, as
    well as current year business growth in the segment.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of
    income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax,
    decreased $5.8 billion to a loss of $2.3 billion from
    income of $3.5 billion in the comparable 2008 period. The
    year over year change is predominantly due to an
    $8.8 billion unfavorable change in net derivative gains
    (losses), before income tax, to losses of $4.9 billion in
    2009 from gains of $3.9 billion in 2008. In addition, there
    was an $808 million unfavorable change in net investment
    gains (losses), before income tax. Offsetting these variances
    were favorable changes in adjustments related to continuing
    operations of $947 million, before income tax, and
    $3.2 billion of income tax, resulting in a total
    unfavorable variance of $5.5 billion. In addition,
    operating earnings available to common shareholders decreased by
    $329 million to $2.4 billion in 2009 from
    $2.7 billion in 2008.

The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of
    $8.8 billion was primarily driven by losses on freestanding
    derivatives, partially offset by gains on embedded derivatives,
    most of which were associated with variable annuity minimum
    benefit guarantees, and lower losses on fixed maturity
    securities. The unfavorable change in net investment gains
    (losses) of $808 million was primarily driven by an
    increase in impairments. These unfavorable changes in gains
    (losses) were partially offset by a favorable change of
    $947 million in related adjustments.

The positive impact of business growth and favorable mortality
    in several of our businesses was more than offset by a decline
    in net investment income, resulting in a decrease in operating
    earnings of $329 million. The decrease in net investment
    income caused significant declines in the operating earnings of
    many of our businesses, especially the interest spread
    businesses. Also contributing to the decline in operating
    earnings was an increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs
    and a charge related to our closed block of business, a specific
    group of participating life policies that were segregated in
    connection with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life
    Insurance Company (“MLIC”). The favorable impact of
    our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative, was more than offset by higher pension and
    postretirement benefit costs, driving the increase in other
    expenses. The declines in operating earnings were partially
    offset by a change in amortization related to DAC, DSI and
    unearned revenue.

Consolidated
    Company Outlook

As a result of the Acquisition, operations outside the
    U.S. are expected to contribute approximately 30% of the
    premiums, fees and other revenues and approximately 40% of
    MetLife’s operating earnings in 2011.



In 2010, general economic conditions improved and interest rates
    remained low throughout the year. In 2011, we expect a
    significant improvement in the operating earnings of the
    Company, driven primarily by the following:

•

Premiums, fees and other revenues growth in 2011 of
    approximately 30%, of which 27% is directly attributable to the
    Acquisition. The remaining 3% increase is driven by:

•

Increases in our

non-U.S. businesses

from continuing organic growth throughout our various geographic
    regions;

•

Higher fees earned on separate accounts, as the equity markets
    continue to improve, thereby increasing the value of those
    separate accounts. In addition, net flows of variable annuities
    are expected to continue to be strong in 2011, which also
    increases the account values upon which these fees are earned;

•

Increased sales in the pension closeout business, both in the
    U.S. and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), as we
    expect the demand for these products to return to a more normal
    level in 2011.

•

Focus on disciplined underwriting. We see no significant changes
    to the underlying trends that drive underwriting results and
    anticipate solid results in 2011.

•

Focus on expense management. We continue to focus on expense
    control throughout the Company, specifically managing the costs
    associated with the integration of ALICO. We also expect to
    begin realizing cost synergies later in 2011.

•

Returns on investment portfolio. Although the market
    environment remains challenging, we expect the returns on our
    investment portfolio in 2011, with respect to both income and
    realized gains and losses, will be in line with the results
    achieved in 2010.

More difficult to predict is the impact of potential changes in
    fair value of freestanding and embedded derivatives as even
    relatively small movements in market variables, including
    interest rates, equity levels and volatility, can have a large
    impact on the fair value of derivatives and net derivative gains
    (losses). Additionally, changes in fair value of embedded
    derivatives within certain insurance liabilities may have a
    material impact on net derivative gains (losses) related to the
    inclusion of an adjustment for nonperformance risk.

Industry
    Trends

Despite improvement in general economic conditions in 2010, we
    continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and
    economic environment that has been affecting the industry.

Financial and Economic Environment.

Our
    business and results of operations are materially affected by
    conditions in the global capital markets and the economy,
    generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.
    The global economy and markets are now recovering from a period
    of significant stress that began in the second half of 2007 and
    substantially increased through the first quarter of 2009. This
    disruption adversely affected the financial services industry,
    in particular. The U.S. economy entered a recession in late
    2007. This recession ended in mid-2009, but the recovery from
    the recession has been below historic averages and the
    unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time. In
    addition, inflation has fallen over the last several years and
    is expected to remain at low levels for some time. Some
    economists believe that some level of disinflation and deflation
    risk remains in the economy.

Throughout 2008 and continuing in 2009, Congress, the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”), the U.S. Treasury and other
    agencies of the Federal government took a number of increasingly
    aggressive actions (in addition to continuing a series of
    interest rate reductions that began in the second half of
    2007) intended to provide liquidity to financial
    institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor confidence
    in particular troubled institutions, to prevent or contain the
    spread of the financial crisis and to spur economic growth. Most
    of these programs have run their course or have been
    discontinued. The monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board
    and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
    Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which was signed by President
    Obama in July 2010, are more likely to be relevant to MetLife,
    Inc. and will significantly change financial regulation in the
    U.S. See “— Regulatory Changes.” In
    addition, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking
    Supervision announced in December 2010 increased capital and
    liquidity requirements (commonly referred



to as “Basel III”) for bank holding companies, such as
    MetLife, Inc. Assuming these requirements are endorsed and
    adopted by the U.S., they are to be phased in beginning
    January 1, 2013. It is possible that even more stringent
    capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed under
    Dodd-Frank and Basel III.

It is not certain what effect the enactment of Dodd-Frank or
    Basel III will have on the financial markets, the
    availability of credit, asset prices and MetLife’s
    operations. We cannot predict whether the funds made available
    by the U.S. Federal government and its agencies will be
    enough to continue stabilizing or to further revive the
    financial markets or, if additional amounts are necessary,
    whether Congress will be willing to make the necessary
    appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would be
    towards any such appropriations, or what additional requirements
    or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional
    funds.

The imposition of additional regulation on large financial
    institutions may have, over time, the effect of supporting some
    aspects of the financial services industry more than others.
    This could adversely affect our competitive position.

Although the disruption in the global financial markets has
    moderated, not all such markets are functioning normally, and
    some remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity.
    The global recession and disruption of the financial markets has
    also led to concerns over capital markets access and the
    solvency of certain European Union member states, including
    Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. In response, on
    May 10, 2010, the European Union, the European Central Bank
    and the International Monetary Fund announced a rescue package
    of up to €750 billion, or approximately $1 trillion,
    for European nations in the Eurozone. This rescue package is
    intended to stabilize these economies. The Japanese economy, to
    which we face increased exposure as a result of the Acquisition,
    continues to experience low nominal growth, a deflationary
    environment, and weak consumer spending.

Recent global economic conditions have had and could continue to
    have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in
    the financial services industry, including MetLife. Such global
    economic conditions, as well as the global financial markets,
    continue to impact our net investment income, our net investment
    and net derivative gains (losses), and the demand for and the
    cost and profitability of certain of our products, including
    variable annuities and guarantee benefits. See
    ‘‘— Results of Operations” and
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the
    turbulence in financial markets that began in the second half of
    2007, its impact on the capital position of many competitors,
    and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have
    highlighted financial strength as a significant differentiator
    from the perspective of customers and certain distributors. In
    addition, the financial market turbulence and the economic
    recession have led many companies in our industry to re-examine
    the pricing and features of the products they offer and may lead
    to consolidation in the life insurance industry.

Regulatory Changes.

The U.S. life
    insurance industry is regulated at the state level, with some
    products and services also subject to Federal regulation. As
    life insurers introduce new and often more complex products,
    regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new
    reserving standards for the life insurance industry. Regulations
    recently adopted or currently under review can potentially
    impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the
    industry. In addition, regulators have undertaken market and
    sales practices reviews of several markets or products,
    including equity-indexed annuities, variable annuities and group
    products. The regulation of the financial services industry in
    the U.S. and internationally has received renewed scrutiny
    as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets in 2008
    and 2009. Significant regulatory reforms have been proposed and
    these or other reforms could be implemented. See
    “Business — U.S. Regulation” and
    “Business — International Regulation.” We
    cannot predict whether any such reforms will be adopted, the
    form they will take or their effect upon us. We also cannot
    predict how the various government responses to the recent
    financial and economic difficulties will affect the financial
    services and insurance industries or the standing of particular
    companies, including us, within those industries. See
    “Business — Governmental



Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions,” “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth” and “Risk Factors — Changes in
    U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and
    State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity
    Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability.” Until various studies are completed and
    final regulations are promulgated pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the
    full impact of Dodd-Frank on the investments, investment
    activities and insurance and annuity products of the Company
    remain unclear. See “Risk Factors — Various
    Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations,
    Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.” Under Dodd-Frank, as a large, interconnected bank
    holding company with assets of $50 billion or more, or
    possibly as an otherwise systemically important financial
    company, MetLife, Inc. will be subject to enhanced prudential
    standards imposed on systemically significant financial
    companies. Enhanced standards will be applied to Tier 1 and
    total risk-based capital (“RBC”), liquidity, leverage
    (unless another, similar standard is appropriate for the
    Company), resolution plan and credit exposure reporting,
    concentration limits, and risk management. The so-called
    “Volcker Rule” provisions of Dodd-Frank restrict the
    ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions (such
    as MetLife Bank) to engage in proprietary trading or sponsor or
    invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. See “Risk
    Factors — Various Aspects of

Dodd-Frank

Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures.

In
    2008 MetLife Bank acquired certain assets to enter the forward
    and reverse residential mortgage origination and servicing
    business, including rights to service residential mortgage
    loans. At various times since then, including most recently in
    the third quarter of 2010, MetLife Bank has acquired additional
    residential mortgage loan servicing rights. As an originator and
    servicer of mortgage loans, which are usually sold to an
    investor shortly after origination, MetLife Bank has obligations
    to repurchase loans upon demand by the investor due to
    (i) a determination that material representations made in
    connection with the sale of the loans (relating, for example, to
    the underwriting and origination of the loans) are incorrect or
    (ii) defects in servicing of the loan. MetLife Bank is
    indemnified by the sellers of the acquired assets, for various
    periods depending on the transaction and the nature of the
    claim, for origination and servicing deficiencies that occurred
    prior to MetLife Bank’s acquisition, including
    indemnification for any repurchase claims made from investors
    who purchased mortgage loans from the sellers. Substantially all
    mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) that were acquired
    by MetLife Bank relate to loans sold to Federal National
    Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) or Federal Home Loan
    Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). Since the 2008
    acquisitions, MetLife Bank has originated and sold mortgages
    primarily to FNMA, FHLMC and Government National Mortgage
    Association (“GNMA”) (collectively, the “Agency
    Investors”) and, to a limited extent, a small number of
    private investors. Currently 99% of MetLife Bank’s
    $83 billion servicing portfolio is comprised of products
    sold to Agency Investors. Other than repurchase obligations
    which are subject to indemnification by sellers of acquired
    assets as described above, MetLife Bank’s exposure to
    repurchase obligations and losses related to origination
    deficiencies is limited to the approximately $52 billion of
    loans originated by MetLife Bank (all of which have been
    originated since August 2008) and to servicing deficiencies
    after the date of acquisition, and management is satisfied that
    adequate provision has been made in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable repurchase obligations and losses.

In light of recent events concerning foreclosure proceedings
    within the industry, MetLife Bank has undertaken a close review
    of its procedures. MetLife Bank verifies the accuracy of
    borrower information included in affidavits filed in foreclosure
    proceedings. We do not believe that MetLife Bank has material
    exposure to potential losses arising from challenges to its
    foreclosure procedures. Like other mortgage servicers, MetLife
    Bank has been the subject of recent inquiries and investigations
    from state attorneys general and banking regulators. See
    Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Summary
    of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
    requires management to adopt accounting policies and make
    estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the
    consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates
    include those used in determining:

(i)

the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted
    market values;

(ii)

investment impairments;



(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investment entities and the
    application of the consolidation rules to certain investments;

(iv)

the estimated fair value of and accounting for freestanding
    derivatives and the existence and estimated fair value of
    embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;

(v)

the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment
    and amortization of VOBA;

(vi)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(vii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits and the
    accounting for reinsurance contracts;

(viii)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(ix)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(x)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to aforementioned critical
    accounting estimates. In applying the Company’s accounting
    policies, we make subjective and complex judgments that
    frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently
    uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related
    judgments are common in the insurance and financial services
    industries; others are specific to the Company’s businesses
    and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Fair
    Value

The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
    exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. In many cases, the exit
    price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at
    initial recognition. However, in certain cases, the transaction
    price may not represent fair value. The fair value of a
    liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer
    a liability to a third party with the same credit standing. It
    requires that fair value be a market-based measurement in which
    the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction
    at the measurement date, considered from the perspective of a
    market participant. When quoted prices are not used to determine
    fair value of an asset, the Company considers three broad
    valuation techniques: (i) the market approach,
    (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost approach.
    The Company determines the most appropriate valuation technique
    to use, given what is being measured and the availability of
    sufficient inputs. The Company prioritizes the inputs to fair
    valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable
    inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
    The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at
    estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the
    priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.
    The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability’s
    classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
    lowest level of input to its valuation. The input levels are as
    follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other significant inputs that are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as



instruments for which the determination of estimated fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation.

Prior to January 1, 2009, the measurement and disclosures
    of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially
    measured at estimated fair value in a business combination,
    reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first
    step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for
    impairment assessment.

In addition, the Company elected the fair value option
    (“FVO”) for certain of its financial instruments to
    better match measurement of assets and liabilities in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Estimated
    Fair Value of Investments

The Company’s investments in fixed maturity and equity
    securities, investments in trading and other securities, certain
    short-term investments, most mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

and MSRs are reported at their estimated fair value. In
    determining the estimated fair value of these investments,
    various methodologies, assumptions and inputs are utilized, as
    described further below.

When available, the estimated fair value of securities is based
    on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and
    regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of
    the Company’s securities holdings and valuation of these
    securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include,
    but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing of the
    issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon
    rate, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity,
    estimated duration and management’s assumptions regarding
    liquidity and estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, the
    estimated fair values are based on available market information
    and management’s judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

is determined based on observable pricing of residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted to convert
    the securities prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market
    prices are not available. When observable pricing for similar
    loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not
    available, the estimated fair values of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgage loans have also been
    designated as

held-for-sale

which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated
    fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an
    individual loan basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is
    determined using independent broker quotations or, when the loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
    estimated using internal models.



MSRs, which are recorded in other invested assets, are measured
    at estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated
    from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the
    servicing rights are retained by the Company. The estimated fair
    value of MSRs is principally determined through the use of
    internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various
    assumptions. Valuation inputs and assumptions include generally
    observable items such as type and age of loan, loan interest
    rates, current market interest rates, and certain unobservable
    inputs, including assumptions regarding estimates of discount
    rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs, all of which are
    sensitive to changing markets conditions. The use of different
    valuation assumptions and inputs, as well as assumptions
    relating to the collection of expected cash flows, may have a
    material effect on the estimated fair values of MSRs.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

Investment
    Impairments

One of the significant estimates related to

available-for-sale

securities is the evaluation of investments for impairments. The
    assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of severity

and/or

age
    of the gross unrealized loss, as described more fully in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a
    fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability
    of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal
    payments and the Company’s evaluation of recoverability of
    all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount
    at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value
    of the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast,
    for certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration
    are given by the Company to a decline in estimated fair value
    and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will
    recover.

Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the
    security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates
    about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings
    potential. Considerations used by the Company in the impairment
    evaluation process include, but are not limited to:

(i)

the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair
    value has been below cost or amortized cost;

(ii)

the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties;

(iii)

the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv)

the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed
    geographic locations;

(v)

the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer,
    series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type
    of loss or has exhausted natural resources;

(vi)

with respect to fixed maturity securities, whether the Company
    has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required
    to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in
    estimated fair value below cost or amortized cost;

(vii)

with respect to equity securities, whether the Company’s
    ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount
    equal to or greater than cost;

(viii)

unfavorable changes in projected cash flows on mortgage-backed
    and asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and

(ix)

other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.



The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    the credit loss component of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment (“OTTI”) in the period in which the
    determination is made. When an OTTI of a fixed maturity security
    has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings
    depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or
    more likely than not will be required to sell the security
    before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below
    amortized cost. If the fixed maturity security meets either of
    these two criteria, the OTTI recognized in earnings is equal to
    the entire difference between the security’s amortized cost
    and its estimated fair value at the impairment measurement date.
    For OTTI of fixed maturity securities that do not meet either of
    these two criteria, the net amount recognized in earnings is
    equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed
    maturity security and the present value of projected future cash
    flows expected to be collected from this security (“credit
    loss”). If the estimated fair value is less than the
    present value of projected future cash flows expected to be
    collected, this portion of OTTI related to other than credit
    factors (“noncredit loss”) is recorded as other
    comprehensive income (loss). For equity securities, the carrying
    value of the equity security is impaired to its estimated fair
    value, with a corresponding charge to earnings. The Company does
    not make any adjustments for subsequent recoveries in value.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on
    other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based
    upon the Company’s periodic evaluation and assessment of
    known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset
    class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as
    conditions change and new information becomes available.

Recognition
    of Income on Certain Investment Entities

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and ABS,
    certain structured investment transactions, trading and other
    securities) is dependent upon market conditions, which could
    result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned.

Application
    of the Consolidation Rules to Certain Investments

The Company has invested in certain structured transactions that
    are VIEs. These structured transactions include reinsurance
    trusts, asset-backed securitizations, hybrid securities, real
    estate joint ventures, other limited partnership interests and
    limited liability companies. The Company is required to
    consolidate those VIEs for which it is deemed to be the primary
    beneficiary. The accounting rules for the determination of when
    an entity is a VIE and when to consolidate a VIE are complex.
    The determination of the VIE’s primary beneficiary requires
    an evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and
    obligations associated with each party’s relationship with
    or involvement in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s
    expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation
    of such estimates to each party involved in the entity. The
    Company generally uses a qualitative approach to determine
    whether it is the primary beneficiary.

For most VIEs, the entity that has both the ability to direct
    the most significant activities of the VIE and the obligation to
    absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to
    the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary. However, for VIEs
    that are investment companies or apply measurement principles
    consistent with those utilized by investment companies, the
    primary beneficiary is based on a risks and rewards model and is
    defined as the entity that will absorb a majority of a
    VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority of a VIE’s
    expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority
    of expected losses, or both. The Company reassesses its
    involvement with VIEs on a quarterly basis. The use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of
    the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions
    including swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts to
    manage various risks relating to its ongoing business
    operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to synthetically
    replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily
    available in the cash market.



The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through
    the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives
    and interest forwards to sell certain to-be-announced securities
    or through the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

(“OTC”) derivatives. The determination of estimated
    fair value, when quoted market values are not available, is
    based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that
    are assumed to be consistent with what other market participants
    would use when pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations
    can be affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads, default risk
    (including the counterparties to the contract), volatility,
    liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the
    pricing models. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional details on significant
    inputs into the OTC derivative pricing models and credit risk
    adjustment.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under such accounting guidance. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and
    measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are
    also subject to interpretations and estimations and different
    interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the
    amount reported in net income.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefits. These include guaranteed minimum
    withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum
    accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), and certain guaranteed
    minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). GMWB, GMAB and
    certain GMIB are embedded derivatives, which are measured at
    estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity
    product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net
    derivative gains (losses).

The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are
    determined based on the present value of projected future
    benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The
    projections of future benefits and future fees require capital
    market and actuarial assumptions including expectations
    concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the
    guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. The valuation of these
    embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for the
    Company’s nonperformance risk and risk margins for
    non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance risk adjustment is
    determined by taking into consideration publicly available
    information relating to spreads in the secondary market for the
    Holding Company’s debt, including related credit default
    swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary,
    to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims
    paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to
    the Holding Company. Risk margins are established to capture the
    non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the
    additional compensation a market participant would require to
    assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial
    assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial
    withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins
    requires the use of significant management judgment.

The accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and
    interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to
    evolve in practice. If interpretations change, there is a risk
    that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation
    and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated
    financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair
    value could materially affect net income.

These guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than
    expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market
    conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest
    rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency
    exchange rates, changes in the Company’s nonperformance
    risk, variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder
    behavior, mortality and risk margins related to non-capital
    market inputs may result in significant fluctuations in the
    estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially
    affect net income.



The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the
    embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a
    methodology consistent with that described previously for the
    guarantees directly written by the Company.

As part of its regular review of critical accounting estimates,
    the Company periodically assesses inputs for estimating
    nonperformance risk in fair value measurements. During the
    second quarter of 2010, the Company completed a study that
    aggregated and evaluated data, including historical recovery
    rates of insurance companies as well as policyholder behavior
    observed over the past two years as the recent financial crisis
    evolved. As a result, at the end of the second quarter of 2010,
    the Company refined the manner in which its insurance
    subsidiaries incorporate expected recovery rates into the
    nonperformance risk adjustment for purposes of estimating the
    fair value of investment-type contracts and embedded derivatives
    within insurance contracts. The refinement impacted the
    Company’s income from continuing operations, net of income
    tax, with no effect on operating earnings.

As described above, the valuation of variable annuity guarantees
    accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for
    the Company’s nonperformance risk, which is subject to
    variability. The table below illustrates the impact that a range
    of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, excluding the
    effect of income tax. Changes in the carrying values of PABs
    would be reported in net investment gains (losses) and changes
    in the carrying value of DAC and VOBA would be reported in other
    expenses. However, these estimated effects do not take into
    account potential changes in other variables, such as equity
    price levels and market volatility, that can also contribute
    significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the
    table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the
    consolidated financial statements under the credit spread
    variance scenarios presented below.

In determining the ranges, the Company has considered current
    market conditions as well as the market level of spreads that
    can reasonably be anticipated over the near term. The ranges do
    not reflect extreme market conditions experienced during the
    2008 and 2009 economic crisis as the Company does not consider
    those to be reasonably likely events in the near future.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is
    determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for the
    Company’s nonperformance risk that takes into consideration
    publicly available information relating to the Company’s
    debt, as well as its claims paying ability. Changes in equity
    and bond indices, interest rates and the Company’s credit
    standing may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the
    fair value of these embedded derivatives that could materially
    affect net income.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair
    value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type
    contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair
    value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially
    determined projections, by each block of business, of future
    policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity,
    separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses,
    investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other
    factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary
    from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the consolidated financial
    statements for reporting purposes.



Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the Company’s accounting policy
    relating to DAC and VOBA amortization for various types of
    contracts.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. The Company’s practice to
    determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on
    separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity
    markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is
    only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. The
    Company monitors these events and only changes the assumption
    when its long-term expectation changes. The effect of an
    increase/(decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed
    future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a
    decrease/(increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization of
    approximately $128 million with an offset to the
    Company’s unearned revenue liability of approximately
    $19 million for this factor.

The Company also periodically reviews other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. We
    annually update assumptions used in the calculation of estimated
    gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed.
    If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross
    margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will
    decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.

The Company’s most significant assumption updates resulting
    in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the
    amortization of DAC and VOBA were due to revisions to expected
    future investment returns, expenses, in-force or persistency
    assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included
    within the Insurance Products and Retirement Products segments.
    The Company expects these assumptions to be the ones most
    reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future.
    Changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the Company
    is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over
    time.

Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements provides a rollforward of DAC and VOBA for the
    Company for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, as well as a breakdown of DAC and VOBA by segment and
    reporting unit at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

At December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, DAC and VOBA for the
    Company was $27.3 billion, $19.3 billion and
    $20.1 million, respectively. The DAC and VOBA balance
    increased significantly as a result of the Acquisition, which
    contributed $8.9 billion to the balance at
    December 31, 2010. Approximately 55%, of the Company’s
    DAC and VOBA was associated with the Insurance Products and
    Retirement Products segments at December 31, 2010. At
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, DAC and VOBA for these
    segments was $14.9 billion, $16.1 billion and
    $17.4 billion, respectively. Amortization of DAC and VOBA
    associated with the variable and universal life and the
    annuities contracts within the Insurance Products and Retirement
    Products segments is significantly impacted by movements in
    equity markets. The following chart illustrates the effect on
    DAC and VOBA within the Company’s U.S. Business of
    changing each of the respective assumptions, as well as updating
    estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or
    profits during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as
    presented below, resulted in a corresponding decrease (increase)
    in amortization.

The following represents significant items contributing to the
    changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2010:

•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities, resulting in an increase of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $197 million, excluding the impact from the
    Company’s nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are
    described below. This increase in actual gross profits was
    partially offset by freestanding derivative losses associated
    with the hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted
    in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $88 million.

The narrowing of the Company’s nonperformance risk
    adjustment increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities,
    decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $96 million. In addition, higher risk
    margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations,
    decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $18 million.

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses),
    which increased DAC amortization by $129 million, was
    primarily attributable to current period investment activities.

•

Included in policyholder dividends and other was an increase in
    DAC and VOBA amortization of $42 million as a result of
    changes to long-term assumptions. In addition, amortization
    increased by $39 million as a result of favorable gross
    margin variances. The remainder of the increase was due to
    various immaterial items.

The following represents significant items contributing to the
    changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2009:

•

Actual gross profits decreased as a result of increased
    investment losses from the portfolios associated with the
    hedging of guaranteed insurance obligations on variable
    annuities, resulting in a decrease of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $141 million.

•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities, resulting in an increase of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $995 million, excluding the impact from the
    Company’s nonperformance risk and risk margins, which are
    described below. This increase in actual gross profits was
    partially offset by freestanding derivative losses associated
    with the hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted
    in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $636 million.

–

The narrowing of the Company’s nonperformance risk
    adjustment increased the valuation of guarantee liabilities,
    decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $607 million. This was partially offset by
    lower risk margins which decreased the guarantee liability
    valuations, increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and
    VOBA amortization by $20 million.

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses),
    which decreased DAC amortization by $484 million, was
    primarily attributable to current period investment activities.

•

Included in policyholder dividends and other was a decrease in
    DAC and VOBA amortization of $90 million as a result of
    changes to long-term assumptions. The remainder of the decrease
    was due to various immaterial items.

The following represents significant items contributing to the
    changes in DAC and VOBA amortization in 2008:

•

The decrease in equity markets during the year significantly
    lowered separate account balances which led to a significant
    reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal
    life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting
    in an increase of $708 million in DAC and VOBA amortization.



•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities resulting in a reduction of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $1,047 million. This decrease in actual gross profits
    was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with
    the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an
    increase in actual gross profits and an increase in DAC and VOBA
    amortization of $625 million.

–

The widening of the Company’s nonperformance risk
    adjustment decreased the valuation of guarantee liabilities,
    increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $739 million. This was partially offset by
    higher risk margins which increased the guarantee liability
    valuations, decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and
    VOBA amortization by $100 million.

–

Reductions in both actual and expected cumulative earnings of
    the closed block resulting from recent experience in the closed
    block combined with changes in expected dividend scales resulted
    in an increase in closed block DAC amortization of
    $195 million, $175 million of which was related to net
    investment gains (losses).

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses) on
    DAC amortization of $129 million was attributable to
    numerous immaterial items.

•

Increases in DAC and VOBA amortization in 2008 resulting from
    changes in assumptions related to in-force/persistency of
    $159 million were driven by higher than anticipated
    mortality and lower than anticipated premium persistency during
    2008.

The Company’s DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by
    unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of
    amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and
    losses had been recognized. The increase in unrealized
    investment gains decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by
    $1.4 billion in 2010. The decrease in unrealized investment
    losses decreased the DAC and VOBA balance by $2.8 billion
    in 2009, whereas the increase in unrealized investment losses
    increased the DAC and VOBA balance by $3.4 billion in 2008.
    Notes 3 and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements include the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized
    investment losses.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
    there might be an indication of impairment. In such instances,
    the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a
    business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of
    goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be
    recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net
    income.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include
    projected operating earnings, current book value (with and
    without accumulated other comprehensive income), the level of
    economic capital required to support the mix of business,
    long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the
    account value of in-force business, projections of new and
    renewal business, as well as margins on such business, the level
    of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the
    discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective
    reporting unit. The estimated fair values of the retirement
    products and individual life reporting units are particularly
    sensitive to the equity market levels.



We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated
    fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the
    relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated
    fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies
    utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are
    sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently
    uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable
    expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and
    the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based
    will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual
    future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our
    reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future
    periods which could materially adversely affect our results of
    operations or financial position.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate potential triggering events
    that may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units
    to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating
    or adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may
    have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of these
    reporting units and could result in future impairments of
    goodwill.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities, certain accident and health, and
    non-medical health insurance. Generally, amounts are payable
    over an extended period of time and related liabilities are
    calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to
    be paid reduced by the present value of future expected
    premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and
    underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable
    actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the
    establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are
    mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement,
    disability incidence, disability terminations, investment
    returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as
    appropriate to the respective product type and geographical
    area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy
    is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the
    period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these
    assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business
    basis. If experience is less favorable than assumptions,
    additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to
    policyholder benefits and claims.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Other policy-related balances include claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported on life and non-medical health insurance. Liabilities
    for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the Company’s
    historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that
    consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends
    and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage
    and subrogation.

Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income
    benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and
    secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on
    estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the
    projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. Liabilities for universal and variable life
    secondary guarantees and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent
    with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the
    same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment
    performance and volatility for variable products are consistent
    with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity
    index, such as the Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services (“S&P”) 500 Index.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing of these policies and guarantees
    and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in
    variances in profit and could result in losses.



Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties. Accounting for reinsurance requires
    extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related
    to the future performance of the underlying business and the
    potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company
    periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared
    to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and
    liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and
    evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its
    reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated
    in the security impairment process discussed previously.
    Additionally, for each of its reinsurance agreements, the
    Company determines whether the agreement provides
    indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance
    risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The
    Company reviews all contractual features, particularly those
    that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the
    reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely
    reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a
    reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a
    reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance
    risk, the Company records the agreement using the deposit method
    of accounting.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the
    Company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing
    jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company
    provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently
    payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. The Company’s accounting for income taxes
    represents management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company
    anticipates making an election under the Internal Revenue Code
    Section 338 as it relates to the Acquisition. As such, the
    tax basis in the acquired assets and liabilities is adjusted as
    of the Acquisition Date resulting in a change to the related
    deferred income taxes.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not
    be realized. Factors in management’s determination consider
    the performance of the business including the ability to
    generate capital gains. Significant judgment is required in
    determining whether valuation allowances should be established,
    as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such
    determination, consideration is given to, among other things,
    the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is
    recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is measured
    at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The
    Company may be required to change its provision for income taxes
    when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged
    by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining
    valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly
    change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need
    for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future
    events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or
    interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an
    impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax
    rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts
    reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year
    these changes occur.



Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company sponsor

and/or

administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements.
    The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In
    consultation with our external consulting actuarial firms, we
    determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such
    as historical performance of the plan and its assets, currently
    available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout
    streams. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual
    results due to, among other factors, changing market and
    economic conditions and changes in participant demographics.
    These differences may have a significant effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements and liquidity.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including
    the Company’s asbestos-related liability, are especially
    difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data
    and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect
    liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the
    assumptions used to estimate the Company’s asbestos-related
    liability include the number of future claims, the cost to
    resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in
    pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new
    claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the
    law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible
    impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to
    allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the Company when
    exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos
    exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future
    adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual
    basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to
    liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and
    litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. It is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain of the Company’s
    litigation and regulatory investigations, including
    asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in
    the determination of amounts recorded could have a material
    effect upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash
    flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Economic
    Capital

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in our businesses. As a part of the economic
    capital process, a portion of net investment income is credited
    to the segments based on the level of allocated equity. This is
    in contrast to the standardized regulatory RBC formula, which is
    not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the
    nuances of our businesses.

Results
    of Operations

Year
    Ended December 31, 2010 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2009

We have experienced growth and an increase in market share in
    several of our businesses, which, together with improved overall
    market conditions compared to conditions a year ago, positively
    impacted our results most significantly through increased net
    cash flows, improved yields on our investment portfolio and
    increased policy fee income. Sales of our domestic annuity
    products were up 14%, driven by an increase in variable annuity
    sales compared with the prior year. We benefited in 2010 from
    strong sales of structured settlement products. Market
    penetration continues in our pension closeout business in the
    U.K.; however, although improving, our domestic



pension closeout business has been adversely impacted by a
    combination of poor equity returns and lower interest rates.
    High levels of unemployment continue to depress growth across
    our group insurance businesses due to lower covered payrolls.
    While we experienced growth in our group life business, sales of
    non-medical health and individual life products declined. Sales
    of new homeowner and auto policies increased 11% and 4%,
    respectively, as the housing and automobile markets have
    improved. We experienced a 30% increase in sales of retirement
    and savings products abroad. During 2010, mortgage refinancing
    activity continued to return to more moderate levels compared to
    the unusually high levels experienced in 2009.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of

During the year ended December 31, 2010, income (loss) from
    continuing operations, net of income tax increased
    $5.1 billion to a gain of $2.8 billion from a loss of
    $2.3 billion in 2009, of which $2 million in losses
    was from the inclusion of one month of ALICO results in 2010.
    The change was predominantly due to a $3.0 billion
    favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) and a
    $1.6 billion favorable change in net investment gains
    (losses). Offsetting these favorable variances totaling
    $4.6 billion were unfavorable changes in adjustments
    related to net derivative and net investment gains (losses) of
    $514 million, net of income tax, principally associated
    with DAC and



VOBA amortization, resulting in a total favorable variance
    related to net derivative and net investment gains (losses), net
    of related adjustments and income tax, of $4.1 billion.

We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined
    Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”) principles,
    focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and
    future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount
    of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash
    inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing, net
    of income tax, risk-adjusted net investment income and
    risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily
    weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our
    portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage
    loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and
    other characteristics which cause them to be generally well
    suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance
    liabilities. Other invested asset classes including, but not
    limited to, equity securities, other limited partnership
    interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures,
    provide additional diversification and opportunity for long-term
    yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and
    duration objectives of our investment portfolio. We also use
    derivatives as an integral part of our management of the
    investment portfolio to hedge certain risks, including changes
    in interest rates, foreign currencies, credit spreads and equity
    market levels. Additional considerations for our investment
    portfolio include current and expected market conditions and
    expectations for changes within our specific mix of products and
    business segments. In addition, the general account investment
    portfolio includes within trading and other securities,
    contractholder-directed investments supporting unit-linked
    variable annuity type liabilities, which do not qualify for
    reporting and presentation as separate account assets. The
    returns on these investments, which can vary significantly
    period to period include changes in estimated fair value
    subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset
    in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account
    balances through interest credited to policyholder account
    balances.

The composition of the investment portfolio of each business
    segment is tailored to the specific characteristics of its
    insurance liabilities, causing certain portfolios to be shorter
    in duration and others to be longer in duration. Accordingly,
    certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in longer duration,
    higher yielding fixed maturity securities, or certain

sub-sectors

of fixed maturity securities, than other portfolios.

Investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities
    and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However,
    net investment gains and losses are generated and can change
    significantly from period to period, due to changes in external
    influences, including movements in interest rates, foreign
    currencies, credit spreads and equity markets, counterparty
    specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating
    and collateral valuation, and internal factors such as portfolio
    rebalancing, that can generate gains and losses. As an investor
    in the fixed income, equity security, mortgage loan and certain
    other invested asset classes, we are exposed to the above stated
    risks, which can lead to both impairments and credit-related
    losses.

Freestanding derivatives are used to hedge certain investments
    and liabilities. For those hedges not designated as accounting
    hedges, changes in these market risks can lead to the
    recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains
    (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in
    earnings for the item being hedged even though these are
    effective economic hedges. Additionally, we issue liabilities
    and purchase assets that contain embedded derivatives whose
    changes in estimated fair value are sensitive to changes in
    market risks and are also recognized in net derivative gains
    (losses).

The favorable variance in net derivative gains (losses) of
    $3.0 billion, from losses of $3.2 billion in 2009 to
    losses of $172 million in 2010 was primarily driven by a
    favorable change in freestanding derivatives of
    $4.4 billion, comprised of a $4.5 billion favorable
    change from losses in the prior year of $4.3 billion to
    gains in the current year of $203 million and
    $123 million in ALICO freestanding derivative losses. This
    favorable variance was partially offset by an unfavorable change
    in embedded derivatives primarily associated with variable
    annuity minimum benefit guarantees of $1.4 billion from
    gains in the prior year of $1.1 billion to losses in the
    current year of $257 million, net of $5 million in
    ALICO embedded derivative gains.

We use freestanding interest rate, currency, credit and equity
    derivatives to provide economic hedges of certain invested
    assets and insurance liabilities, including embedded
    derivatives, within certain of our variable annuity minimum
    benefit guarantees. The $4.5 billion favorable variance in
    freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market
    factors, including falling long-term and mid-term interest
    rates, a stronger recovery in equity markets in the prior year
    than the current year, a greater decrease in equity volatility
    in the prior year as



compared to the current year, a strengthening U.S. dollar
    and widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services
    sector. Falling long-term and mid-term interest rates in the
    current year compared to rising long-term and mid-term interest
    rates in the prior year had a positive impact of
    $2.6 billion on our interest rate derivatives,
    $931 million of which is attributable to hedges of variable
    annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities, which are
    accounted for as embedded derivatives. In addition, stronger
    equity market recovery and lower equity market volatility in the
    prior year as compared to the current year had a positive impact
    of $1.1 billion on our equity derivatives, which we use to
    hedge variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees.
    U.S. dollar strengthening had a positive impact of
    $554 million on certain of our foreign currency
    derivatives, which are used to hedge foreign-denominated asset
    and liability exposures. Finally, widening corporate credit
    spreads in the financial services sector had a positive impact
    of $221 million on our purchased protection credit
    derivatives.

Certain variable annuity products with minimum benefit
    guarantees contain embedded derivatives that are measured at
    estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity
    contract, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net
    derivative gains (losses). These embedded derivatives also
    include an adjustment for nonperformance risk of the related
    liabilities carried at estimated fair value. The
    $1.4 billion unfavorable change in embedded derivatives was
    primarily attributable to the impact of market factors,
    including falling long-term and mid-term interest rates, changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates, equity volatility and equity
    market movements. Falling long-term and mid-term interest rates
    in the current year compared to rising long-term and mid-term
    interest rates in the prior year had a negative impact of
    $1.4 billion. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates
    had a negative impact of $468 million. Equity volatility
    decreased more in the prior year than in the current year
    causing a negative impact of $284 million, and a stronger
    recovery in the equity markets in the prior year than in the
    current year had a negative impact of $228 million. The
    unfavorable impact from these hedged risks was partially offset
    by a favorable change related to the adjustment for
    nonperformance risk of $1.2 billion, from losses of
    $1.3 billion in 2009 to losses of $62 million in 2010.
    This $62 million loss was net of a $621 million loss
    related to a refinement in estimating the spreads used in the
    adjustment for nonperformance risk made in the second quarter of
    2010. Gains on the freestanding derivatives that hedged these
    embedded derivative risks largely offset the change in
    liabilities attributable to market factors, excluding the
    adjustment for nonperformance risk, which does not have an
    economic impact on the Company.

Improved or stabilizing market conditions across several
    invested asset classes and sectors as compared to the prior year
    resulted in decreases in impairments and in net realized losses
    from sales and disposals of investments in most components of
    our investment portfolio. These decreases, coupled with a
    decrease in the provision for credit losses on mortgage loans
    due to improved market conditions, resulted in a
    $1.6 billion improvement in net investment gains (losses).

Income from continuing operations, net of income tax for 2010
    includes $138 million of expenses related to the
    acquisition and integration of ALICO. These expenses, which
    primarily consisted of investment banking and legal fees, are
    recorded in Banking, Corporate & Other and are not a
    component of operating earnings.

As more fully described in the discussion of performance
    measures above, we use operating earnings, which does not equate
    to income (loss) from continuing operations as determined in
    accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate
    segment performance, and allocate resources. Operating earnings
    is also a measure by which senior management’s and many
    other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purpose
    of determining their compensation under applicable compensation
    plans. We believe that the presentation of operating earnings,
    as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the
    understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of
    operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the
    business. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a
    substitute for GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations,
    net of income tax. Operating earnings available to common
    shareholders increased by $1.5 billion to $3.9 billion
    in 2010 from $2.4 billion in 2009.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of
    income tax and are on a constant currency basis. The constant
    currency basis amounts for both periods are calculated using the
    average foreign currency exchange rates of 2010.

The improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver
    of the increase in operating earnings as evidenced by higher net
    investment income and an increase in average separate account
    balances, which resulted in an increase in policy fee income.
    Interest rate and equity market changes resulted in a decrease
    in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs. Partially
    offsetting this improvement was an increase in amortization of
    DAC, VOBA and DSI. The increase in operating earnings also
    includes the positive impact of changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates in 2010. This improved reported operating
    earnings by $38 million for 2010 compared to 2009.
    Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, operating earnings increased $1.5 billion from the
    prior period. Furthermore, the 2010 period also includes one
    month of ALICO results, contributing $114 million to the
    increase in operating earnings. The current period also
    benefited from the dividend scale reduction in the fourth
    quarter of 2009. The improvement in 2010 results compared to
    2009 was partially offset by a decline in residential mortgage
    loan production and the prior period impact of pesification in
    Argentina.

In addition to a $133 million increase due to the inclusion
    of ALICO results, net investment income increased by
    $792 million from higher yields and $515 million from
    growth in average invested assets. Yields were positively
    impacted by the effects of stabilizing real estate markets and
    recovering private equity markets year over year on real estate
    joint ventures and other limited partnership interests, and by
    the effects of continued repositioning of the accumulated
    liquidity in our portfolio to longer duration and higher
    yielding investments, including investment grade corporate fixed
    maturity securities. Growth in our investment portfolio was
    primarily due to positive net cash flows from growth in our
    domestic individual and group life businesses, as well as
    certain international businesses; increased bank deposits,
    higher cash collateral balances received from our derivative
    counterparties, as well as the temporary investment of proceeds
    from the debt and common stock issuances in anticipation of the
    Acquisition. With the exception of the cash flows from such
    securities issuances, which were temporarily invested in lower
    yielding liquid investments, we continued to reposition the
    accumulated liquidity in our portfolio to longer duration and
    higher yielding investments.

Since many of our products are interest spread-based, higher net
    investment income is typically offset by higher interest
    credited expense. However, interest credited expense, including
    amounts reflected in policyholder benefits and claims, decreased
    $147 million, primarily in our domestic funding agreement
    business, which experienced lower average crediting rates
    combined with lower average account balances. Our fixed
    annuities business also experienced lower crediting rates.
    Certain crediting rates can move consistently with the
    underlying market indices, primarily the London Inter-Bank Offer
    Rate (“LIBOR”), which were lower than the prior year.
    The impact from the growth in our structured settlement,
    long-term care and disability businesses partially offset those
    decreases in interest credited expense.

A significant increase in average separate account balances is
    largely attributable to favorable market performance resulting
    from improved market conditions since the second quarter of 2009
    and positive net cash flows from the annuity business. This
    resulted in higher policy fees and other revenues of
    $471 million, most notably in our Retirement Products
    segment. The improvement in fees is partially offset by greater
    DAC, VOBA and DSI amortization of $377 million. Policy fees
    are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets
    in the separate accounts. DAC, VOBA and DSI amortization is
    based on the earnings of the business, which in the retirement
    business are derived, in part, from fees earned on separate
    account balances. A portion of the increase in amortization was
    due to the impact of higher current year gross margins, a
    primary component in the determination of the amount of
    amortization for our Insurance Products segment, mostly in the
    closed block resulting from increased investment yields and the
    impact of dividend scale reductions.

There was a $59 million decrease in variable annuity
    guaranteed benefit costs. Costs associated with our annuity
    guaranteed benefit liabilities, hedge programs and reinsurance
    programs are impacted by equity markets and interest rate levels
    to varying degrees. While 2010 and 2009 both experienced equity
    market improvements, the improvement in 2009 was greater.
    Interest rate levels declined in the current year and increased
    in the prior year. Annuity guaranteed benefit liabilities, net
    of a decrease in paid claims, increased benefits by
    $93 million primarily from our annual unlocking of
    assumptions related to these liabilities. The hedge and
    reinsurance programs which are used to mitigate the risk
    associated with these guarantees produced losses in both
    periods, but the losses in the



prior period were more significant due to the 2009 equity market
    recovery. The change in hedge and reinsurance program costs
    decreased by $152 million. These hedge and reinsurance
    programs, which are a key part of our risk management strategy,
    performed as anticipated.

The reduction in the dividend scale in the fourth quarter of
    2009 resulted in a $109 million decrease in policyholder
    dividends in the traditional life business in the current period.

Claims experience varied amongst our businesses with a net
    unfavorable impact of $153 million to operating earnings
    compared to the prior year. We had unfavorable claims experience
    in our Auto & Home segment, primarily due to increased
    catastrophes. Our Insurance Products segment experienced mixed
    claims experience with a net unfavorable impact. We experienced
    less favorable mortality experience in our Corporate Benefit
    Funding segment despite favorable experience in our structured
    settlements business.

A $15.2 billion decline in residential mortgage loan
    production resulted in a $131 million decrease in operating
    earnings, $32 million of which is reflected in net
    investment income from lower investment levels with the
    remainder largely attributable to a reduction in fee income. The
    increase in the serviced residential mortgage loan portfolio
    improved operating earnings by $41 million, including
    $23 million of costs associated with investment and growth
    in our banking business as discussed below.

Interest expense increased $64 million primarily as a
    result of the full year impact of debt issuances in 2009 and of
    senior notes and debt securities issued in anticipation of the
    Acquisition, partially offset by the impact of lower interest
    rates on variable rate collateral financing arrangements.

In addition to a $269 million increase associated with the
    Acquisition, operating expenses increased due to the impact of a
    $95 million benefit recorded in the prior period related to
    the pesification in Argentina, as well as an $83 million
    increase related to the investment and growth in our
    international and banking businesses. In addition, the current
    period includes a $14 million increase in charitable
    contributions and $13 million of costs associated with the
    integration of ALICO. Offsetting these increases was a
    $76 million reduction in discretionary spending, such as
    consulting, rent and postemployment related costs. In addition,
    we experienced a $47 million decline in market driven
    expenses, primarily pension and post retirement benefit costs.
    Also contributing to the decrease was a $35 million
    reduction in real estate-related charges and $15 million of
    lower legal costs.

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2010 was
    $1,181 million, or 30% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with income tax
    benefit of $2,015 million, or 47% of the loss from
    continuing operations before benefit for income tax, for the
    comparable 2009 period. The Company’s 2010 and 2009
    effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of
    35% primarily due to the impact of certain permanent tax
    differences, including non-taxable investment income and tax
    credits for investments in low income housing, in relation to
    income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax, as
    well as certain foreign permanent tax differences.

The 2010 period includes $75 million of charges related to
    the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health
    Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the
    “Health Care Act”). The Federal government currently
    provides a Medicare Part D subsidy. The Health Care Act
    reduced the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to
    the extent of any Medicare Part D subsidy received
    beginning in 2013. Because the deductibility of future retiree
    health care costs is reflected in our financial statements, the
    entire future impact of this change in law was required to be
    recorded as a charge in the period in which the legislation was
    enacted. Changes to the provision for income taxes in both
    periods contributed to an increase in operating earnings of
    $86 million for our International segment, resulting from a
    $34 million unfavorable impact in 2009 due to a change in
    assumption regarding the repatriation of earnings and a benefit
    of $52 million in the current year from additional
    permanent reinvestment of earnings, the reversal of tax
    provisions and favorable changes in liabilities for tax
    uncertainties. In addition, in 2009 we had a larger benefit of
    $71 million as compared to 2010 related to the utilization
    of tax preferenced investments which provide tax credits and
    deductions.

The improvement in the global financial markets had a positive
    impact on net investment income, which contributed to the
    increase in Insurance Products’ operating earnings. In
    addition, we experienced overall modest revenue growth in
    several of our businesses despite this challenging environment.
    High levels of unemployment continue to depress growth across
    most of our group insurance businesses due to lower covered
    payrolls. Growth in our group life business was dampened by a
    decline in our non-medical health and individual life
    businesses. However, our dental business benefited from higher
    enrollment and pricing actions, partially offset by lower
    persistency and the loss of existing subscribers, driven by high
    unemployment. This business also experienced more stable
    utilization and benefits costs in the current year. The revenue
    growth from our dental business was more than offset by a
    decline in revenues from our disability business, mainly due to
    net customer cancellations, changes in benefit levels and lower
    covered lives. Our long-term care revenues were flat year over
    year, concurrent with the discontinuance of the sale of this
    coverage at the end of 2010. In our individual life business,
    the change in revenues was suppressed by the impact of a benefit
    recorded in the prior year related to the positive resolution of
    certain legal matters. Excluding this impact, the traditional
    life business experienced 8% growth in our open block of
    business. The expected run-off of our closed block more than
    offset this growth.

The significant components of the $179 million increase in
    operating earnings were an improvement in net investment income
    and the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain
    policyholders, coupled with lower expenses. These improvements
    were partially offset by an increase in DAC amortization, as
    well as net unfavorable claims experience across several of our
    businesses.

Higher net investment income of $295 million was due to a
    $202 million increase from growth in average invested
    assets and a $93 million increase from higher yields.
    Growth in the investment portfolio was attributed to an increase
    in net cash flows from the majority of our businesses. The
    increase in yields was largely due to the positive effects of
    recovering private equity markets and stabilizing real estate
    markets on other limited partnership interests and real estate
    joint ventures. To manage the needs of our intermediate to
    longer-term liabilities, our portfolio consists primarily of
    investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities, mortgage
    loans, structured finance securities (comprised of mortgage and
    asset-backed securities) and U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and, to a lesser
    extent, certain other invested asset classes, including other



limited partnership interests, real estate joint ventures and
    other invested assets which provide additional diversification
    and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement.

The increase in net investment income was partially offset by a
    $36 million increase in interest credited on long duration
    contracts, which is reflected in the change in policyholder
    benefits and dividends, primarily due to growth in future
    policyholder benefits in our long-term care and disability
    businesses.

Other expenses decreased by $82 million, largely due to a
    decrease of $40 million from the impact of market
    conditions on certain expenses, such as pension and
    post-retirement benefit costs. In addition, a decrease in
    information technology expenses of $29 million contributed
    to the improvement in operating earnings. A decrease in variable
    expenses, such as commissions and premium taxes, further reduced
    expenses by $11 million, a portion of which is offset by
    DAC capitalization.

The reduction in the dividend scale in the fourth quarter of
    2009 resulted in a $109 million decrease in policyholder
    dividends in the traditional life business in the current year.

Claims experience varied amongst Insurance Products’
    businesses with a net unfavorable impact of $42 million to
    operating earnings. We experienced excellent mortality results
    in our group life business due to a decrease in severity, as
    well as favorable reserve refinements in the current year. In
    addition, an improvement in our long-term care results was
    driven by favorable claim experience mainly due to higher
    terminations and less claimants in the current year, coupled
    with the impact of unfavorable reserve refinements in the prior
    year. Our improved dental results were driven by higher
    enrollment and pricing actions, as well as improved claim
    experience in the current year. The impact of this positive
    experience was surpassed by solid, but less favorable mortality,
    in our individual life business combined with higher incidence
    and severity of group disability claims in the current year, and
    the impact of a gain from the recapture of a reinsurance
    arrangement in the prior year.

Higher DAC amortization of $157 million was primarily
    driven by the impact of higher gross margins, a primary
    component in the determination of the amount of amortization,
    mostly in the closed block resulting from increased investment
    yields and the impact of dividend scale reductions. In addition,
    the net impact of various model refinements in both the prior
    and current year increased DAC amortization.

Certain events reduced operating earnings, including the impact
    of a benefit being recorded in the prior year of
    $17 million related to the positive resolution of certain
    legal matters and an increase in current income tax expense of
    $27 million, resulting from an increase in our effective
    tax rate.

During 2010, overall annuity sales decreased 5% compared to 2009
    as declines in fixed annuity sales were partially offset by
    increased sales of our variable annuity products. The financial
    market turmoil in early 2009 resulted in extraordinarily high
    sales of fixed annuity products in 2009. The high sales level
    was not expected to continue after the financial markets
    returned to more stable levels. Variable annuity product sales
    increased primarily due to the expansion of alternative
    distribution channels and fewer competitors in the market place.
    Surrender rates for both our variable and fixed annuities
    remained low during the current period as we believe our
    customers continue to value our products compared to other
    alternatives in the marketplace.

Interest rate and equity market changes were the primary driver
    of the $431 million increase in operating earnings, with
    the largest impact resulting from a $370 million increase
    in policy fees and other revenues, a $193 million increase
    in net investment income, and a $59 million decrease in
    variable annuity guarantee benefit costs, offset by a
    $204 million increase in DAC, VOBA and DSI amortization and
    a $39 million increase in commission expense resulting from
    growth in annuity contract balances.

A significant increase in average separate account balances was
    largely attributable to favorable market performance resulting
    from improved market conditions since the second quarter of 2009
    and positive net cash flows from the annuity business. This
    resulted in higher policy fees and other revenues of
    $370 million, partially offset by greater DAC, VOBA and DSI
    amortization. Policy fees are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in the separate account. DAC,
    VOBA and DSI amortization is based on the earnings of the
    business, which in the retirement business are derived, in part,
    from fees earned on separate account balances.

Financial market improvements also resulted in the increase in
    net investment income of $193 million as a
    $291 million increase from higher yields was partially
    offset by a $98 million decrease from a decline in average
    invested assets. Yields were positively impacted by the effects
    of the continued repositioning of the accumulated liquidity in
    our investment portfolio to longer duration and higher yielding
    assets, including investment grade corporate fixed maturity
    securities. Yields were also positively impacted by the effects
    of recovering private equity markets and stabilizing real estate
    markets on other limited partnership interests and real estate
    joint ventures. Despite positive net cash flows, a reduction in
    the general account investment portfolio was due to the impact
    of



more customers gaining confidence in the equity markets and, as
    a result, electing to transfer funds into our separate account
    investment options as market conditions improved. To manage the
    needs of our intermediate to longer-term liabilities, our
    investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade
    corporate fixed maturity securities, structured finance
    securities, mortgage loans and U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and, to a lesser
    extent, certain other invested asset classes, including other
    limited partnership interests, real estate joint ventures and
    other invested assets, in order to provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement.

There was a $59 million decrease in variable annuity
    guaranteed benefit costs in 2010 compared to 2009. Costs
    associated with our annuity guaranteed benefit liabilities,
    hedge programs and reinsurance programs are impacted by equity
    markets and interest rate levels to varying degrees. While the
    equity market improved in both 2010 and 2009, the improvement in
    2009 was greater. Interest rate levels declined in the current
    year and increased in the prior year. Annuity guaranteed benefit
    liabilities, net of a decrease in paid claims, increased
    benefits by $93 million primarily from our annual unlocking
    of assumptions related to these liabilities. The hedge and
    reinsurance programs which are used to mitigate the risk
    associated with these guarantees produced losses in both
    periods, but the losses in the prior period were more
    significant due to the 2009 equity market recovery. The costs
    related to our hedge and reinsurance programs decreased by
    $152 million in 2010 compared to 2009. These hedge and
    reinsurance programs, which are a key part of our risk
    management strategy, performed as anticipated.

Interest credited expense decreased $49 million driven by
    lower average crediting rates on fixed annuities and higher
    amortization of excess interest reserve due to one large case
    surrender in 2010, partially offset by growth in our fixed
    annuity policyholder account balances.

Corporate Benefit Funding benefited in 2010 from strong sales of
    structured settlement products and continued market penetration
    of our pension closeout business in the U.K. However, structured
    settlement premiums have declined $174 million, before
    income tax, from 2009 reflecting extraordinary sales in the
    fourth quarter of 2009. While market penetration continued in
    our pension closeout business in the U.K. as the number of sold
    cases



increased, the average premium has declined, resulting in a
    decrease in premiums of $216 million, before income tax.
    Although improving, a combination of poor equity returns and
    lower interest rates have contributed to pension plans remaining
    underfunded, both in the U.S. and in the U.K., which
    reduces our customers’ flexibility to engage in
    transactions such as pension closeouts. For each of these
    businesses, the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset
    by the related change in policyholder benefits. The insurance
    liability that is established at the time we assume the risk
    under these contracts is typically equivalent to the premium
    recognized.

The $340 million increase in operating earnings was
    primarily driven by an improvement in net investment income and
    the impact of lower crediting rates, partially offset by the
    impact of prior period favorable liability refinements and less
    favorable mortality.

The primary driver of the $340 million increase in
    operating earnings was higher net investment income of
    $278 million, reflecting a $187 million increase from
    higher yields and a $91 million increase in average
    invested assets. Yields were positively impacted by the effects
    of stabilizing real estate markets and recovering private equity
    markets on real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnership interests. These improvements in yields were
    partially offset by decreased yields on fixed maturity
    securities due to the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities
    and sales during this lower interest rate environment. Growth in
    the investment portfolio is due to an increase in average
    policyholder account balances and growth in the securities
    lending program. To manage the needs of our longer-term
    liabilities, our portfolio consists primarily of investment
    grade corporate fixed maturity securities, structured finance
    securities, mortgage loans and U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed securities, and, to a lesser extent,
    certain other invested asset classes including other limited
    partnership interests, real estate joint ventures and other
    invested assets in order to provide additional diversification
    and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement. For our
    short-term obligations, we invest primarily in structured
    finance securities, mortgage loans and investment grade
    corporate fixed maturity securities. The yields on these
    short-term investments have moved consistently with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR and
    U.S. Treasury, on which they are based.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, changes in
    net investment income are typically offset by a corresponding
    change in interest credited expense. However, interest credited
    expense decreased $122 million, primarily related to our
    funding agreement business as a result of lower average
    crediting rates combined with lower average account balances.
    Certain crediting rates can move consistently with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR, which were lower
    than the prior year. Interest credited expense related to the
    structured settlement businesses increased $40 million as a
    result of the increase in the average policyholder liabilities.

Mortality experience was mixed and reduced operating earnings in
    2010 by $26 million. Less favorable mortality in our
    pension closeouts and corporate owned life insurance businesses
    compared to 2009 was only slightly offset by favorable mortality
    experience in our structured settlements business.

Liability refinements in both the current and prior year
    resulted in a $28 million decrease to operating earnings.
    These were largely offset by the impact of a charge in the 2009
    period related to a refinement of a reinsurance recoverable in
    the small business recordkeeping business which increased
    operating earnings by $20 million.

The improving housing and automobile markets have provided
    opportunities that led to increased new business sales for both
    homeowners and auto policies in 2010. Sales of new policies
    increased 11% for our homeowners business and 4% for our auto
    business in 2010 compared to 2009. Average premium per policy
    also improved in 2010 over 2009 in our homeowners businesses but
    remained flat in our auto business.

The primary driver of the $22 million decrease in operating
    earnings was unfavorable claims experience, partially offset by
    higher net investment income and increased premiums.

Catastrophe-related losses increased by $58 million
    compared to 2009 due to increases in both the number and
    severity of storms. Current period claim costs decreased
    $19 million as a result of lower frequencies in both our
    auto and homeowners businesses; however, this was partially
    offset by a $13 million increase in claims due to higher
    severity in our homeowners business. Also contributing to the
    decline in operating earnings was an increase of $7 million
    in loss adjusting expenses, primarily related to a decrease in
    our unallocated loss adjusting expense liabilities at the end of
    2009.

The impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the
    unfavorable change in the combined ratio, including
    catastrophes, increasing to 94.6% in 2010 from 92.3% in 2009 and
    the favorable change in the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, decreasing to 88.1% in 2010 from 88.9% in 2009.

A $19 million increase in net investment income partially
    offset the declines in operating earnings discussed above. Net
    investment income was higher primarily as a result of an
    increase in average invested assets, including changes in
    allocated equity, partially offset by a decrease in yields. This
    portfolio is comprised primarily of high quality municipal bonds.

The increase in average premium per policy in our homeowners
    businesses improved operating earnings by $10 million as
    did an increase in exposures which improved operating earnings
    by $1 million. Exposures are primarily each automobile for
    the auto line of business and each residence for the property
    line of business. Also improving operating earnings, through an
    increase in premiums, was a $5 million reduction in
    reinsurance costs.

The slight increase in other expenses was more than offset by an
    $8 million increase in DAC capitalization, resulting
    primarily from increased premiums written.

In addition, a first quarter 2010 write-off of an equity
    interest in a mandatory state underwriting pool required by a
    change in legislation and a decrease in income from a
    retroactive reinsurance contract in run-off, both of which



were recorded in other revenues, drove a $7 million
    decrease in operating earnings. Auto & Home also
    benefited from a lower effective tax rate which improved
    operating earnings by $8 million primarily as a result of
    tax free interest income representing a larger portion of
    pre-tax income.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of
    income tax and are on a constant currency basis. The constant
    currency basis amounts for both periods are calculated using the
    average foreign currency exchange rates for 2010.

The improvement in the global financial markets has resulted in
    continued growth, with a 24% increase in sales in the current
    period compared to the prior period excluding the results of our
    Japan joint venture. Retirement and savings sales increased 30%
    driven by strong annuity, universal life and pension sales in
    Europe, Mexico, Chile, South Korea and China. In our Europe and
    the Middle East operations, sales of annuities and universal
    life products remained strong, more than doubling from the prior
    year, partially offset by lower pension and variable universal
    life sales in India due to the loss of a major distributor, as
    well as lower credit life sales. Our Latin America operation
    experienced an overall increase in sales resulting from solid
    growth in pension and universal life sales in Mexico and an
    increase in fixed annuity sales in Chile due to market recovery,
    slightly offset by lower bank sales in Brazil resulting from
    incentives offered in the prior year. Sales in our Asia Pacific
    operation, excluding the results of our Japan joint venture,
    increased primarily due to higher variable universal life sales
    in South Korea, slightly offset by the decline in annuity sales
    and strong bank channel sales in China. We have experienced
    lower sales in Taiwan following the announcement of the planned
    sale of this business. While the third party’s application
    for approval of the sale of our Taiwan affiliate was rejected by
    the Taiwan Financial Supervising Commission, the Company
    continues to explore strategic options with respect to this
    affiliate.

Reported operating earnings increased by $329 million over
    the prior year. The positive impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates improved reported earnings by
    $38 million for 2010 compared to 2009. Excluding the impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, operating
    earnings increased $291 million, or 58%. Reported operating
    earnings reflect the operating results of ALICO from the
    Acquisition Date through November 30, 2010, which
    contributed $114 million to our 2010 operating earnings. As
    previously noted,



ALICO’s accounting year-end is November 30; therefore,
    International’s results for the year include one month of
    ALICO results.

Changes in assumptions for measuring the impact of inflation on
    certain inflation-indexed fixed maturity securities increased
    operating earnings by $124 million. Changes to the
    provision for income taxes in both periods contributed to an
    increase in operating earnings of $86 million, resulting
    from a $34 million unfavorable impact in 2009 from a change
    in assumption regarding the repatriation of earnings and a
    benefit $52 million in the current year from additional
    permanent reinvestment of earnings, the reversal of tax
    provisions and favorable changes in liabilities for tax
    uncertainties. Business growth in our Latin America operation
    contributed to an increase in operating earnings. Operating
    earnings in Mexico increased $56 million from growth in our
    institutional and individual businesses, partially offset by the
    impact of unfavorable claims experience of $26 million.
    Higher investment yields resulting from portfolio restructuring
    was the primary driver in Argentina contributing
    $23 million to the improvement in operating earnings.
    India’s results benefited by $10 million primarily due
    to lower expenses resulting from the loss of a major distributor
    and slower growth resulting from market conditions.

Partially offsetting these increases is the impact of
    pesification in Argentina, which favorably impacted 2009
    reported earnings by $95 million. This prior period benefit
    was due to a liability release resulting from a reassessment of
    our approach in managing existing and potential future claims
    related to certain social security pension annuity
    contractholders in Argentina. In addition, operating earnings in
    Australia were lower by $9 million, which was primarily due
    to a write-off of DAC attributable to a change in a product
    feature in the current period.

In addition to a $133 million increase due to the inclusion
    of ALICO results, net investment income increased
    $102 million from growth in average invested assets and
    $88 million from improved yields. Growth in average
    invested assets reflects growth in our businesses. Improved
    yields reflects the impact of increased inflation, primarily in
    Chile, as well as the impact of changes in assumptions for
    measuring the effects of inflation on certain inflation-indexed
    fixed maturity securities. The increase in net investment income
    from higher inflation was offset by an increase in the related
    insurance liabilities due to higher inflation. Although
    diversification into higher yielding investments had a positive
    impact on yields, this was partially offset by decreased trading
    and other securities results driven by a stronger recovery in
    equity markets in 2009 compared to 2010, primarily in Hong Kong,
    and by a decrease in the results of our operating joint
    ventures. The reduction in net investment income from our
    trading portfolio is entirely offset by a corresponding decrease
    in the interest credited on the related contractholder account
    balances and therefore had no impact on operating earnings.

In addition to a $269 million increase associated with the
    Acquisition, operating expenses increased due to the impact of
    the pesification in Argentina noted above, as well as current
    period business growth in South Korea, Brazil and Mexico, which
    resulted in $93 million of increased commissions and
    compensation. These increases were partially offset by
    $33 million of lower commissions and business expenses in
    India.

During 2010, mortgage refinancing activity continued to return
    to more moderate levels compared to the unusually high levels
    experienced in 2009. Consistent with these market conditions, we
    experienced a $15.2 billion decline in residential mortgage
    production during 2010, while our serviced residential mortgage
    loans increased $20.1 billion, which includes a
    $16.5 billion purchase from a FDIC receivership bank in the
    third quarter of 2010 and a net sale of $4.8 billion to
    FNMA in the second quarter of 2010. Servicing run-off of
    existing business slowed to 18.2% in 2010 compared with 19.6% in
    2009.

The Holding Company completed four debt financings in August
    2010 in anticipation of the Acquisition, issuing
    $1.0 billion of 2.375% senior notes, $1.0 billion
    of 4.75% senior notes, $750 million of
    5.875% senior notes, and $250 million of floating rate
    senior notes. The Holding Company also issued debt securities,
    which are part of the $3.0 billion stated value of common
    equity units. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used
    to finance the Acquisition. The Holding Company completed three
    debt issuances in 2009 in response to the economic crisis,
    issuing $397 million of floating rate senior notes in March
    2009, $1.3 billion of senior notes in May 2009, and
    $500 million of junior subordinated debt securities in July
    2009. The proceeds from these debt issuances were used for
    general corporate purposes.

Operating earnings available to common shareholders and
    operating earnings, which excludes preferred stock dividends,
    each increased $270 million, primarily due to an increase
    in net investment income and a reduction in operating expenses,
    partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues, a
    decrease in tax benefit and an increase in interest expense
    resulting from the debt issuances noted above.

Net investment income increased $335 million reflecting an
    increase of $189 million due to higher yields and an
    increase of $146 million from growth in average invested
    assets. Yields were positively impacted by the effects of
    recovering private equity markets and stabilizing real estate
    markets on other limited partnership interests and real estate
    joint ventures. This was partially offset by lower fixed
    maturities yields which were adversely impacted by the
    reinvestment of proceeds from maturities and sales during this
    lower interest rate environment and from decreased trading and
    other securities results due to a stronger recovery in equity
    markets in 2009 as compared to 2010. In addition, due to the
    lower interest rate environment in the current year, less net
    investment income was credited to the segments in 2010 compared
    to 2009. Growth in average invested assets was primarily due to
    an



increase in bank deposits, higher cash collateral balances
    received from our derivative counterparties and the temporary
    investment of the proceeds from the debt and common stock
    issuances in anticipation of the Acquisition. Our investments
    primarily include structured finance securities, investment
    grade corporate fixed maturities, mortgage loans and
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed fixed
    maturity securities. In addition, our investment portfolio
    includes the excess capital not allocated to the segments.
    Accordingly, it includes a higher allocation of certain other
    invested asset classes to provide additional diversification and
    opportunity for long-term yield enhancement, including leveraged
    leases, other limited partnership interests, real estate, real
    estate joint ventures, trading securities and equity securities.

Banking, Corporate & Other benefited in 2010 from a
    $76 million reduction in discretionary spending, such as
    consulting and postemployment related costs, a $35 million
    decrease in real estate-related charges and $15 million of
    lower legal costs. Other expenses also include a
    $48 million decrease in commissions as a result of the
    decline in residential mortgage loan production discussed below.
    These savings were partially offset by a $14 million
    increase in charitable contributions. The current year also
    included $44 million of internal resource costs for
    associates committed to the Acquisition and a $23 million
    increase in expenses associated with expanding the
    infrastructure of our banking business. Additionally, the
    positive resolution of certain legal matters increased operating
    earnings by $27 million.

The $15.2 billion decline in residential mortgage loan
    production resulted in a $131 million decrease in operating
    earnings, $32 million of which is reflected in net
    investment income with the remainder largely attributable to a
    reduction in fee income. The increase in the serviced
    residential mortgage loan portfolio improved operating earnings
    by $41 million despite the increased infrastructure
    expenses discussed above.

Maturing time deposits and the need for liquidity in the lower
    interest rate environment of 2010 resulted in a $17 million
    decrease in interest credited to bank deposits, despite growth
    of $1.7 billion in deposits.

Interest expense increased $64 million primarily as a
    result of the debt issuances in 2009 and the senior notes and
    debt securities issued in anticipation of the Acquisition,
    partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on
    variable rate collateral financing arrangements.

The 2010 period includes $75 million of charges related to
    the Health Care Act. The Federal government currently provides a
    Medicare Part D subsidy. The Health Care Act reduced the
    tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of
    any Medicare Part D subsidy received beginning in 2013.
    Because the deductibility of future retiree health care costs is
    reflected in our financial statements, the entire future impact
    of this change in law was required to be recorded as a charge in
    the period in which the legislation was enacted. As a result, we
    incurred a $75 million charge in the first quarter of 2010.
    The Health Care Act also amended Internal Revenue Code
    Section 162(m) as a result of which MetLife was initially
    considered a healthcare provider, as defined, and would be
    subject to limits on tax deductibility of certain types of
    compensation. In December 2010, the Internal Revenue Service
    issued Notice

2011-2

which
    clarified that the executive compensation deduction limitation
    included in the Health Care Act did not apply to insurers like
    MetLife selling de minimis amounts of health care coverage. As a
    result, in the fourth quarter of 2010, we reversed
    $18 million of previously recorded taxes for 2010. In 2009,
    Banking, Corporate & Other received a larger benefit
    of $36 million as compared to 2010 related to the
    utilization of tax preferenced investments which provide tax
    credits and deductions.

Results
    of Operations

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Unfavorable market conditions continued through 2009, providing
    a challenging business environment. The largest and most
    significant impact continued to be on our investment portfolio
    as declining yields resulted in lower net investment income.
    Market sensitive expenses were also negatively impacted by the
    market conditions as evidenced by an increase in pension and
    postretirement benefit costs. Higher levels of unemployment
    continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in
    covered payrolls reduced growth. Our auto and homeowners
    business was impacted by a declining housing market, the
    deterioration of the new auto sales market and the continuation
    of credit availability issues, all of which contributed to a
    decrease in insured exposures. Despite the challenging business
    environment, revenue growth remained solid in the majority of
    our businesses. A flight to



quality during the year contributed to an improvement in sales
    in both our domestic fixed and variable annuity products. We
    also saw an increase in market share, especially in the
    structured settlement business, where we experienced an increase
    of 53% in premiums. An improvement in the global financial
    markets contributed to a recovery of sales in most of our
    international regions and resulted in improved investment
    performance in some regions during the second half of 2009. We
    also benefited domestically from a strong residential mortgage
    refinance market and healthy growth in the reverse mortgage
    arena.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are net of income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax
    decreased $5.8 billion to a loss of $2.3 billion from
    income of $3.5 billion in the comparable 2008 period. The
    year over year change was predominantly due to a
    $5.7 billion unfavorable change in net derivative gains
    (losses) to losses of $3.2 billion in 2009 from gains of
    $2.5 billion in 2008, and a $525 million unfavorable
    change in net investment gains (losses). Offsetting these
    unfavorable variances totaling $6.2 billion were favorable
    changes in adjustments related to net derivative and net
    investment gains (losses) of $972 million, net of income
    tax, principally associated with DAC and VOBA amortization,
    resulting in a total unfavorable variance related to net
    derivative and net investment gains (losses), net of related
    adjustments and income tax, of $5.2 billion.

We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined ALM
    principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our
    current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the
    timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested
    assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount,
    while optimizing, net of income tax, risk-adjusted net
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment
    portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments,
    with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity
    securities and mortgage loans.



These securities and loans have varying maturities and other
    characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for
    matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.
    Other invested asset classes including, but not limited to
    equity securities, other limited partnership interests and real
    estate and real estate joint ventures provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement
    in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives
    of our investment portfolio. We also use derivatives as an
    integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to
    hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates,
    foreign currencies, credit spreads and equity market levels.
    Additional considerations for our investment portfolio include
    current and expected market conditions and expectations for
    changes within our unique mix of products and business segments.

The composition of the investment portfolio of each business
    segment is tailored to the unique characteristics of its
    insurance liabilities, causing certain portfolios to be shorter
    in duration and others to be longer in duration. Accordingly,
    certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in fixed maturity
    securities, or certain

sub-sectors

of fixed maturity securities, than other portfolios.

Investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities
    and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However,
    net investment gains and losses are generated and can change
    significantly from period to period, due to changes in external
    influences including movements in interest rates, foreign
    currencies and credit spreads, counterparty specific factors
    such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral
    valuation, and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing
    that can generate gains and losses. As an investor in the fixed
    income, equity security, mortgage loan and certain other
    invested asset classes, we are exposed to the above stated
    risks, which can lead to both impairments and credit-related
    losses.

In addition to the above risk management strategies, as an
    integral part of our management of the investment portfolio, we
    use freestanding derivatives to hedge market risks including
    changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, credit spreads
    and the equity market. We also use freestanding derivatives to
    hedge these same risks in certain of our liabilities, including
    variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees. For those hedges
    not designated as an accounting hedge, changes in these market
    risks can lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net
    derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss
    recognized in earnings for the item being hedged even though
    these are effective economic hedges. Additionally, we issue
    liabilities and purchase assets that contain embedded
    derivatives whose changes in estimated fair value are sensitive
    to changes in market risks and are also recognized in net
    derivative gains (losses).

The unfavorable variance in net derivative gains (losses) of
    $5.7 billion, from gains of $2.5 billion in 2008 to
    losses of $3.2 billion in 2009 was primarily driven by an
    unfavorable change in freestanding derivatives of
    $8.6 billion from gains in the prior period of
    $4.3 billion to losses in the current period of
    $4.3 billion. This unfavorable variance was partially
    offset by a favorable change in embedded derivatives primarily
    associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees of
    $2.9 billion from losses in the prior period of
    $1.7 billion to gains in the current period of
    $1.2 billion.

The $8.6 billion unfavorable variance in freestanding
    derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors,
    including rising interest rates, improving equity markets on
    equity options and futures, decreased equity volatility,
    weakening U.S. dollar, and narrowing credit spreads.
    Long-term and mid-term interest rates increased in the current
    period which caused a negative impact of $4.4 billion on
    our interest rate derivatives, $1.2 billion of which is
    attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit
    guarantees. Equity markets improved while equity volatility
    decreased in the current period, which had a net negative impact
    of $3.1 billion on our equity derivatives, which we use to
    hedge variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees. Weakening of
    the U.S. dollar in the current period had a negative impact
    of $646 million on certain foreign currency derivatives
    that are used to hedge foreign-denominated asset and liability
    exposures. Narrowing corporate credit spreads had a negative
    impact of $453 million on our purchased protection credit
    derivatives.

The variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees
    containing embedded derivatives are measured at fair value
    separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes
    in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains
    (losses). The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives
    also includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk of the
    related liabilities carried at estimated fair value. The
    $2.9 billion favorable change in embedded derivatives was
    primarily attributable to rising interest rates, improving
    equity market performance, a decrease in equity volatility, and
    weakening of the U.S. dollar, which was offset by the



unfavorable change in the adjustment for nonperformance risk.
    Both long-term and mid-term interest rates increased in the
    current period which had a positive impact of $2.2 billion.
    Improving equity markets in the current period had a positive
    impact of $1.5 billion. Lower equity market volatility in
    the current period compared to the prior period had a positive
    impact of $817 million, and the weakening U.S. dollar
    had a positive impact of $456 million. The favorable
    results from these hedged risks was partially offset by an
    unfavorable change related to the adjustment for nonperformance
    risk of $3.2 billion, from gains of $1.9 billion in
    2008 to losses of $1.3 billion in 2009. Gains on the
    freestanding derivatives that hedged these embedded derivative
    risks more than offset the change in liabilities attributable to
    market factors, excluding the adjustment for nonperformance
    risk. Finally, there was a favorable change of $1.1 billion
    for all other unhedged risks on the variable annuity minimum
    benefit guarantee liabilities.

The $525 million unfavorable change in net investment gains
    (losses) was primarily attributable to higher net losses on
    mortgage loans and other limited partnership interests. The
    increase in losses on mortgage loans was principally due to
    increases in mortgage valuation allowances resulting from
    weakening of the real estate market and other economic
    fundamentals. The increase in losses on other limited
    partnership interests was principally due to higher impairments
    on certain cost method investments which experienced a reduction
    in net asset values of the underlying portfolio companies. The
    underlying valuations of the portfolio companies have decreased
    due to the current economic environment.

As more fully described in the discussion of performance
    measures above, operating earnings is the measure of segment
    profit or loss we use to evaluate performance and allocate
    resources. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment
    reporting, it is our measure of performance, as reported below.
    Operating earnings is not determined in accordance with GAAP and
    should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income (loss) from
    continuing operations, net of income tax. We believe that the
    presentation of operating earnings enhances the understanding of
    our performance by highlighting the results of operations and
    the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating
    earnings available to common shareholders decreased by
    $329 million to $2.4 billion in 2009 from
    $2.7 billion in 2008.

The volatile market conditions that began in 2008 and continued
    into 2009 impacted several key components of our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders including net
    investment income, hedging costs, and certain market sensitive
    expenses. The markets also positively impacted our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders as conditions began to
    improve during 2009, resulting in lower DAC and DSI amortization.

A $722 million decline in net investment income was the
    result of decreasing yields, including the effects of our higher
    quality, more liquid, but lower yielding investment position in
    response to the extraordinary market conditions. The impact of
    declining yields caused a $1.6 billion decrease in net
    investment income, which was partially offset by an increase of
    $846 million due to growth in average invested assets
    calculated excluding unrealized gains and losses. The decrease
    in yields resulted from the disruption and dislocation in the
    global financial markets experienced in 2008, which continued,
    but moderated, in 2009. The adverse yield impact was
    concentrated in the following four invested asset classes:

•

Fixed maturity securities — primarily due to lower
    yields on floating rate securities from declines in short-term
    interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding,
    higher quality, U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed securities, to increase liquidity in response to the
    extraordinary market conditions, as well as decreased income on
    our securities lending program, primarily due to the smaller
    size of the program in the current year. These adverse impacts
    were offset slightly as conditions improved late in 2009 and we
    began to reallocate our portfolio to higher-yielding assets;

•

Real estate joint ventures — primarily due to
    declining property valuations on certain investment funds that
    carry their real estate at estimated fair value and operating
    losses incurred on properties that were developed for sale by
    development joint ventures;

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments —
    primarily due to declines in short-term interest rates; and

•

Mortgage loans — primarily due to lower prepayments on
    commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on variable rate
    loans reflecting declines in short-term interest rates.



Equity markets experienced some recovery in 2009, which led to
    improved yields on other limited partnership interests. As many
    of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was significantly offset by lower interest
    credited expense on our investment and insurance products.

The financial market conditions also resulted in a
    $348 million increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit
    costs in our Retirement Products segment, as increased hedging
    losses were only partially offset by lower guaranteed benefit
    costs.

The key driver of the increase in other expenses stemmed from
    the impact of market conditions on certain expenses, primarily
    pension and postretirement benefit costs, reinsurance expenses
    and letter of credit fees. These increases coupled with higher
    variable costs, such as commissions and premium taxes, some of
    which have been capitalized, more than offset the favorable
    impact of lower information technology, travel, professional
    services and advertising expenses, which include the impact of
    our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative.

The market improvement which began in the second quarter of 2009
    was a key factor in the determination of our expected future
    gross profits, the increase of which triggered a decrease in DAC
    and DSI amortization, most significantly in the Retirement
    Products segment. The increase in our expected future gross
    profits stemmed primarily from an increase in the market value
    of our separate account balances, which is attributable, in
    part, to the improving financial markets. Our Insurance Products
    segment benefited, in the current year, from an increase in
    amortization of unearned revenue, primarily as a result of our
    annual review of assumptions that are used in the determination
    of the amount of amortization recognized. These collective
    changes in amortization resulted in a $720 million benefit,
    partially offsetting the declines in operating earnings
    available to common shareholders discussed above.

A portion of the decline in operating earnings available to
    common shareholders was caused by a $200 million reduction
    in the results of our closed block of business, a specific group
    of participating life policies that were segregated in
    connection with the demutualization of MLIC. Until early 2009,
    the operating earnings of the closed block did not have a full
    impact on operating earnings as the operating earnings or loss
    was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend
    obligation, a liability established at the time of
    demutualization. However, in early 2009 the policyholder
    dividend obligation was depleted and, as a result, the total
    operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 was, and in the future may be
    a component of operating earnings.

Business growth, from the majority of our businesses, along with
    net favorable mortality experience, had a positive impact on
    operating earnings available to common shareholders. These
    impacts were somewhat dampened by higher benefit utilization in
    our dental business and mixed claim activity in our
    Auto & Home segment. In addition, our forward and
    reverse residential mortgage platform acquisitions in late 2008
    benefited Banking, Corporate & Other’s 2009
    results.

Unfavorable market conditions, which continued through 2009,
    provided a challenging business environment for our Insurance
    Products segment. This resulted in lower net investment income
    and an increase in market sensitive expenses, primarily pension
    and postretirement benefit costs. We also experienced higher
    utilization of dental benefits along with a lower number of
    recoveries in our disability business. Higher levels of
    unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a
    decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth. However, revenue
    growth remained solid in all of our businesses. Revenue growth
    in our dental and individual life businesses reflected strong
    sales and renewals.

The significant components of the $168 million decline in
    operating earnings were the aforementioned decline in net
    investment income, especially in the closed block business,
    partially offset by an increase in the amortization of unearned
    revenue, the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain
    policyholders and favorable mortality in the individual life
    business.

Until early 2009, the earnings of the closed block did not have
    a full impact on operating earnings as the earnings or loss was
    partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend
    obligation. However, in early 2009 the policyholder dividend
    obligation was depleted and, as a result, the total operating
    earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was, and in the future may be, a
    component of operating earnings. This resulted in a
    $200 million decline in operating earnings in 2009.

The decrease in net investment income of $112 million was
    primarily due to a $317 million decrease from lower yields,
    partially offset by a $205 million increase from growth in
    average invested assets. Yields were adversely impacted by the
    severe downturn in the global financial markets, which primarily
    impacted other invested assets, real estate joint ventures and
    fixed maturity securities. In addition, income from our
    securities lending program decreased primarily due to the
    smaller size of the program in 2009. The growth in the average
    invested asset base was primarily from an increase in net flows
    from our individual life, non-medical health, and group life
    businesses. The moderate recovery in equity markets in 2009 led
    to improved yields on other limited partnership interests, which
    partially offset the overall reduction in yields. To manage the
    needs of our intermediate to longer-term liabilities, our
    portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed
    maturity securities, structured finance securities (comprised of
    mortgage and asset-backed securities), mortgage loans, and
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed fixed
    maturity securities and, to a lesser extent, certain other
    invested asset classes



including real estate joint ventures and other invested assets
    to provide additional diversification and opportunity for
    long-term yield enhancement.

Other expenses were essentially flat despite an increase of
    $137 million from the impact of market conditions on
    certain expenses, primarily pension and postretirement benefit
    costs. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of
    $85 million, predominantly from declines in information
    technology, travel, and professional services, including the
    positive impact of our enterprise-wide cost reduction and
    revenue enhancement initiative. A further reduction of expenses
    was achieved through a decrease in variable expenses, such as
    commissions and premium taxes of $46 million, a portion of
    which is offset by DAC capitalization.

The aforementioned declines in operating earnings were partially
    offset by the favorable impact of a $63 million decrease in
    policyholder dividends in the traditional life business, the
    result of a dividend scale reduction in the fourth quarter of
    2009. In addition, favorable mortality in the individual life
    business was partially offset by higher benefit utilization in
    the dental business during 2009, reflecting the negative
    employment trends in the marketplace. The net impact of these
    two items benefited operating earnings by $36 million. The
    2009 results were also favorably impacted by our review of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins, which in turn are factors in determining the
    amortization for DAC and unearned revenue. This review resulted
    in an unlocking event related to unearned revenue and, coupled
    with the impact from the prior year’s review, generated an
    increase in operating earnings of $82 million. This
    increase was recorded in universal life and investment-type
    product policy fees. Partially offsetting these increases was
    the impact of lower separate account balances, which resulted in
    lower fee income of $25 million.

DAC amortization reflects lower current year amortization of
    $108 million, stemming from the impact of the improvement
    in the financial markets in 2009, which increased our expected
    future gross profits, as well as lower current year gross
    margins in the closed block. This decrease was partially offset
    by the net impact of refinements in both the prior and current
    years of $98 million, the majority of which was recorded in
    the prior year as a result of the 2008 review of certain DAC
    related assumptions.

In 2009, Retirement Products benefited from a flight to quality,
    which contributed to a 10% improvement in combined sales of our
    fixed and variable products and a 28% reduction in surrenders
    and withdrawals. Our variable



annuity sales have outpaced the industry, increasing our market
    share. Fixed annuity sales benefited from enhanced marketing on
    our income annuity with life contingency products, which
    increased our premium revenues by $224 million, or 32%,
    before income taxes. In the annuity business, the movement in
    premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in
    policyholder benefits, as the insurance liability that we
    establish at the time we assume the risk under these contracts
    is typically equivalent to the premium earned less the amount of
    acquisition expenses. Our average PAB grew by $7.2 billion
    in 2009, primarily due to an increase in sales of fixed annuity
    products and more customers electing the fixed option on
    variable annuity sales. This has a favorable impact on earnings
    by increasing net investment income, which is somewhat offset by
    higher interest credited expense. Unfavorable market conditions
    resulted in poor investment performance, which outweighed the
    impact of higher variable annuity sales on our separate account
    balances causing the average separate account balance to remain
    lower than the previous year. This resulted in lower policy fees
    and other revenues which are based on daily asset balances in
    the policyholder separate accounts.

The improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver
    of the $128 million increase in operating earnings, with
    the largest impact resulting in a decrease in DAC, VOBA and DSI
    amortization of $655 million. The 2008 results reflected
    increased, or accelerated, amortization primarily stemming from
    a decline in the market value of our separate account balances.
    A factor that determines the amount of amortization is expected
    future earnings, which in the annuity business are derived, in
    part, from fees earned on separate account balances. The market
    value of our separate account balances declined significantly in
    2008, resulting in a decrease in the expected future gross
    profits, triggering an acceleration of amortization in 2008.
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the market conditions
    began to improve and the market value of our separate account
    balances began to increase, resulting in an increase in the
    expected future gross profits and a corresponding lower level of
    amortization in 2009.

Also contributing to the increase in operating earnings was an
    increase in net investment income of $308 million, which
    was primarily due to a $286 million increase from growth in
    average invested assets and a $22 million increase in
    yields. The increase in average invested assets was due to
    increased cash flows from the sales of fixed annuity products
    and more customers electing the fixed option on variable annuity
    sales, which were reinvested primarily in fixed maturity
    securities, other invested assets and mortgage loans. The
    increase in yields was due to moderate improvement in the equity
    markets in 2009 which led to an increase in yields principally
    for other limited partnership interests and certain other
    invested assets, which was partially offset by a decrease in
    yields on real estate joint ventures, reflecting the severe
    downturn in the global financial markets. To manage the needs of
    our intermediate to longer-term liabilities, our portfolio
    consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed maturity
    securities, structured finance securities, mortgage loans and
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed fixed
    maturity securities and, to a lesser extent, certain other
    invested asset classes, including real estate joint ventures in
    order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for
    long-term yield enhancement. As is typically the case with fixed
    annuity products, higher net investment income was somewhat
    offset by higher interest credited expense. Growth in our fixed
    annuity policyholder account balances increased interest
    credited expense by $186 million in 2009 and higher average
    crediting rates on fixed annuities increased interest credited
    expense by $27 million.

Operating earnings were negatively impacted by $348 million
    of operating losses related to the hedging programs for variable
    annuity minimum death and income benefit guarantees, which are
    not embedded derivatives, partially offset by a decrease in the
    liability established for these variable annuity guarantees. The
    various hedging strategies in place to offset the risk
    associated with these variable annuity guarantee benefits were
    more sensitive to market movements than the liability for the
    guaranteed benefit. Market volatility, improvements in the
    equity markets, and higher interest rates produced operating
    losses on these hedging strategies in the current year. Our
    hedging strategies, which are a key part of our risk management,
    performed as anticipated. The decrease in annuity guarantee
    benefit liabilities was due to the improvement in the equity
    markets, higher interest rates and the annual unlocking of
    future market expectations.

Other expenses increased by $216 million primarily due to
    an increase of $123 million from the impact of market
    conditions on certain expenses. These expenses are largely
    comprised of reinsurance costs, pension and postretirement
    benefit expenses, and letter of credit fees. In addition,
    variable expenses, such as commissions and premium taxes,
    increased $77 million, the majority of which have been
    offset by DAC capitalization. The positive impact of our
    enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative was reflected in lower travel,



professional services and advertising expenses, but was more
    than offset by increases largely due to business growth.

Finally, policy fees and other revenues decreased by
    $100 million, mainly due to lower average separate account
    balances in the current year versus prior year.

Corporate Benefit Funding benefited in certain markets in 2009
    as a flight to quality helped drive our increase in market
    share, especially in the structured settlement business, where
    we experienced a 53% increase in premiums. Our pension closeout
    business in the U.K .continues to expand and experienced premium
    growth during 2009 of almost $400 million, or 105% before
    income taxes. However, this growth was more than offset by a
    decline in our domestic pension closeout business driven by
    unfavorable market conditions and regulatory changes. A
    combination of poor equity returns and lower interest rates have
    contributed to pension plans being under funded, which reduces
    our customers’ flexibility to engage in transactions such
    as pension closeouts. Our customers’ plans funded status
    may be affected by a variety of factors, including the ongoing
    phased implementation of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, a
    comprehensive reform of defined benefit and defined contribution
    plan rules. For each of these businesses, the movement in
    premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in
    policyholder benefits. The insurance liability that is
    established at the time we assume the risk under these contracts
    is typically equivalent to the premium earned.

Market conditions also contributed to a lower demand for several
    of our investment-type products. The decrease in sales of these
    investment-type products is not necessarily evident in our
    results of operations as the transactions related to these
    products are recorded through the balance sheet. Our funding
    agreement products, primarily the LIBOR based contracts,
    experienced the most significant impact from the volatile market
    conditions. As companies seek greater liquidity, investment
    managers are refraining from repurchasing the contracts when
    they mature and are opting for more liquid investments. In
    addition, unfavorable market conditions continued to impact the
    demand for global guaranteed interest contracts, a type of
    funding agreement.

Policyholder account balances for our investment-type products
    were down by approximately $10 billion during 2009, as
    issuances were more than offset by scheduled maturities.
    However, due to the timing of issuances and maturities, the
    average policyholder account balances and liabilities increased
    from 2008 to 2009. The impact



of the decrease in policyholder account balances resulted in
    lower net investment income, which was somewhat offset by lower
    interest credited expense.

The primary driver of the $346 million decrease in
    operating earnings was lower net investment income of
    $707 million reflecting a $682 million decrease from
    lower yields and a $25 million increase due to growth in
    average invested assets. Yields were adversely impacted by the
    severe downturn in the global financial markets which impacted
    real estate joint ventures, fixed maturity securities, other
    invested assets and mortgage loans. In addition, income from our
    securities lending program decreased, primarily due to the
    smaller size of the program during the year. To manage the needs
    of our longer-term liabilities, our portfolio consists primarily
    of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities,
    mortgage loans, U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed securities and, to a lesser extent, certain other
    invested asset classes including real estate joint ventures in
    order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for
    long-term yield enhancement. For our shorter-term obligations,
    we invest primarily in structured finance securities, mortgage
    loans and investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities.
    The yields on these investments have moved consistent with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR and Treasury, on
    which they are based. The growth in the average invested asset
    base is consistent with the increase in the average policyholder
    account balances and liabilities.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was somewhat offset by lower net interest
    credited expense of $380 million. The decrease in interest
    credited expense is attributed to $431 million from lower
    crediting rates. Crediting rates have moved consistent with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR, on which they are
    based. The increase in the average policyholder account balances
    resulted in a $51 million increase in interest credited
    expense.

The year over year decline in operating earnings was also due in
    part to lower other revenues as the prior year benefited by
    $44 million in fees for the cancellation of a bank owned
    life insurance stable value wrap policy combined with the
    surrender of a global guaranteed interest contract. In addition,
    a refinement to a reinsurance recoverable in the small business
    record keeping line of business in the latter part of 2009 also
    contributed $20 million to the decrease in operating
    earnings.

Current year results benefited from favorable liability
    refinements as compared to unfavorable liability refinements in
    2008, as well as improved mortality experience in the current
    year, all in the pension closeouts business. These items
    improved 2009 operating earnings by approximately
    $90 million. Other products generated mortality gains or
    losses; however, the net change did not have a material impact
    on our year over year results.

Although our other expenses only increased marginally and are
    not a significant driver of the decrease in operating earnings,
    the general themes associated with the increase are consistent
    with those factors discussed above in the discussion of our
    consolidated results of operations. Market conditions triggered
    an increase in our pension and postretirement benefit expenses
    of $26 million. In addition, variable expenses, such as
    commissions and premium taxes, have increased $20 million.
    These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
    $36 million, primarily in information technology, travel
    and professional services expenses, all of which were largely
    due to our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue
    enhancement initiative.

Auto & Home was negatively impacted in 2009 by a
    declining housing market, the deterioration of the new auto
    sales market and the continuation of credit availability issues,
    all of which contributed to a decrease in insured exposures in
    2009. Average premiums per policy increased slightly for our
    homeowners’ policies but decreased for auto policies,
    primarily as a result of a business shift in insured exposures
    by state. In particular, we experienced a large decrease in
    earned exposures in Massachusetts, whose market was impacted by
    a regulatory change, which resulted in a marked increase in
    competition.

A return to more normal weather conditions in 2009 resulted in
    fewer, and less severe, catastrophe events than in 2008. This
    was more than offset by an increase in both non-catastrophe
    claim frequencies and non-catastrophe claim severities in 2009.

Mixed claim experience and the impact of lower exposures were
    the primary drivers of the $41 million decrease in
    operating earnings. While we had a $90 million decrease in
    catastrophe-related losses compared to the prior year, we also
    recorded $68 million less of a benefit in 2009 from
    favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses.
    Current year claim costs rose primarily as a result of a
    $29 million increase in claim frequency from both our auto
    and homeowners products. In addition, we had a $15 million
    net increase in claim severity, stemming from higher severity in
    our auto line of business that was partially offset by lower
    severity in our homeowners line of business. In 2009, we
    experienced a decline in insured exposures, which contributed
    approximately $16 million to the decrease in operating
    earnings. While this decrease in exposures had a positive impact
    on the amount of claims, it was more than offset by the negative
    impact on premiums. The decrease in exposures is largely
    attributable to slightly higher non-renewal rates, partially
    offset by greater sales of new policies. Also contributing to
    the decline in earnings was a decrease of $9 million in the
    average premium per policy, which is primarily due to a shift in
    earned exposures to lower average premium states and an increase
    of $10 million in loss adjustment expenses, primarily
    related to a decrease in unallocated loss adjusting expense
    liabilities at the end of 2008.

The impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the
    unfavorable change in the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, to 88.9% in 2009 from 83.1% in 2008 and the
    unfavorable change in the combined ratio, including
    catastrophes, to 92.3% in 2009 from 91.2% in 2008.

A $25 million decrease in other expenses, including the net
    change in DAC, partially offset the declines in operating
    earnings discussed above. This improvement resulted from
    decreases in sales-related expenses and from minor fluctuations
    in a number of expense categories, a portion of which is due to
    our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative.



Also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was a
    decline in net investment income of $4 million which was
    primarily due to a $9 million decrease from a decline in
    average invested assets, partially offset by an increase of
    $5 million due to improved yields.

An improvement in the global financial markets contributed to a
    recovery of sales in the majority of our International regions
    and resulted in improved investment performance in some regions
    during the second half of 2009. Sales in Asia Pacific were down
    primarily from a decrease in variable annuity sales in Japan,
    primarily as a result of pricing actions we took during the
    latter half of 2009. This decline was somewhat offset by growth
    in South Korea’s fixed annuities product and an increase of
    variable universal life sales, which are indications that
    markets are beginning to recover. We experienced growth in the
    pension, group life, and medical businesses of our Latin America
    region, specifically in Mexico. Our operations in Europe and the
    Middle East continue to have strong growth in the European
    variable annuity business.

The reduction in operating earnings includes the adverse impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2009 as the
    U.S. dollar strengthened against the various foreign
    currencies. This decreased operating earnings by
    $99 million in 2009 relative to 2008. Excluding the impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, operating
    earnings increased $83 million, or 22%, from the prior
    year. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating
    earnings of $184 million in our Asia Pacific region, while
    operating earnings from our Latin America and Europe and Middle
    East decreased by $83 million and $18 million,
    respectively.

Asia Pacific.

Improving financial market
    conditions was the primary driver of the increase in operating
    earnings. net investment income in the region increased by
    $422 million due to an increase of $278 million from
    improved yields on our investment portfolio, $111 million
    from the change in results of operating joint ventures, and
    $33 million from an increase in average invested assets.
    The increase in yields was primarily due to higher income of
    $277 million on the trading and other securities portfolio,
    stemming from equity markets experiencing some recovery in 2009.
    As our trading and other securities portfolio backs unit-linked
    policyholder liabilities, this increase in income was entirely
    offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense.
    The income of the Japan joint venture improved by
    $103 million due to favorable investment results and lower
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. The decrease in DAC and VOBA
    amortization was primarily due to an increase in the market
    value of



the joint venture’s separate account balances, which is
    directly tied to the improving financial markets. A factor that
    determines the amount of DAC and VOBA amortization is expected
    future fees earned on separate account balances. Since the
    market value of separate account balances have increased, it is
    expected that future earnings on this block of business will be
    higher than previously anticipated. As a result, the
    amortization of DAC and VOBA was less in the current year.

Operating earnings in this region also benefited from higher
    surrender charges of $16 million. Difficult economic
    conditions in South Korea during the first half of the year
    resulted in a higher level of surrenders. Growth in our Japan
    reinsurance business and an increase in reinsurance rates
    contributed $21 million to the increase in operating
    earnings. In addition, the favorable impact of a reduction in
    the liability for our variable annuity guarantees contributed
    $22 million to operating earnings. The change in the
    liability was primarily due to an increase in separate account
    balances in the Japan joint venture. These liabilities are
    accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual
    and future expected policy assessments based on the level of
    guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios
    of separate account returns. The scenarios use best estimate
    assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. Because
    separate account balances have had positive returns relative to
    the prior year, current estimates of future benefits are lower
    than that previously projected which resulted in a decrease in
    this liability in the current period. Partially offsetting these
    increases, higher DAC amortization of $49 million resulted
    from business growth and favorable investment results.

Latin America.

The decrease in operating
    earnings was primarily driven by lower net investment income.
    Net investment income decreased by $297 million due to a
    decrease of $383 million from lower yields, partially
    offset by an increase of $86 million due to an increase in
    average invested assets. The decrease in yields was due, in
    part, to the impact of changes in assumptions for measuring the
    effects of inflation on certain inflation-indexed fixed maturity
    securities. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction of
    $221 million in the related insurance liability primarily
    due to lower inflation. The increase in net investment income
    attributable to an increase in average invested assets was
    primarily due to business growth and, as such, was largely
    offset by increases in policyholder benefits and interest
    credited expense.

Higher claims experience in Mexico resulted in a
    $45 million decline in operating earnings. The
    nationalization and reform of the pension business in Argentina
    impacted both years earnings, resulting in a net
    $36 million decline in operating earnings. In addition,
    operating earnings decreased due to a net income tax increase of
    $8 million in Mexico, resulting from a change in assumption
    regarding the repatriation of earnings, partially offset by the
    favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2009.

Partially offsetting these decreases in operating earnings was
    the combination of growth in Mexico’s individual and
    institutional businesses and higher premium rates in its
    institutional business, which increased operating earnings by
    $51 million. Pesification in Argentina impacted both the
    current year and prior year earnings, resulting in a net
    $73 million increase in operating earnings. This benefit
    was largely due to a reassessment of our approach in managing
    existing and potential future claims related to certain social
    security pension annuity contract holders in Argentina resulting
    in a liability release. Lower expenses of $8 million
    resulted primarily from the impact of operational efficiencies
    achieved through our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue
    enhancement initiative.

Europe and Middle East.

The impact of foreign
    currency transaction gains and a tax benefit, both of which
    occurred in the prior year, contributed $12 million to the
    decline in operating earnings. Our investment of $9 million
    in our distribution capability and growth initiatives in 2009
    also reduced operating earnings. There was an increase in net
    investment income of $76 million, which was due to an
    increase of $65 million from an improvement in yields and
    $11 million from an increase in average invested assets.
    The increase in yields was primarily due to favorable results on
    the trading and other securities portfolio, stemming from the
    equity markets experiencing some recovery in 2009. As our
    trading and other securities portfolio backs unit-linked
    policyholder liabilities, the trading and other securities
    portfolio results were entirely offset by a corresponding
    increase in interest credited expense. The increase in net
    investment income attributable to an increase in average
    invested assets was primarily due to business growth and was
    largely offset by increases in policyholder benefits and
    interest credited expense, also due to business growth.

Banking, Corporate & Other recognized the full year
    impact of our forward and reverse residential mortgage platform
    acquisitions, a strong residential mortgage refinance market,
    healthy growth in the reverse mortgage arena, and a favorable
    interest spread environment. Our forward and reverse residential
    mortgage production of $37.4 billion in 2009 was up 484%
    compared to 2008 production. The increase in mortgage production
    drove higher investments in residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

and MSRs. At December 31, 2009, our residential mortgage
    loans servicing portfolio was $64.1 billion comprised of
    agency (FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA) portfolios. Transaction and time
    deposits, which provide a relatively stable source of funding
    and liquidity and are used to fund loans and fixed income
    securities purchases, grew 48% in 2009 to $10.2 billion.
    Borrowings decreased 10% in 2009 to $2.4 billion. During
    2009, we participated in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    Term Auction Facility, which provided short term liquidity with
    low funding costs.

In response to the economic crisis and unusual financial market
    events that occurred in 2008 and continued into 2009, we decided
    to utilize excess debt capacity. The Holding Company completed
    three debt issuances in 2009. The Holding Company issued
    $397 million of floating rate senior notes in March 2009,
    $1.3 billion of senior notes in May 2009, and
    $500 million of junior subordinated debt securities in July
    2009. In February 2009, in connection with the initial
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts issued as part of the
    common equity units sold in June 2005, the Holding Company
    issued common stock for $1.0 billion. The proceeds from
    these equity and debt issuances were used for general corporate
    purposes and have resulted in increased investments and cash and
    cash equivalents held within Banking, Corporate &
    Other.

Operating earnings available to common shareholders improved by
    $114 million, of which $254 million was due to MetLife
    Bank and its acquisitions of a residential mortgage origination
    and servicing business and a reverse mortgage business, both
    during 2008. Excluding the impact of MetLife Bank, our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders decreased
    $140 million, primarily due to lower net investment income,
    partially offset by the impact of a lower effective tax rate.
    The lower effective tax rate provided an increased benefit of
    $139 million from the prior year. This benefit was the
    result of a partial settlement of certain prior year tax audit
    issues and increased utilization of tax preferenced investments,
    which provide tax credits and deductions.



Excluding a $68 million increase from MetLife Bank, net
    investment income decreased $283 million, which was
    primarily due a decrease of $287 million due to lower
    yields, partially offset by an increase of $4 million due
    to an increase in average invested assets. Consistent with the
    consolidated results of operations discussion above, yields were
    adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global
    financial markets, which primarily impacted fixed maturity
    securities and real estate joint ventures. The increased average
    invested asset base was due to cash flows from debt issuances
    during 2009. Our investments primarily include structured
    finance securities, investment grade corporate fixed maturity
    securities, U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed
    fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. In addition, our
    investment portfolio includes the excess capital not allocated
    to the segments. Accordingly, it includes a higher allocation of
    certain other invested asset classes to provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement
    including leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests,
    real estate, real estate joint ventures and equity securities.

After excluding the impact of a $394 million increase from
    MetLife Bank, other expenses increased by $20 million.
    Deferred compensation costs, which are tied to equity market
    performance, were higher due to a significant market rebound. We
    also had an increase in costs associated with the implementation
    of our enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative. These increases were partially offset by lower
    postemployment related costs and corporate-related expenses,
    specifically legal costs. Legal costs were lower largely due to
    the prior year commutation of asbestos policies. In addition,
    interest expense declined slightly as a result of rate
    reductions on variable rate collateral financing arrangements
    offset by debt issuances in 2009 and 2008.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material
    effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar
    as inflation may affect interest rates.

Inflation in the U.S. has remained contained and been in a
    general downward trend for an extended period. However, in light
    of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus
    measures by the U.S. federal government and foreign
    governments, it is possible that inflation could increase in the
    future. Globally, inflation trends can vary by region and
    between developed and emerging markets. The Japanese economy, to
    which we face increased exposure as a result of the Acquisition,
    continues to experience low nominal growth and a deflationary
    environment. As the global economy improves, inflation trends
    are increasing in other regions, particularly in emerging
    markets like China and India. In the more developed Eurozone
    countries, inflation rates, while not as high, have trended
    upward at a greater pace than in the U.S.

An increase in inflation could affect our business in several
    ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed income
    investments falls which could increase realized and unrealized
    losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor and other
    materials, potentially putting pressure on profitability if such
    costs can not be passed through in our product prices. Inflation
    could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss
    adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses, which could
    require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for
    future inflation. Prolonged and elevated inflation could
    adversely affect the financial markets and the economy
    generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a
    restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain
    overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the
    number of attractive investment opportunities.

Investments

Investment Risks.

The Company’s primary
    investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax,
    risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return
    while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The Company is exposed to four primary
    sources of investment risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the
    continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of
    principal and interest;

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow
    variability associated with changes in market interest rates;



•

liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell
    certain investments in times of strained market
    conditions; and

•

market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the
    estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in
    market factors such as credit spreads.

The Company manages risk through in-house fundamental analysis
    of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and
    real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk,
    market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and
    issuer diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and
    agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and market
    valuation risk through geographic, property type and product
    type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages
    interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management
    strategies; product design, such as the use of market value
    adjustment features and surrender charges; and proactive
    monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of
    its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and
    dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The
    Company also uses certain derivative instruments in the
    management of credit, interest rate, currency and equity market
    risks.

Current Environment.

The global economy and
    markets are now recovering from a period of significant stress
    that began in the second half of 2007 and substantially
    increased through the first quarter of 2009. This disruption
    adversely affected the financial services industry, in
    particular. The U.S. economy entered a recession in late
    2007. This recession ended in mid-2009, but the recovery from
    the recession has been below historic averages and the
    unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time. In
    addition, inflation has fallen over the last several years and
    is expected to remain at low levels for some time. Some
    economists believe that some level of disinflation and deflation
    risk remains in the U.S. economy.

Although the disruption in the global financial markets has
    moderated, not all such markets are functioning normally, and
    some remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity.
    The global recession and disruption of the financial markets has
    also led to concerns over capital markets access and the
    solvency of certain European Union member states, including
    Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. The Japanese
    economy, to which we face increased exposure to as a result of
    the Acquisition, continues to experience low nominal growth, a
    deflationary environment, and weak consumer spending. See
    “— Industry Trends.” See also
    “Investments — Fixed Maturity and Equity
    Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — Summary” in Note 3 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about
    exposure to sovereign fixed maturity securities of Portugal,
    Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the net unrealized
    loss position on fixed maturity and equity securities improved
    from a net unrealized loss of $2.2 billion at
    December 31, 2009 to a net unrealized gain of
    $7.3 billion at December 31, 2010, as a result of a
    decrease in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, a decrease
    in credit spreads.

Investment Outlook.

Recovering private equity
    markets and stabilizing credit and real estate markets during
    2010 had a positive impact on returns and net investment income
    on private equity funds, hedge funds and real estate funds,
    which are included within other limited partnership interests
    and real estate and real estate joint venture portfolios.
    Although the disruption in the global financial markets has
    moderated, if there is a resumption of significant disruption,
    it could adversely impact returns and net investment income on
    these alternative investment classes. Net cash flows arising
    from our business and our investment portfolio will be
    reinvested in a prudent manner and according to our ALM
    discipline in appropriate assets over time. We will maintain a
    sufficient level of liquidity to meet business needs. Net
    investment income may be adversely affected if excess liquidity
    is required over an extended period of time to meet changing
    business needs.

As described in the footnotes below, the yield table reflects
    certain differences from the presentation of invested assets,
    net investment income, net investment gains (losses) and net
    derivative gains (losses) as presented in the consolidated
    balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations,
    including the exclusion of contractholder-directed unit-linked
    investments classified within trading and other securities, as
    the contractholder, not the Company, directs the investment of
    the funds; and the exclusion of the effects of consolidating
    under GAAP certain VIEs that are consolidated securitization
    entities (“CSEs”). We believe this yield table
    presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment
    performance for management purposes enhances understanding.

(1)

Yields are based on average of quarterly average asset carrying
    values, excluding recognized and unrealized investment gains
    (losses), collateral received from counterparties associated
    with our securities lending program, the effects of
    consolidating under GAAP certain VIEs that are treated as CSEs
    and, effective October 1, 2010, contractholder-directed
    unit-linked investments. Yields also exclude investment income
    recognized on mortgage loans and securities held by CSEs and,
    effective October 1, 2010, contractholder-directed
    unit-linked investments.

(2)

Fixed maturity securities include $594 million,
    $2,384 million and $946 million at estimated fair
    value of trading and other securities at December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Fixed maturity securities include
    $234 million, $400 million and ($193) million of
    investment income related to trading and other securities for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

(3)

(a) Fixed maturity securities ending carrying values as
    presented herein, exclude (i) contractholder-directed
    unit-linked investments — reported within trading and
    other securities of $17,794 million, and
    (ii) securities held by CSEs that are consolidated under
    GAAP — reported within trading and other securities of
    $201 million at December 31, 2010. Net investment
    income as presented herein, excludes investment income on
    contractholder-directed unit-linked investments —
    reported within trading and other securities effective
    October 1, 2010 as shown in footnote (6) to this yield
    table.

(b) Ending carrying values, investment income and
    investment gains (losses) as presented herein, exclude the
    effects of consolidating under GAAP certain VIEs that are
    treated as CSEs. The adjustment to investment income and
    investment gains (losses) in the aggregate are as shown in
    footnote (6) to this yield table. The adjustments to ending
    carrying value, investment income and investment gains (losses)
    by invested asset class are presented below. Both the invested
    assets and long-term debt of the CSEs are accounted for under
    the FVO. The adjustment to investment gains (losses) presented
    below and in footnote (6) to this yield table includes the
    effects of remeasuring both the invested assets and long-term
    debt in accordance with the FVO.

Other invested assets are principally comprised of freestanding
    derivatives with positive estimated fair values and leveraged
    leases. Freestanding derivatives with negative estimated fair
    values are included within other liabilities. However, the
    accruals of settlement payments in other liabilities are
    included in net investment income as shown in Note 4 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As yield is not
    considered a meaningful measure of performance for other
    invested assets, it has been excluded from the yield table.

(6)

Investment income, investment portfolio gains (losses) and
    derivative gains (losses) presented in this yield table vary
    from the most directly comparable measures presented in the GAAP
    consolidated statements of operations due to certain
    reclassifications affecting net investment income, net
    investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), and
    interest credited to PABs and to exclude the effects of
    consolidating under GAAP certain VIEs that are treated as CSEs.
    Such reclassifications are presented in the tables below.

Fixed
    Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale

Fixed maturity securities, which consisted principally of
    publicly-traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities,
    were $327.3 billion and $227.6 billion, or 69% and 67%
    of total cash and invested assets at estimated fair value, at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Publicly-traded
    fixed maturity securities represented $286.5 billion and
    $191.4 billion, or 88% and 84% of total fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Privately placed fixed maturity
    securities represented $40.8 billion and
    $36.2 billion, or 12% and 16% of total fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

Equity securities, which consisted principally of
    publicly-traded and privately-held common and preferred stocks,
    including certain perpetual hybrid securities and mutual fund
    interests, were $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion, or 0.8%
    and 0.9% of total cash and invested assets at estimated fair
    value, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Publicly-traded equity securities represented $2.3 billion
    and $2.1 billion, or 64% and 68% of total equity securities
    at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Privately-held equity securities represented
    $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, or 36% and 32% of total
    equity securities at estimated fair value, at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Valuation of Securities.

We are responsible
    for the determination of estimated fair value. The estimated
    fair value of publicly-traded fixed maturity, equity and trading
    and other securities, as well as short-term securities is
    determined by management after considering one of three primary
    sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets,
    independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations.
    The number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends
    on the liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we
    obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset
    classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but
    ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the
    fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value
    these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies
    based on inputs that are market observable or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Such
    observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets
    in active, liquid markets, quoted prices in markets that are not
    active and observable yields and spreads in the market. The
    market standard valuation methodologies utilized include:
    discounted cash flow methodologies, matrix pricing or similar
    techniques. The assumptions and inputs in applying these market
    standard valuation methodologies include, but are not limited
    to, interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or
    counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated
    duration, and management’s assumptions regarding liquidity
    and estimated future cash flows. When a price is not available
    in the active market or through an independent pricing service,
    management will value the security primarily using independent
    non-binding broker quotations. Independent non-binding broker
    quotations utilize inputs that are not market observable or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data.

Senior management, independent of the trading and investing
    functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems
    and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new
    transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable
    market prices and market-based parameters are used for
    valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that
    judgmental valuation adjustments, if any, are based upon
    established policies and are applied consistently over time. We
    review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and
    ensure that any changes to valuation methodologies are
    justified. We gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and
    consistent application of input assumptions, valuation
    methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair
    value determination through various controls designed to ensure
    that the financial assets and financial liabilities are
    appropriately valued and represent an exit price. The control
    systems and procedures include, but are not limited to, analysis
    of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns,
    comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the
    fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to
    management’s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the
    bid/ask spreads to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that
    independent pricing services use, wherever possible,
    market-based parameters for valuation. We determine the
    observability of inputs used in



estimated fair values received from independent pricing services
    or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated
    by observable market data. The Company also follows a formal
    process to challenge any prices received from independent
    pricing services that are not considered representative of
    estimated fair value. If we conclude that prices received from
    independent pricing services are not reflective of market
    activity or representative of estimated fair value, we will seek
    independent non-binding broker quotes or use an internally
    developed valuation to override these prices. Such overrides are
    classified as Level 3. Despite the credit events prevalent
    since the second half of 2007 described above, including market
    dislocation, volatility in valuation of certain investments, and
    reduced levels of liquidity, which has since moderated but is
    still present in certain portions of the global financial
    markets and in certain asset sectors, our internally developed
    valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect our
    estimates of liquidity and non-performance risks, compared with
    pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not
    produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed
    maturity securities portfolio. Our estimates of liquidity and
    non-performance risks are generally based on available market
    evidence and on what other market participants would use. In the
    absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is
    used. As a result, we generally continued to use the price
    provided by the independent pricing service under our normal
    pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material. The
    Company uses the results of this analysis for classifying the
    estimated fair value of these instruments in Level 1, 2 or
    3. For example, we will review the estimated fair values
    received to determine whether corroborating evidence (i.e.,
    similar observable positions and actual trades) will support a
    Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy.
    Security prices which cannot be corroborated due to relatively
    less pricing transparency and diminished liquidity will be
    classified as Level 3. Even some of our very high quality
    invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a
    result of the market conditions described above.

For privately placed fixed maturity securities, the Company
    determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix
    pricing, discounted cash flow techniques or from independent
    pricing services after assessing that the observability of
    inputs used can be corroborated with observable market data. The
    discounted cash flow valuations rely upon the estimated future
    cash flows of the security, credit spreads of comparable public
    securities and secondary transactions, as well as taking into
    account, among other factors, the credit quality of the issuer
    and the reduced liquidity associated with privately placed debt
    securities.

The Company has reviewed the significance and observability of
    inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the
    appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its
    securities. Based on the results of this review and investment
    class analyses, each instrument is categorized as Level 1,
    2 or 3 based on the priority of the inputs to the respective
    valuation methodologies. Certain U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities, certain foreign
    government fixed maturity securities, residential
    mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), principally
    to-be-announced securities, exchange-traded common stock and
    mutual fund interests, registered mutual fund interests priced
    using daily net asset value provided by fund managers included
    within trading and other securities, certain other securities
    classified as trading and other securities which are similar to
    the above described fixed maturity and equity securities and
    certain short-term money market securities, including
    U.S. Treasury bills, have been classified into Level 1
    because of high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid/ask
    spreads. Most securities valued by independent pricing services
    have been classified into Level 2 because the significant
    inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or
    can be corroborated using market observable information. Most
    investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities and
    certain below investment grade privately placed fixed maturity
    securities priced by independent pricing services that use
    observable inputs have been classified within Level 2.
    Distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been
    classified within Level 3. Below investment grade privately
    placed fixed maturity securities and less liquid securities with
    very limited trading activity where estimated fair values are
    determined by independent pricing services or by independent
    non-binding broker quotations that use unobservable inputs or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data, are classified as Level 3. Use of independent
    non-binding broker quotations generally indicates there is a
    lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the
    process to develop these price estimates causing them to be
    considered Level 3.

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted accounting
    guidance that clarified existing guidance regarding
    (1) estimating the estimated fair value of an asset or
    liability if there was a significant decrease in the volume and
    level of trading activity for these assets or liabilities and
    (2) identifying transactions that are not orderly. The



Company’s valuation policies as described above and in
    “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Estimated Fair Values of Investments”
    already incorporated the key concepts from this additional
    guidance, accordingly, this guidance results in no material
    changes in our valuation policies. At April 1, 2009 and at
    each subsequent quarterly period in 2009 and 2010, we evaluated
    the markets that our fixed maturity and equity securities trade
    in and in our judgment, despite the increased illiquidity
    discussed above, believe none of these fixed maturity and equity
    securities trading markets should be characterized as distressed
    and disorderly. We will continue to re-evaluate and monitor such
    fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets on an
    ongoing basis.

The composition of fair value pricing sources for and
    significant changes in Level 3 securities at
    December 31, 2010 are as follows:

•

The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity
    securities (84%, as presented above) were concentrated in four
    sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities, ABS and
    foreign government securities.

•

Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally
    through market standard valuation methodologies, independent
    pricing services and independent non-binding broker quotations
    using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
    Level 3 fixed maturity securities consists of less liquid
    fixed maturity securities with very limited trading activity or
    where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation methodologies including alternative residential
    mortgage loan RMBS and less liquid prime RMBS, certain below
    investment grade private placements and less liquid investment
    grade corporate securities (included in U.S. and foreign
    corporate securities) and less liquid ABS including securities
    supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans (included in ABS).

•

During the year ended December 31, 2010, Level 3 fixed
    maturity securities increased by $371 million, or 2%,
    excluding the impact of the Acquisition, and
    $5,605 million, or 33%, including the impact of the
    Acquisition. The Level 3 fixed maturity securities acquired
    from ALICO of $5,435 million have been included in
    purchases, sales, issuances and settlements in the table below.
    The increase was driven by net purchases in excess of sales and
    increases in estimated fair value recognized in other
    comprehensive income (loss). Net purchases in excess of sales of
    fixed maturity securities were concentrated in foreign
    government and ABS. The increase in estimated fair value in
    fixed maturity securities was concentrated in U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities and ABS (including RMBS backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans) due to improving or stabilizing market
    conditions including an improvement in liquidity coupled with
    the effect of decreased interest rates on such securities.



A rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities

    follows:

•

Total gains and losses in earnings and other comprehensive

    Level 3 occurred at the beginning of the period. Items
    transferred in and out for the same period are excluded from the
    rollforward.

•

Total gains and losses for fixed maturity securities included in
    earnings of ($2) million and other comprehensive income
    (loss) of $19 million respectively, were incurred for
    transfers subsequent to their transfer to Level 3, for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

•

Net transfers into

and/or

    of Level 3 for fixed maturity securities were
    $53 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and
    were comprised of transfers in of $1,736 million and
    transfers out of ($1,683) million, respectively.

Overall, transfers into

and/or

out
    of Level 3 are attributable to a change in the
    observability of inputs. Assets and liabilities are transferred
    into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be
    corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when
    market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs
    cannot be observed, current prices are not available, and when
    there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby
    affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred
    out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a
    significant input can be corroborated with market observable
    data. This may be due to a significant increase in market
    activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s)
    becoming observable. Transfers into

and/or

out
    of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the
    period. Significant transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 assets and liabilities for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 are summarized below.

•

During the year ended December 31, 2010, fixed maturity
    securities transfers into Level 3 of $1,736 million
    resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized
    by a lack of trading activity, decreased liquidity and credit
    ratings downgrades (e.g., from investment grade to below
    investment grade). These current market conditions have resulted
    in decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of
    broker quotations and unobservable inputs to determine estimated
    fair value principally for certain private placements included
    in U.S. and foreign corporate securities and certain CMBS.

•

During the year ended December 31, 2010, fixed maturity
    securities transfers out of Level 3 of ($1,683) million
    resulted primarily from increased transparency of both new
    issuances that subsequent to issuance and establishment of
    trading activity, became priced by independent pricing services
    and existing issuances that, over time, the Company was able to
    corroborate pricing received from independent pricing services
    with observable inputs, or there were increases in market
    activity and upgraded credit ratings primarily for certain
    U.S. and foreign corporate securities, RMBS and ABS.

    Estimates — Estimated Fair Value of Investments”

Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality —
    Ratings.

The Securities Valuation Office of the
    National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) evaluates the fixed maturity security
    investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital
    assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit
    quality categories called “NAIC designations.” If no
    rating is available from the NAIC, then as permitted by the
    NAIC, an internally developed rating is used. The NAIC ratings
    are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the
    Nationally Recognized Statistical Ratings Organizations
    (“NRSROs”) for marketable fixed maturity securities,
    called “rating agency designations,” except for
    certain structured securities as described below. NAIC ratings 1
    and 2 include fixed maturity securities generally considered
    investment grade (i.e., rated “Baa3” or better by
    Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) or
    rated “BBB” or better by S&P and Fitch Ratings
    (“Fitch”)) by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings
    3 through 6 include fixed maturity securities generally
    considered below investment grade (i.e., rated “Ba1”
    or lower by Moody’s or rated “BB+” or lower by
    S&P and Fitch) by such rating organizations.

The NAIC adopted revised rating methodologies for non-agency
    RMBS, including RMBS backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans reported within ABS, that became effective
    December 31, 2009 and for CMBS and all other ABS that
    became effective December 31, 2010. The NAIC’s
    objective with the revised rating methodologies for these
    structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing
    expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine
    a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured
    securities. The revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance
    on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into
    the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from such
    structured securities.

The three tables below present fixed maturity securities based
    on rating agency designations and equivalent designations of the
    NAIC, with the exception of certain structured securities held
    by the Company’s insurance subsidiaries that file NAIC
    statutory financial statements. Non-agency RMBS, including RMBS
    backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans reported within ABS, CMBS and all other ABS held
    by the Company’s insurance subsidiaries that file NAIC
    statutory financial statements are presented based on final
    ratings from the revised NAIC rating methodologies described
    above (which may not correspond to rating agency designations).
    All NAIC designation (e.g., NAIC 1) amounts and percentages
    presented herein are based on the revised NAIC methodologies
    described above. All rating agency designation (e.g., Aaa/AAA)
    amounts and percentages presented herein are based on rating
    agency designations without adjustment for the revised NAIC
    methodologies described above.

The following three tables present information about the
    Company’s fixed maturity securities holdings by NAIC credit
    quality ratings. Comparisons between NAIC ratings and rating
    agency designations are published by the NAIC. Rating agency
    designations are based on availability of applicable ratings
    from rating agencies on the NAIC acceptable rating organizations
    list, including Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and Realpoint,
    LLC. If no rating is available from a rating agency, then an
    internally developed rating is used.



The following table presents the Company’s total fixed
    maturity securities by NRSRO designation and the equivalent
    designations of the NAIC, except for certain structured
    securities, which are presented using final ratings from the
    revised NAIC rating methodologies as described above, as well as
    the percentage, based on estimated fair value, that each
    designation is comprised of at:

See “Investments — Fixed

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — RMBS” in Note 3 of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the tables that
    present the Company’s RMBS holdings by security type and
    risk profile at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The majority of RMBS held by the Company was rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch; and the majority was rated NAIC
    1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2010 and 2009, as presented
    above. The majority of the agency RMBS held by the Company was
    guaranteed or otherwise supported by FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA.
    Non-agency RMBS includes prime and alternative residential
    mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) RMBS. Prime residential
    mortgage lending includes the origination of residential
    mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers with high
    quality credit profiles. Alt-A is a classification of mortgage
    loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls between prime
    and

sub-prime.

Sub-prime

mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage
    loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. Included within
    Alt-A RMBS are resecuritization of real estate mortgage
    investment conduit (“Re-REMIC”) securities. Re-REMIC
    Alt-A RMBS involve the pooling of previous issues of Alt-A RMBS
    and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and
    subordinated securities. The credit enhancement on the senior
    tranches is improved through the resecuritization. The
    Company’s holdings are in senior tranches with significant
    credit enhancement.

The Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has superior
    structure to the overall Alt-A market. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has no
    exposure to option adjustable rate mortgages (“ARMs”)
    and a minimal exposure to hybrid ARMs. The Company’s Alt-A
    securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate
    mortgages which have performed better than both option ARMs and
    hybrid ARMs in the overall Alt-A market. Additionally, 85% and
    90% at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, of the
    Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has super senior
    credit enhancement, which typically provides double the credit
    enhancement of a standard Aaa/AAA rated fixed maturity security.
    See “Investments — Fixed Maturity and Equity
    Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — RMBS” in Note 3 of the Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements for a table that presents
    the estimated fair value of Alt-A securities held by the Company
    by vintage year, net unrealized loss, portion of holdings rated
    Aa/AA or better by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, portion
    rated NAIC 1 by the NAIC, and portion of holdings that are
    backed by fixed rate collateral or hybrid ARM collateral at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company’s holdings of
    Re-REMIC Alt-A RMBS reported within Alt-A RMBS were all rated
    NAIC 1 and were $703 million and $782 million at
    estimated fair value at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.



RMBS in which the present value of projected future cash flows
    expected to be collected is less than amortized cost are
    reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment
    policy. Based upon the analysis of the Company’s exposure
    to RMBS, including Alt-A RMBS, the Company expects to receive
    payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the
    securities that are considered temporarily impaired.

CMBS.

There have been disruptions in the CMBS
    market due to market perceptions that default rates will
    increase in part as a result of weakness in commercial real
    estate market fundamentals and in part to relaxed underwriting
    standards by some originators of commercial mortgage loans
    within the more recent vintage years (i.e., 2006 and later).
    These factors caused a pull-back in market liquidity, increased
    credit spreads and repricing of risk, which has led to higher
    levels of unrealized losses as compared to historical levels
    through the first quarter of 2010. However, in the second
    quarter of 2010, market conditions continued to improve and
    interest rates continue to decrease, causing our portfolio to be
    in a net unrealized gain position of 2% of amortized cost at
    December 31, 2010.

CMBS in which the present value of projected future cash flows
    expected to be collected is less than amortized cost are
    reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment
    policy. Based upon the analysis of the Company’s exposure
    to CMBS, the Company expects to receive payments in accordance
    with the contractual terms of the securities that are considered
    temporarily impaired.

The Company’s holdings in CMBS were $20.7 billion and
    $15.6 billion, at estimated fair value at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. See “Investments —
    Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — CMBS” in Note 3 of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present
    the amortized cost and estimated fair value, rating agency
    designation by Moody’s, S&P, Fitch or Realpoint, LLC
    and holdings by vintage year of such securities held by the
    Company at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company had no
    exposure to CMBS index securities at December 31, 2010 or
    2009. The Company’s holdings of commercial real estate
    collateralized debt obligations securities were
    $138 million and $111 million at estimated fair value
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The weighted
    average credit enhancement of the Company’s CMBS holdings
    was 26% and 28% at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. This credit enhancement percentage represents the
    current weighted average estimated percentage of outstanding
    capital structure subordinated to the Company’s investment
    holding that is available to absorb losses before the security
    incurs the first dollar of loss of principal. The credit
    protection does not include any equity interest or property
    value in excess of outstanding debt.

ABS.

The Company’s ABS are diversified
    both by collateral type and by issuer. See
    “Investments — Fixed Maturity and Equity
    Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — ABS” in Note 3 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table that presents
    the Company’s ABS by collateral type, portion rated
    Aaa/AAA, portion rated NAIC 1, and portion credit enhanced held
    by the Company at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

The slowing U.S. housing market, greater use of affordable
    mortgage products and relaxed underwriting standards for some
    originators of

sub-prime

mortgage loans have recently led to higher delinquency and loss
    rates, especially within the 2006 and 2007 vintage years. These
    factors have caused a pull-back in market liquidity and
    repricing of risk, which has led to higher levels of unrealized
    losses on securities backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans as compared to historical levels. However, in
    2010, market conditions improved, credit spreads narrowed on
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and net unrealized
    losses on ABS backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans decreased from 36% to 22% of amortized cost from
    December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010.

ABS in which the present value of projected future cash flows
    expected to be collected is less than amortized cost are
    reviewed for impairment in accordance with our impairment
    policy. Based upon the analysis of the Company’s ABS,
    including

sub-prime

mortgage loans through its exposure to ABS, the Company expects
    to receive payments in accordance with the contractual terms of
    the securities that are considered temporarily impaired.

See “Investments— Fixed Maturity and Equity
    Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — ABS” in Note 3 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present
    the Company’s holdings of ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans by rating agency designation and by vintage year
    and by NAIC rating at December 31, 2010 and 2009.



The Company had ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans with estimated fair values of $1,119 million
    and $1,044 million and unrealized losses of
    $317 million and $593 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 54% of this portfolio
    was rated Aa or better, of which 88% was in vintage year 2005
    and prior at December 31, 2010. Approximately 61% of this
    portfolio was rated Aa or better, of which 91% was in vintage
    year 2005 and prior at December 31, 2009. These older
    vintages from 2005 and prior benefit from better underwriting,
    improved enhancement levels and higher residential property
    price appreciation. All of the $1,119 million and
    $1,044 million of ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans were classified as Level 3 fixed maturity
    securities in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

ABS also include collateralized debt obligations backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans at an aggregate cost of $18 million with an
    estimated fair value of $17 million at December 31,
    2010 and an aggregate cost of $22 million with an estimated
    fair value of $8 million at December 31, 2009.

    number of securities, total gross unrealized loss and percentage
    of total gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2010 and
    2009.

Fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss greater than $10 million, decreased
    $2.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010.
    The cause of the decline in, or improvement in, gross unrealized
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily
    attributable to a decrease in interest rates and narrowing of
    credit spreads. These securities were included in the
    Company’s OTTI review process. Based upon the
    Company’s current evaluation of these securities in
    accordance with its impairment policy and the Company’s
    current intentions and assessments (as applicable to the type of
    security) about holding, selling, and any requirements to sell
    these securities, the Company has concluded that these
    securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    and severity of an unrealized loss position for equity
    securities is given greater weight and consideration than for
    fixed maturity securities. An extended and severe unrealized
    loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any
    impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled
    interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for an equity security,
    greater weight and consideration is given by the Company to a
    decline in market value and the likelihood such market value
    decline will recover.

    information about the Company’s equity securities

with a gross unrealized loss of 20% or more at December 31,
    2010.

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process at December 31, 2010, the Company evaluated its
    holdings in non-redeemable preferred stock, particularly those
    of financial services companies. The Company considered several
    factors including whether there has been any deterioration in
    credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of
    non-redeemable preferred stock with a severe or an extended
    unrealized loss. The Company also considered whether any
    non-redeemable preferred stock with an unrealized loss held by
    the Company, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any
    dividend payments. No such dividend payments had been deferred.



With respect to common stock holdings, the Company considered
    the duration and severity of the unrealized losses for
    securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more and the
    duration of unrealized losses for securities in an unrealized
    loss position of less than 20% in an extended unrealized loss
    position (i.e., for 12 months or greater).

Future OTTI will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
    issuer performance (including changes in the present value of
    future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit
    rating, changes in collateral valuation, changes in interest
    rates and changes in credit spreads. If economic fundamentals
    and any of the above factors deteriorate, additional OTTI may be
    incurred in upcoming quarters.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses) Including OTTI Losses Recognized in
    Earnings

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on
    the recognition and presentation of OTTI that amends the
    methodology to determine for fixed maturity securities whether
    an OTTI exists, and for certain fixed maturity securities,
    changes how OTTI losses that are charged to earnings are
    measured. There was no change in the methodology for
    identification and measurement of OTTI losses charged to
    earnings for impaired equity securities.

Overview of Fixed Maturity and Equity Security OTTI Losses
    Recognized in Earnings.

Impairments of fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $484 million,
    $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairments
    of fixed maturity securities were $470 million,
    $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Impairments
    of equity securities were $14 million, $400 million
    and $430 million for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company’s credit-related impairments of fixed maturity
    securities were $423 million, $1.1 billion and
    $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company’s three largest impairments totaled
    $105 million, $508 million and $528 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

The Company records OTTI losses charged to earnings within net
    investment gains (losses) and adjusts the cost basis of the
    fixed maturity and equity securities accordingly. The Company
    does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries
    in value.

The Company sold or disposed of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss that had an estimated fair value of
    $18.2 billion, $10.2 billion and $29.9 billion
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Gross losses excluding impairments for fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $628 million,
    $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities
    impairments are as follows:

•

Year Ended December 31, 2010 compared to the Year Ended
    December 31, 2009 —

Overall OTTI losses
    recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities
    were $484 million for the current year as compared to
    $1.9 billion in the prior year. Improving or stabilizing
    market conditions across all sectors and industries,
    particularly the financial services industry, as compared to the
    prior year when there was significant stress in the global
    financial markets, resulted in a higher level of impairments in
    fixed maturity and equity securities in the prior year. The most
    significant decrease in the current year, as compared to the
    prior year, was in the Company’s financial services
    industry holdings which comprised $799 million in fixed
    maturity and equity security impairments in the prior year, as
    compared to $129 million in impairments in the current
    year. Of the $799 million in financial services industry
    impairments in the year, $340 million were in equity
    securities, of which $310 million were in financial
    services industry perpetual hybrid securities which were
    impaired as a result of deterioration in the credit rating of
    the issuer to below investment grade and due to a severe and
    extended unrealized loss position on these securities.
    Impairments



in the current year were concentrated in the RMBS, ABS and CMBS
    sectors reflecting current economic conditions including higher
    unemployment levels and continued weakness within the real
    estate markets. Of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    impairments of $484 million and $1,900 million in the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    $287 million and $449 million, or 59% and 24%
    respectively, were in the Company’s RMBS, ABS and CMBS
    holdings.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to the Year Ended
    December 31, 2008 —

Overall OTTI losses
    recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities
    were $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. The stress
    in the global financial markets that caused a significant
    increase in impairments in 2008 as compared to 2007, continued
    into 2009. Significant impairments were incurred in several
    industry sectors in 2009, including the financial services
    industry, but to a lesser degree in the financial services
    industry sector than in 2008. In 2008 certain financial
    institutions entered bankruptcy, entered FDIC receivership or
    received significant government capital infusions causing 2008
    financial services industry impairments to be higher than in
    2009. Of the fixed maturity and equity securities impairments of
    $1,900 million in 2009, $799 million were concentrated
    in the Company’s financial services industry holdings and
    were comprised of $459 million in impairments on fixed
    maturity securities and $340 million in impairments on
    equity securities, and the $799 million included
    $623 million of perpetual hybrid securities, which were
    comprised of $313 million on securities classified as fixed
    maturity securities and $310 million on securities
    classified as non-redeemable preferred stock. Overall
    impairments in 2009 were higher due to increased fixed maturity
    security impairments across several industry sectors, which more
    than offset a reduction in impairments in the financial services
    industry sector. Impairments across these several industry
    sectors increased in 2009 due to increased financial
    restructurings, bankruptcy filings, ratings downgrades,
    collateral deterioration or difficult operating environments of
    the issuers as a result of the challenging economic environment.
    Impairments on perpetual hybrid securities in 2009 were a result
    of deterioration in the credit rating of the issuer to below
    investment grade and due to a severe and extended unrealized
    loss position.

    industry for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and

Future Impairments.

Future OTTI will depend
    primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance, changes
    in credit ratings, changes in collateral valuation, changes in
    interest rates and changes in credit spreads. If economic
    fundamentals and other of the above factors deteriorate,
    additional OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods. See also

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities and short-term investments, are loaned to third
    parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. The
    Company generally obtains collateral, generally cash, in an
    amount equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the loaned
    securities, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and
    maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the
    duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions
    may be sold or repledged by the transferee. The Company is
    liable to return to its counterparties the cash collateral under
    its control. These transactions are treated as financing
    arrangements and the associated liability recorded at the amount
    of the cash received.

See “Investments — Securities Lending” in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information regarding the Company’s
    securities lending program.

The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to
    the cash collateral on open at December 31, 2010 was
    $2,699 million, of which $2,317 million were
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities
    which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy
    the cash requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan
    were primarily U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed securities, and very liquid RMBS. The
    U.S. Treasury securities on loan are primarily holdings of

on-the-run

U.S. Treasury securities, the most liquid
    U.S. Treasury securities available. If these high quality
    securities that are on loan are put back to the Company, the
    proceeds from immediately selling these securities can be used
    to satisfy the related cash requirements. The reinvestment
    portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted
    principally of fixed maturity securities (including RMBS,
    U.S. corporate, U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed, and ABS). If the on loan securities or the
    reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has the
    liquidity resources of most of its general account available to
    meet any potential cash demands when securities are put back to
    the Company.

Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection
    with the securities lending transactions may not be sold or
    repledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Separately,
    the Company had $49 million and $46 million, at
    estimated fair value, of cash and security collateral on deposit
    from a counterparty to secure its interest in a pooled
    investment that is held by a third-party trustee, as custodian,
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This pooled
    investment is included within fixed maturity securities and had
    an estimated fair value of $49 million and $51 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

See also “ — Investments — Securities
    Lending” for the amount of the Company’s cash and
    invested assets received from and due back to counterparties

Trading
    and Other Securities

The Company has a trading securities portfolio, principally
    invested in fixed maturity securities, to support investment
    strategies that involve the active and frequent purchase and
    sale of securities (“Actively Traded Securities”) and
    the execution of short sale agreements. Trading and other
    securities also include securities for which the FVO has been
    elected (“FVO Securities”). FVO Securities include
    certain fixed maturity and equity securities held for investment
    by the general account to support asset and liability matching
    strategies for certain insurance products. FVO Securities also
    include contractholder-directed investments supporting
    unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not
    qualify for presentation as separate account summary total
    assets and liabilities. These investments are primarily mutual
    funds, and to a lesser extent, fixed maturity and equity
    securities, short-term investments and cash and cash
    equivalents. The investment returns on these investments inure
    to contractholders and are offset by a corresponding change in
    PABs through interest credited to PABs. Changes in



estimated fair value of such trading and other securities
    subsequent to purchase are included in net investment income.
    FVO Securities also include securities held by CSEs (former
    qualifying special purpose entities) with changes in estimated
    fair value subsequent to consolidation included in net
    investment gains (losses). Trading and other securities were
    $18.6 billion and $2.4 billion, or 3.9% and 0.7% of
    total cash and invested assets at estimated fair value, at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The significant
    increase in trading and other securities in 2010 was driven
    primarily by inclusion of ALICO’s contractholder-directed
    unit-linked investments, and to a lesser extent, growth in this
    book of business that occurred during the ten month period ended
    October 31, 2010 prior to the Acquisition. See
    “Investments — Trading and Other Securities”
    in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for tables which present information about the
    Actively Traded Securities and FVO Securities, related short
    sale agreement liabilities, investments pledged to secure short
    sale agreement liabilities, net investment income, changes in
    estimated fair value included in net investment income for
    trading and other securities and changes in estimated fair value
    included in net investment gains (losses) for FVO Securities
    held by CSEs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Mortgage
    Loans

The Company’s mortgage loans are principally collateralized
    by commercial real estate, agricultural real estate and
    residential properties. The carrying value of mortgage loans was
    $62.4 billion and $50.9 billion, or 13.1% and 15.1% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. See “Investments — Mortgage
    Loans” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a table that presents the
    Company’s mortgage loans

of $59.1 billion and $48.2 billion by portfolio
    segment at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, as
    well as the components of the mortgage loans

held-for-sale

of $3.3 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The information presented on
    Mortgage



Loans herein excludes the effects of consolidating under GAAP
    certain VIEs that are treated as CSEs. Such amounts are
    presented in the aforementioned table. See
    “Investments — Mortgage Loans” in

    Statements.

Commercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property
    Type.

Commercial mortgage loans are the most
    significant component of the mortgage loan invested asset class
    as it represents 72% of total mortgage loans

held-for-investment

(excluding the effects of consolidating under GAAP certain VIEs
    that are treated as CSEs) at both December 31, 2010 and
    2009. The Company diversifies its commercial mortgage loan
    portfolio by both geographic region and property type to reduce
    the risk of concentration. Additionally, the Company manages
    risk, when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage
    loans, by generally lending only up to 75% of the estimated fair
    value of the underlying real estate. The tables below present

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Restructured,
    Potentially Delinquent, Delinquent or Under
    Foreclosure.

The Company monitors its mortgage
    loan investments on an ongoing basis, including reviewing loans
    that are restructured, potentially delinquent, and delinquent or
    under foreclosure. These loan classifications are consistent
    with those used in industry practice.



The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in
    which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the
    debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
    debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company defines
    potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in management’s
    opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent in the
    near term. The Company defines delinquent mortgage loans
    consistent with industry practice, when interest and principal
    payments are past due as follows: commercial mortgage
    loans — 60 days past due; agricultural mortgage
    loans — 90 days past due; and residential
    mortgage loans — 60 days past due. The Company
    defines mortgage loans under foreclosure as loans in which
    foreclosure proceedings have formally commenced.

The following table presents the recorded investment and
    valuation allowance for all mortgage loans

held-for-investment

distributed by the above stated loan classifications at:

(1)

Of the $12.8 billion of agricultural mortgage loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2010, 53% were subject to rate
    resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion of these
    mortgage loans have been successfully renegotiated and remain
    outstanding to maturity.

Residential mortgage loans

held-for-investment

consist primarily of first lien residential mortgage loans, and
    to a much lesser extent, second lien residential mortgage loans
    and home equity lines of credit.

See “Investments — Mortgage Loans” in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for tables that present, by portfolio segment,
    mortgage loans by credit quality indicator and impaired loans,
    as well as information on past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Monitoring
    Process — Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage
    Loans.

The Company reviews all commercial
    mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an
    analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll,
    lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis,
    estimated valuations of the underlying collateral,

loan-to-value

ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant



creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk
    loans, which include those that are classified as restructured,
    potentially delinquent, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as
    loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring
    process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar,
    with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios, including reviews on a geographic and property type
    basis.

Loan-to-value

ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in
    the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans.

Loan-to-value

ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of
    agricultural mortgage loans.

Loan-to-value

ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair
    value of the underlying collateral. A

loan-to-value

ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is
    greater than the collateral value. A

loan-to-value

ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value
    over the loan amount. The debt service coverage ratio compares a
    property’s net operating income to amounts needed to
    service the principal and interest due under the loan. For
    commercial mortgage loans, the average

loan-to-value

ratio was 66% and 68% at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, and the average debt service coverage ratio was
    2.4x, as compared to 2.2x at December 31, 2009. For
    agricultural mortgage loans, the average

loan-to-value

ratio was 49% at both December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The values utilized in calculating these ratios
    are developed in connection with our review of the commercial
    and agricultural mortgage loans, and are updated routinely,
    including a periodic quality rating process and an evaluation of
    the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral.

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Monitoring
    Process — Residential Mortgage
    Loans.

The Company has a conservative residential
    mortgage loan portfolio and does not hold any option ARMs,

sub-prime

or
    low teaser rate. Higher risk loans include those that are
    classified as restructured, potentially delinquent, delinquent
    or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios and interest-only loans. The Company’s investment in
    residential junior lien loans and residential mortgage loans
    with a

loan-to-value

ratio of 80% or more was $95 million and $76 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and the
    majority of the higher

loan-to-value

residential mortgage loans have mortgage insurance coverage
    which reduces the

loan-to-value

ratio to less than 80%. Additionally, the Company’s
    investment in traditional residential interest-only mortgage
    loans was $389 million and $323 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances.

The
    Company’s valuation allowances are established both on a
    loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a
    property specific or market specific risk has been identified
    that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools
    of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property
    specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but
    for which the Company expects to incur a loss. Accordingly, a
    valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated
    probable credit losses. The Company records additions to and
    decreases in its valuation allowances and gains and losses from
    the sale of loans in net investment gains (losses).

The Company records valuation allowances for loans considered to
    be impaired when it is probable that, based upon current
    information and events, the Company will be unable to collect
    all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
    agreement. Based on the facts and circumstances of the
    individual loans being impaired, loan specific valuation
    allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the
    loan over either: (i) the present value of expected future
    cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective
    interest rate; (ii) the estimated fair value of the
    loan’s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process
    of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent; or
    (iii) the loan’s observable market price.

The Company also establishes valuation allowances for loan
    losses for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics,
    such as property types,

loan-to-value

ratios and debt service coverage ratios when, based on past
    experience, it is probable that a credit event has occurred and
    the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. These valuation
    allowances are based on loan risk characteristics, historical
    default rates and loss severities, real estate market
    fundamentals and outlook, as well as, other relevant factors.

The determination of the amount of, and additions or decreases
    to, valuation allowances is based upon the Company’s
    periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks
    associated with its loan portfolios. Such evaluations and
    assessments are based upon several factors, including the
    Company’s experience for loan losses, defaults and loss
    severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk
    characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised
    as conditions change and new information becomes available. We
    update our evaluations



regularly, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase
    or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative
    credit migration including an actual or expected increase in the
    level of problem loans will result in an increase in the
    valuation allowance. Positive credit migration including an
    actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans will
    result in a decrease in the valuation allowance. Such changes in
    the valuation allowance are recorded in net investment gains
    (losses).

See “Investments — Mortgage Loans” in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a table that presents the activity in the
    Company’s valuation allowances, by portfolio segment, for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively; and for tables that present the Company’s
    valuation allowances, by type of credit loss, by portfolio
    segment, at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company held $197 million and $210 million in
    mortgage loans which are carried at estimated fair value based
    on the value of the underlying collateral or independent broker
    quotations, if lower, of which $164 million and
    $202 million relate to impaired mortgage loans

held-for-investment

and $33 million and $8 million to certain mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale,

at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These impaired
    mortgage loans were recorded at estimated fair value and
    represent a nonrecurring fair value measurement. The estimated
    fair value is categorized as Level 3. Included within net
    investment gains (losses) for such impaired mortgage loans were
    net impairments of $17 million and $93 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
    Subsequent improvements in estimated fair value on previously
    impaired loans recorded through a reduction in the previously
    established provision to the valuation allowance are reported as
    a (release) above.

Real
    Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures

The Company diversifies its real estate investments by both
    geographic region and property type to reduce risk of
    concentration. Of the Company’s real estate investments,
    88% are located in the U.S. with the remaining 12% located
    outside the U.S., at December 31, 2010. The carrying value
    of the Company’s real estate investments was
    $8.0 billion, or 1.7%, and $6.9 billion, or 2.0%, of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. See “Investments — Real
    Estate” in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for tables that present the Company’s
    real estate investments by investment strategy and by property
    type at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Properties acquired through foreclosure were $165 million,
    $127 million and less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
    includes commercial, agricultural and residential properties.
    After the Company acquires properties through foreclosure, it
    evaluates whether the property is appropriate for retention in
    its traditional real estate portfolio. Foreclosed real estate
    held at December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes those
    properties the Company has not selected for retention in its
    traditional real estate portfolio and which do not meet the
    criteria to be classified as

held-for-sale.

Impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-investment

were $48 million, $160 million and $20 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-sale

were $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    There were no impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-sale

for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
    Company’s carrying value of real estate

held-for-sale

has been reduced by impairments recorded prior to 2009 of
    $1 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    carrying value of non-income producing real estate was
    $137 million, $76 million and $28 million at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The impaired cost method basis real estate joint ventures were
    recorded at estimated fair value and represent a non-recurring
    fair value measurement. The estimated fair value was categorized
    as Level 3. Impairments to estimated fair value for such
    cost method basis real estate joint ventures of
    $25 million, $82 million, and $0 for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were
    recognized within net investment gains (losses) and are included
    in the $48 million, $160 million and $20 million
    of impairments on real estate investments

held-for-investment

for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The estimated fair value of the impaired cost
    method real estate joint ventures after these impairments was
    $8 million and $93 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.



Other
    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that principally make private equity investments in
    companies in the U.S. and overseas) was $6.4 billion
    and $5.5 billion, or 1.3% and 1.6% of total cash and
    invested assets at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Included within other limited partnership
    interests were $1.0 billion, at both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, of investments in hedge funds.

Impairments on cost basis limited partnership interests are
    recognized at estimated fair value determined from information
    provided in the financial statements of the underlying other
    limited partnership interests in the period in which the
    impairment is recognized. Consistent with equity securities,
    greater weight and consideration is given in the other limited
    partnership interests impairment review process to the severity
    and duration of unrealized losses on such other limited
    partnership interests holdings. Impairments to estimated fair
    value for such other limited partnership interests of
    $12 million, $354 million and $105 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, were recognized within net investment gains
    (losses). The estimated fair value of the impaired other limited
    partnership interests after these impairments was
    $23 million, $561 million and $137 million at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    impairments to estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair
    value measurements that have been classified as Level 3 due
    to the limited activity and price transparency inherent in the
    market for such investments.

Other
    Invested Assets

See “Investments — Other Invested Assets” in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a table that presents the Company’s other
    invested assets by type at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and
    related information.

Short-term
    Investments

The carrying value of short-term investments, which include
    investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but
    greater than three months, at the time of purchase was
    $9.4 billion and $8.4 billion, or 2.0% and 2.5% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively. The Company is exposed to concentrations of
    credit risk related to securities of the U.S. government
    and certain U.S. government agencies included within
    short-term investments, which were $4.0 billion and
    $7.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Cash
    Equivalents

The carrying value of cash equivalents, which includes
    investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
    months or less, at the time of purchase was $9.6 billion
    and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit
    risk related to securities of the U.S. government and
    certain U.S. government agencies included within cash
    equivalents, which were $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives.

The Company is exposed to various
    risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including
    interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, and
    equity market risk. The Company uses a variety of strategies to
    manage these risks, including the use of derivative instruments.
    See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for:

The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of
    significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher
    degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations
    of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although
    Level 3 inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate
    given the circumstances and are assumed to be consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments, the use of different inputs or methodologies could
    have a material effect on the estimated fair value of
    Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.

Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31,
    2010 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which
    extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve;
    interest rate lock commitments with certain unobservable inputs,
    including pull-through rates; equity variance swaps with
    unobservable volatility inputs or that are priced via
    independent broker quotations; foreign currency swaps which are
    cancelable and priced through independent broker quotations;
    interest rate swaps with maturities which extend beyond the
    observable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps
    based upon baskets of credits having unobservable credit
    correlations, as well as credit default swaps with maturities
    which extend beyond the observable portion of the credit curves
    and credit default swaps priced through independent broker
    quotes; foreign currency forwards priced via independent broker
    quotations or with liquidity adjustments; implied volatility
    swaps with unobservable volatility inputs or that are priced via
    independent broker quotations; equity options with unobservable
    volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker
    quotations; currency options based upon baskets of currencies
    having unobservable currency correlations; and credit forwards
    having unobservable repurchase rates.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, 2.0% and 5.5%, respectively,
    of the net derivative estimated fair value was priced via
    independent broker quotations.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $3.8 billion and
    $4.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts will be
    invested in partnerships over the next five years.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company intends to sell the
    majority of these originated residential mortgage loans.

held-for-sale

are considered derivatives pursuant to the guidance on
    derivatives and hedging, and their estimated fair value and
    notional amounts are included within interest rate forwards.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be

held-for-investment

in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing
    the Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments in the
    normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $2.4 billion and
    $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

There are no other material obligations or liabilities arising
    from the commitments to fund partnership investments, mortgage
    loans, bank credit facilities, and bridge loans and private
    corporate bond investment arrangements.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and
    sublease agreements for office space, information technology and
    other equipment. The Company’s commitments under such lease
    agreements are included within the contractual obligations
    table. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Contractual Obligations.”

Credit
    Facilities, Committed Facilities and Letters of
    Credit

The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities
    and letters of credit with various financial institutions. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Credit and Committed Facilities,” for further descriptions
    of such arrangements.

Guarantees

See “Guarantees” in Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Collateral
    for Securities Lending

The Company has no non-cash collateral for securities lending on
    deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or repledged, and
    which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets.



Insolvency
    Assessments

See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

The Company establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially
    determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy
    obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured
    dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered
    events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for
    actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For
    more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see “—
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates.” Also see
    Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for an analysis of certain policyholder liabilities
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial
    liabilities, the Company cannot precisely determine the amounts
    that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial
    liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the
    estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur
    until well into the future.

However, we believe our actuarial liabilities for future
    benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to
    be paid to policyholders. We periodically review our estimates
    of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
    with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
    permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
    expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
    development of actuarial liabilities.

The Company has experienced, and will likely in the future
    experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism,
    and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact
    on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
    Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
    pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes,
    explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing
    water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such
    as terrorist attacks. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the
    incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from
    catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of
    catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk
    from these perils.

Future
    Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an
    extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated
    as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid,
    reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying
    assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial
    standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of
    liabilities for future policy benefits include mortality,
    morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, investment
    returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as
    appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions
    are established at the time the policy is issued and are
    intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy
    benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities
    are established on a block of business basis. If experience is
    less favorable than assumed and future losses are projected
    under loss recognition testing, then additional liabilities may
    be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and
    claims.

Insurance Products.

Future policy benefits are
    comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under
    disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for
    survivor income benefit insurance, long-term care
    (“LTC”) policies, active life policies and premium
    stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under
    participating life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk,
    the Company has often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk
    on new individual life insurance policies. The reinsurance
    programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in
    increases or decreases to existing coverage. The Company entered
    into various derivative positions, primarily interest rate swaps
    and swaptions, to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums
    received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of
    the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original
    pricing of these contracts.



Retirement Products.

Future policy benefits
    are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income
    annuities, supplemental contracts with and without life
    contingencies, liabilities for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits
    (“GMDBs”) included in certain annuity contracts, and a
    certain portion of guaranteed living benefits. See “—
    Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Corporate Benefit Funding.

Liabilities are
    primarily related to structured settlement annuities. There is
    no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. A
    sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact
    earnings as a result. The Company has various derivative
    positions, primarily interest rate floors and interest rate
    swaps, to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.

Auto & Home.

Future policy benefits
    include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for
    property and casualty insurance and represent the amount
    estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and
    claims incurred but not reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims
    are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim
    frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends,
    legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are
    based upon the Company’s historical experience and analyses
    of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss
    adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and
    consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends
    and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage
    and subrogation.

International.

Future policy benefits are held
    primarily for traditional life and accident and health contracts
    in Japan, Asia Pacific and immediate annuities in Latin America.
    They are also held for total return pass-thru provisions
    included in certain universal life and savings products mainly
    in Japan and Latin America, and traditional life, endowment and
    annuity contracts sold in various countries in Asia Pacific.
    They also include certain liabilities for variable annuity
    guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees
    sold in Japan and Asia Pacific. Finally, in Europe and the
    Middle East, they also include unearned premium liabilities
    established for credit insurance contracts covering death,
    disability and involuntary loss of employment, as well as
    traditional life, accident and health and endowment contracts.
    Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of
    lower yields than rates established at issue, lower than
    expected asset reinvestment rates, higher than expected lapse
    rates, asset default and more rapid improvement of mortality
    levels than anticipated for life contingent immediate annuities.
    The Company mitigates its risks by implementing an
    asset/liability matching policy and through the development of
    periodic experience studies. See “— Variable Annuity
    Guarantees.”

Estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim
    expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these
    changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of
    operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of
    prior year losses.

Banking, Corporate & Other.

Future
    policy benefits primarily include liabilities for quota-share
    reinsurance agreements for certain LTC and workers’
    compensation business written by MetLife Insurance Company of
    Connecticut (“MICC”), prior to its acquisition by
    MetLife, Inc. These are run-off businesses that have been
    included within Banking, Corporate & Other since the
    acquisition of MICC.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

Policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account
    value, which includes accrued interest credited, but exclude the
    impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred
    upon surrender.

Insurance Products.

Policyholder account
    balances are held for death benefit disbursement retained asset
    accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable
    life insurance policies, specialized life insurance products for
    benefit programs and general account universal life policies.
    Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate
    set by the Company, which are influenced by current market
    rates. The majority of the policyholder account balances have a
    guaranteed minimum credited rate between 0.5% and 6.0%. A
    sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact
    earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees.
    The Company has various derivative positions, primarily interest
    rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with
    such a scenario.

Retirement Products.

Policyholder account
    balances are held for fixed deferred annuities and the fixed
    account portion of variable annuities, for certain income
    annuities, and for certain portions of guaranteed benefits.



Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate
    set by the Company. Credited rates for deferred annuities are
    influenced by current market rates, and most of these contracts
    have a minimum guaranteed rate between 1.0% and 4.0%. See
    “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Corporate Benefit Funding.

Policyholder
    account balances are comprised of funding agreements. Interest
    crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or
    variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied
    to an external index, most commonly

1-month

or

3-month

LIBOR. MetLife is exposed to interest rate risks, and foreign
    exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return
    of principal at the contractual maturity date. The Company may
    invest in floating rate assets, or enter into floating rate
    swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps to
    mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. The
    Company also mitigates its risks by implementing an
    asset/liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign
    currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges,
    including cross currency swaps.

International.

Policyholder account balances
    are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans
    in Japan and Latin America and to a lesser degree, amounts for
    unit-linked-type funds in certain countries across all regions
    that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also
    included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings
    products sold in certain countries in Japan and Asia Pacific
    that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees.
    Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in
    Japan and Asia Pacific are established in accordance with
    derivatives and hedging guidance and are also included within
    policyholder account balances. These liabilities are generally
    impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates, where there
    are interest rate guarantees. The Company mitigates its risks by
    implementing an asset/liability matching policy and by hedging
    its variable annuity guarantees. Liabilities for
    unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value
    of the associated underlying investments, as the return on
    assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder. See
    “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Variable
    Annuity Guarantees

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a
    minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit
    base) less withdrawals. In some cases the benefit base may be
    increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or
    market value resets. These guarantees are accounted for as
    insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on
    how and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is
    accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid
    without requiring (i) the occurrence of specific insurable
    event, or (ii) the policyholder to annuitize.
    Alternatively, a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance
    liability if the guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the
    occurrence of a specific insurable event, or (ii) upon
    annuitization. In certain cases, a guarantee may have elements
    of both an insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in
    such cases the guarantee is accounted for under a split of the
    two models.

The net amount at risk (“NAR”) for guarantees can
    change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained
    shifts in equity market performance, increased equity
    volatility, or changes in interest rates. The NAR disclosed in
    Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements represents management’s estimate of the current
    value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all
    exercised simultaneously at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. However, there are features, such as deferral
    periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death, that
    limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near
    future.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as
    embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and
    included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted
    for as embedded derivatives include GMAB, the non
    life-contingent portion of GMWB and the portion of certain GMIB
    that do not require annuitization. For more detail on the
    determination of estimated fair value, see Note 5 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Included in net derivative gains (losses) for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were gains (losses) of
    ($269) million and $1,806 million, respectively, in
    embedded derivatives related to the change in estimated fair
    value of the guarantees. The carrying amount of guarantees
    accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for
    nonperformance risk. In connection with this adjustment, gains
    (losses) of ($96) million and ($1,932) million are
    included in the gains (losses) of ($269) million and
    $1,806 million in net derivative gains (losses) for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded
    derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity
    volatility, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
    Additionally, because the estimated fair value for guarantees
    accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for
    nonperformance risk, a decrease in the Company’s credit
    spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to increase.
    Conversely, a widening of the Company’s credit spreads
    could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease. The
    Company uses derivative instruments and reinsurance to mitigate
    the liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility of net
    income associated with these liabilities. The derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures,
    equity options and variance swaps, and interest rate swaps. The
    change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk is not
    hedged.

Included in net derivative gains (losses) for the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 were gains (losses) of
    $113 million and ($3,654) million related to the
    change in estimated fair value of the above derivatives.



Additionally, included in net derivative gains (losses) for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were gains (losses)
    of ($35) million and $0, respectively, related to ceded
    reinsurance.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, have liabilities
    established that are included in future policy benefits.
    Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the
    life-contingent portion of certain GMWB, and the portion of GMIB
    that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued over
    the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future
    expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed
    minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate
    account returns. The scenarios use best estimate assumptions
    consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition
    costs. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those
    previously projected or when current estimates of future
    assessments are lower than those previously projected,
    liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge
    to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current
    estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously
    projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed
    those previously projected. At each reporting period, the
    Company updates the actual amount of business remaining
    in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the
    projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current
    period charge or increase to earnings.

Included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 is a charge of $302 million and for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 is a credit of
    $92 million, related to the respective change in
    liabilities for the above guarantees.

The carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as insurance
    liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, increased
    equity volatility, or changes in interest rates. The Company
    uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to
    mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility
    of net income associated with these liabilities. Derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity futures, treasury futures
    and interest rate swaps.

Included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the
    hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were gains (losses) of
    $8 million and ($114) million, respectively, related
    to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives carried
    at estimated fair value and gains (losses) of
    ($275) million and ($376) million, respectively,
    related to freestanding derivatives.

While the Company believes that the hedging strategies employed
    for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances
    and in future policy benefits, as well as other management
    actions, have mitigated the risks related to these benefits, the
    Company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event
    that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or
    unwilling to pay. Certain of the Company’s reinsurance
    agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and
    derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements,
    both of which, significantly reduces the exposure to
    counterparty risk. In addition, the Company is subject to the
    risk that hedging and other management procedures prove
    ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or
    mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces
    economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management
    techniques employed. Lastly, because the valuation of the
    guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an
    adjustment for nonperformance risk that is not hedged, changes
    in the nonperformance risk may result in significant volatility
    in net income.



Other
    Policy-related Balances

Other policy-related balances include policy and contract
    claims, unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in
    advance, policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, LTC and dental
    claims, as well as claims that have been reported but not yet
    settled. The liability for these claims is based on the
    Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims.
    The Company derives estimates for the development of incurred
    but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of
    historical patterns of claims and claims development for each
    line of business. The methods used to determine these estimates
    are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this
    continuous review process and differences between estimates and
    payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and
    claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed
    or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    deferred acquisition costs. Such amortization is recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees.

Also included in other policy-related balances are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Policyholder
    Dividends Payable

Policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related
    to dividends payable in the following calendar year on
    participating policies.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Overview

Our business and results of operations are materially affected
    by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy,
    generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.
    The global economy and markets are now recovering from a period
    of significant stress that began in the second half of 2007 and
    substantially increased through the first quarter of 2009. This
    disruption adversely affected the financial services industry,
    in particular. Consequently, financial institutions paid higher
    spreads over benchmark U.S. Treasury securities than before
    the market disruption began. The U.S. economy entered a
    recession in late 2007. This recession ended in mid-2009, but
    the recovery from the recession has been below historic averages
    and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some
    time. Although conditions in the financial markets continued to
    materially improve in 2010, there is still some uncertainty as
    to whether the stressed conditions that prevailed during the
    market disruption could recur, which could affect the
    Company’s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain
    capital.

Liquidity
    Management

Based upon the strength of its franchise, diversification of its
    businesses and strong financial fundamentals, we continue to
    believe the Company has ample liquidity to meet business
    requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but
    reasonably possible stress scenarios. The Company’s
    short-term liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, excluding cash collateral received under
    the Company’s securities lending program that has been
    reinvested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    publicly-traded securities, and cash collateral received from
    counterparties in connection with derivative instruments) was
    $17.6 billion and $11.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. We continuously monitor and adjust
    our liquidity and capital plans for the Holding Company and its
    subsidiaries in light of changing needs and opportunities.



The
    Company

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate
    adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. Liquidity needs are
    determined from a rolling

6-month

forecast by portfolio of investment assets and are monitored
    daily. Asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on the
    forecast. Cash flow testing and stress testing provide
    additional perspectives on liquidity, which include various
    scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and
    policyholder withdrawal. The Company includes provisions
    limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products, including
    general account institutional pension products (generally group
    annuities, including funding agreements, and certain deposit
    fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan sponsors.
    Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making
    withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product.

In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated
    liquidity needs, the Company has various alternatives available
    depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the
    liquidity need. These options include cash flows from
    operations, the sale of liquid assets, global funding sources
    and various credit facilities.

Under certain stressful market and economic conditions, the
    Company’s access to, or cost of, liquidity may deteriorate.
    If the Company requires significant amounts of cash on short
    notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, the Company
    may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely
    manner, be forced to sell them for less than the Company
    otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition,
    in the event of such forced sale, accounting rules require the
    recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized
    loss position and may require the impairment of other securities
    based upon the Company’s ability to hold such securities,
    which may negatively impact the Company’s financial
    condition.

In extreme circumstances, all general account assets —
    other than those which may have been pledged to a specific
    purpose — within a statutory legal entity are
    available to fund obligations of the general account within that
    legal entity.

Capital

The Company’s capital position is managed to maintain its
    financial strength and credit ratings and is supported by its
    ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating
    companies, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise
    additional capital to meet its operating and growth needs.

The Company raised new capital from its debt issuances during
    the difficult market conditions prevailing since the second half
    of 2008, as well as during the rebound and recovery periods
    beginning in the second quarter of 2009 (see “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings”). The increase in
    credit spreads experienced since then has resulted in an
    increase in the cost of such new capital, as well as increases
    in facility fees. Conversely, as a result of reductions in
    interest rates, the Company’s interest expense and
    dividends on floating rate securities have been lower.

Despite the still unsettled financial markets, the Company also
    raised new capital from a successful offering of the Holding
    Company’s common stock in August 2010, which provided
    financing for the Acquisition. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Common Stock.”

Rating Agencies.

Rating agencies assign
    insurer financial strength ratings to the Holding Company’s
    domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to the
    Holding Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The level and
    composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and
    equity capital of the Company are among the many factors
    considered in determining the Company’s insurer financial
    strength and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital
    adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally
    based on a combination of factors. In addition to heightening
    the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies,
    rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the
    frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request
    additional information from the companies that they rate and may
    adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the
    rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.



A downgrade in the credit or insurer financial strength ratings
    of the Holding Company or its subsidiaries would likely impact
    the cost and availability of financing for the Company and its
    subsidiaries and result in additional collateral requirements or
    other required payments under certain agreements, which are
    eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held
    by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements.

Statutory Capital and Dividends.

Our insurance
    subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet
    current regulatory requirements.

Except for American Life, RBC requirements are used as minimum
    capital requirements by the NAIC and the state insurance
    departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action.
    RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to
    various asset, premium and statutory reserve items. The formula
    takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer,
    including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and
    business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula
    is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible
    inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating
    regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers
    generally. These rules apply to each of the Holding
    Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries. State insurance
    laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require
    various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers
    whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC
    levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total
    adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of
    each of those RBC levels.

American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other
    domestic state and, as such, is exempt from RBC by Delaware law.
    In addition to Delaware, American Life operations are regulated
    by applicable authorities of the countries in which the company
    operates and are subject to capital and solvency requirements in
    those countries.

The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay
    to the Holding Company or other parent entities is constrained
    by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and
    provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment
    in our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain
    capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which may
    include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial
    resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain
    of these activities may require regulatory approval.
    Furthermore, the payment of dividends and other distributions to
    the Company by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by
    insurance laws and regulations. See “Business —
    U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation,”
    “— The Holding Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries”
    and Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.”

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Cash Flows from Operations.

The Company’s
    principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from
    insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A
    primary liquidity concern with respect to these



cash inflows is the risk of early contractholder and
    policyholder withdrawal. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses —
    Contractual Obligations.”

Cash Flows from Investments.

The
    Company’s principal cash inflows from its investment
    activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from
    maturities, sales of invested assets and net investment income.
    The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash
    inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market
    volatility. The Company closely monitors and manages these risks
    through its credit risk management process.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities,
    excluding: (i) cash collateral received under the
    Company’s securities lending program that has been
    reinvested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    publicly-traded securities; (ii) cash collateral received
    from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments;
    (iii) cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    securities on deposit with regulatory agencies; and
    (iv) securities held in trust in support of collateral
    financing arrangements and pledged in support of debt and
    funding agreements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company had $245.7 billion and $158.4 billion in
    liquid assets, respectively. For further discussion of invested
    assets on deposit with regulatory agencies, held in trust in
    support of collateral financing arrangements and pledged in
    support of debt and funding agreements, see “—
    Investments — Invested Assets on Deposit, Held in
    Trust and Pledged as Collateral.”

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is provided
    by a variety of short-term instruments, including funding
    agreements, credit facilities and commercial paper. Capital is
    provided by a variety of instruments, including short-term and
    long-term debt, preferred securities, junior subordinated debt
    securities and equity and equity-linked securities. The
    diversity of the Company’s funding sources enhances funding
    flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of
    funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. The Company’s
    global funding sources include:

•

The Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife
    Funding”) each have commercial paper programs supported by
    $4.0 billion in general corporate credit facilities (see
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities”).
    MetLife Funding, a subsidiary of MLIC, serves as a centralized
    finance unit for the Company. MetLife Funding raises cash from
    its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend
    loans, through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC,
    to the Holding Company, MLIC and other affiliates in order to
    enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these
    companies. Outstanding balances for the commercial paper program
    fluctuate in line with changes to affiliates’ financing
    arrangements. Pursuant to a support agreement, MLIC has agreed
    to cause MetLife Funding to have a tangible net worth of at
    least one dollar. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    MetLife Funding had a tangible net worth of $12 million. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, MetLife Funding had total
    outstanding liabilities for its commercial paper program,
    including accrued interest payable, of $102 million and
    $319 million, respectively.

•

MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing
    privileges. To utilize these privileges, MetLife Bank has
    pledged qualifying loans and investment securities to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral. At both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, MetLife Bank had no liability
    for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under
    this facility.

•

MetLife Bank has a cash need to fund residential mortgage loans
    that it originates and generally holds for a relatively short
    period before selling them to one of the government-sponsored
    enterprises such as FNMA or FHLMC. The outstanding volume of
    residential mortgage originations varies from month to month and
    is cyclical within a month. To meet the variable funding
    requirements from this mortgage activity, as well as to increase
    overall liquidity from time to time, MetLife Bank takes
    advantage of short-term collateralized borrowing opportunities
    with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB of
    NY”). MetLife Bank has entered into advances agreements
    with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank has received cash
    advances and under which the FHLB of NY has been granted a
    blanket lien on certain of MetLife Bank’s residential
    mortgages, mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MetLife Bank’s repayment obligations. Upon
    any event of default by MetLife Bank, the



FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the amount of MetLife
    Bank’s liability under the advances agreement. MetLife Bank
    has received advances from the FHLB of NY on both short- and
    long-term bases, with a total liability of $3.8 billion and
    $2.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

•

The Company also had obligations under funding agreements with
    the FHLB of NY of $12.6 billion and $13.7 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for MLIC, and
    with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB of
    Boston”) of $100 million and $326 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, for MICC. See
    Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In September 2010, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and General American Life Insurance Company,
    subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc., each became a member of the
    Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“FHLB of Des
    Moines”), and each purchased $10 million of FHLB of
    Des Moines common stock. Membership in the FHLB of Des Moines
    provides an additional source of contingent liquidity for the
    Company. There were no funding agreements with the FHLB of Des
    Moines at December 31, 2010.

•

The Company issues fixed and floating rate funding agreements,
    which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign
    currencies, to certain special purpose entities
    (“SPEs”) that have issued either debt securities or
    commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is
    secured by such funding agreements. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company issued
    $34.1 billion, $28.6 billion and $20.9 billion,
    respectively, and repaid $30.9 billion, $32.0 billion
    and $19.8 billion, respectively, of such funding
    agreements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, funding
    agreements outstanding, which are included in policyholder
    account balances, were $27.2 billion and
    $23.3 billion, respectively.

•

MLIC and MICC have each issued funding agreements to certain
    SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of
    interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements,
    and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of
    interest and principal by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage
    Corporation, a federally chartered instrumentality of the U.S.
    The obligations under these funding agreements are secured by a
    pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage
    loans and may, under certain circumstances, be secured by other
    qualified collateral. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements issued to such SPEs was $2.8 billion
    and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. The obligations under these funding agreements are
    collateralized by designated agricultural real estate mortgage
    loans with estimated fair values of $3.2 billion and
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings.

In
    connection with the financing of the Acquisition (see
    Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements), in November 2010, MetLife, Inc. issued to ALICO
    Holdings $3,000 million in three series of debt securities
    (the “Series C Debt Securities,” the
    “Series D Debt Securities” and the
    “Series E Debt Securities,” and, together, the
    “Debt Securities”), which constitute a part of the
    MetLife, Inc. common equity units (the “Equity Units”)
    more fully described in Note 14 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. The Debt Securities are
    subject to remarketing, initially bear interest at 1.56%, 1.92%
    and 2.46%, respectively (an average rate of 1.98%), and carry
    initial maturity dates of June 15, 2023, June 15, 2024
    and June 15, 2045, respectively. The interest rates will be
    reset in connection with the successful remarketings of the Debt
    Securities. Prior to the first scheduled attempted remarketing
    of the Series C Debt Securities, such Debt Securities will
    be divided into two tranches equal in principal amount with
    maturity dates of June 15, 2018 and June 15, 2023.
    Prior to the first scheduled attempted remarketing of the
    Series E Debt Securities, such Debt



Securities will be divided into two tranches equal in principal
    amount with maturity dates of June 15, 2018 and
    June 15, 2045.

In August 2010, in anticipation of the Acquisition, the Holding
    Company issued senior notes as follows:

•

$1,000 million senior notes due February 6, 2014,
    which bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.375%, payable
    semi-annually;

•

$1,000 million senior notes due February 8, 2021,
    which bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.75%, payable
    semi-annually;

•

$750 million senior notes due February 6, 2041, which
    bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.875%, payable
    semi-annually; and

•

$250 million floating rate senior notes due August 6,
    2013, which bear interest at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR,
    reset quarterly, plus 1.25%, payable quarterly.

In connection with these offerings, the Holding Company incurred
    $15 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized
    and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized
    over the terms of the senior notes.

In July 2009, the Holding Company issued $500 million of
    junior subordinated debt securities with a final maturity of
    August 2069. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate
    of 10.75% up to, but not including, August 1, 2039, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the debt securities are
    not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date,
    interest will accrue at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 7.548%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company
    incurred $5 million of issuance costs which have been
    capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being
    amortized over the term of the securities. See Note 13 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    description of the terms of the junior subordinated debt
    securities.

In May 2009, the Holding Company issued $1.3 billion of
    senior notes due June 1, 2016. The notes bear interest at a
    fixed rate of 6.75%, payable semi-annually. In connection with
    the offering, the Holding Company incurred $6 million of
    issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other
    assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the
    notes.

In March 2009, the Holding Company issued $397 million of
    floating rate senior notes due June 2012 under the FDIC’s
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The notes bear interest
    at a rate equal to three-month LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus
    0.32%. The notes are not redeemable prior to their maturity. In
    connection with the offering, the Holding Company incurred
    $15 million of issuance costs which have been capitalized
    and included in other assets. These costs are being amortized
    over the term of the notes.

In February 2009, the Holding Company remarketed its existing
    $1.0 billion 4.91% Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities as 7.717% senior debt securities, Series B,
    due 2019. In August 2008, the Holding Company remarketed its
    existing $1.0 billion 4.82% Series A junior
    subordinated debt securities as 6.817% senior debt
    securities, Series A, due 2018. Interest on both series of
    debt securities is payable semi-annually. The Series A and
    Series B junior subordinated debt securities were
    originally issued in 2005 in connection with the common equity
    units. See “— The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Remarketing of Junior Subordinated
    Debt Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.”

In April 2008, MetLife Capital Trust X, a VIE consolidated
    by the Company, issued exchangeable surplus trust securities
    (the “2008 Trust Securities”) with a face amount
    of $750 million. Interest on the 2008 Trust Securities
    or debt securities is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    9.25% up to, but not including, April 8, 2038, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the 2008
    Trust Securities or debt securities are not redeemed on or
    before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an
    annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 5.540%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a description of the terms of these
    debt securities.



Collateral Financing Arrangements.

As
    described more fully in Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of Charleston’s (“MRC”)
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution that
    referenced the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of

35-year

surplus notes issued by MRC. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus
    notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below.

Under this agreement, the Holding Company may also be required
    to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments would be
    accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and would not
    reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes.
    Such payments would, however, reduce the amount of interest
    payments due from the Holding Company under the agreement. Any
    payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution
    would reduce the receivable by an amount equal to such payment
    and would also increase the amount of interest payments due from
    the Holding Company under the agreement. In addition, the
    unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge
    collateral to the Holding Company related to any increase in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. During 2008, the
    Holding Company paid an aggregate of $800 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution relating to declines in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. The Holding Company
    did not receive any payments from the unaffiliated financial
    institution during 2008. During 2009, on a net basis, the
    Holding Company received $375 million from the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to changes in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. No payments were made or received by
    the Holding Company during 2010. Since the closing of the
    collateral financing arrangement in December 2007, on a net
    basis, the Holding Company has paid $425 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution related to changes in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. In addition, at
    December 31, 2010, the Holding Company had pledged
    collateral with an estimated fair value of $49 million to
    the unaffiliated financial institution. At December 31,
    2009, the Holding Company had no collateral pledged to the
    unaffiliated financial institution in connection with this
    agreement. The Holding Company may also be required to make a
    payment to the unaffiliated financial institution in connection
    with any early termination of this agreement.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of South Carolina’s (“MRSC”)
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under
    which the Holding Company is entitled to the return on the
    investment portfolio held by trusts established in connection
    with this collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the
    payment of a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The collateral financing
    agreement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing. The Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit
    into the trusts, related to any decline in the estimated fair
    value of the assets held by the trusts, as well as amounts
    outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the collateral
    financing arrangement. During 2010, no payments were made or
    received by the Holding Company. During 2009 and 2008, the
    Holding Company contributed $360 million and
    $320 million, respectively, as a result of declines in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in the trusts. Cumulatively,
    since May 2007, the Holding Company has contributed a total of
    $680 million as a result of declines in the estimated fair
    value of the assets in the trusts, all of which was deposited
    into the trusts.

In addition, the Holding Company may be required to pledge
    collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this
    agreement. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Holding
    Company had pledged $63 million and $80 million under
    the agreement, respectively.



Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.

In
    February 2009, the Holding Company closed the successful
    remarketing of the Series B portion of the junior
    subordinated debt securities underlying the common equity units.
    The Series B junior subordinated debt securities were
    modified as permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior
    debt securities, Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debt securities remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt. The subsequent
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts occurred on
    February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the Holding
    Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock to settle the stock purchase contracts.

In August 2008, the Holding Company closed the successful
    remarketing of the Series A portion of the junior
    subordinated debt securities underlying the common equity units.
    The Series A junior subordinated debt securities were
    modified as permitted by their terms to be 6.817% senior
    debt securities, Series A, due August 15, 2018. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debt securities remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt. The initial settlement
    of the stock purchase contracts occurred on August 15,
    2008, providing proceeds to the Holding Company of
    $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock. The Holding Company delivered
    20,244,549 shares of its common stock held in treasury at a
    value of $1,064 million to settle the stock purchase
    contracts.

Other.

In March 2009, the Company sold Cova
    Corporation, the parent company of Texas Life Insurance Company,
    for $130 million in cash consideration, excluding
    $1 million of transaction costs. The proceeds of the
    transaction were paid to the Holding Company.

Credit and Committed Facilities.

The Company
    maintains unsecured credit facilities and committed facilities,
    which aggregated $4.0 billion and $12.4 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2010. When drawn upon, these
    facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the
    respective agreements.

The unsecured credit facilities are used for general corporate
    purposes, to support the borrowers’ commercial paper
    programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding
    $1.5 billion in letters of credit and no drawdowns against
    these facilities. Remaining unused commitments were
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010.

The committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of
    the Company’s affiliated reinsurance liabilities. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had outstanding
    $5.4 billion in letters of credit and $2.8 billion in
    aggregate drawdowns against these facilities. Remaining unused
    commitments were $4.2 billion at December 31, 2010.

See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of these facilities.

We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties
    will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual
    obligations under these facilities. As commitments associated
    with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire
    unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.

As a result of the successful offerings of certain senior notes
    and common stock in August 2010, the commitment letter for a
    $5.0 billion senior credit facility, which the Holding
    Company signed to partially finance the Acquisition, was
    terminated. During March 2010, the Holding Company paid
    $28 million in fees related to this senior credit facility,
    all of which were expensed during the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

Covenants.

Certain of the Company’s debt
    instruments, credit facilities and committed facilities contain
    various administrative, reporting, legal and financial
    covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all
    covenants at December 31, 2010 and 2009.



Preferred Stock.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Holding Company did not issue any
    non-convertible preferred stock. In December 2008, the Holding
    Company entered into a replacement capital covenant (the
    “Replacement Capital Covenant”) whereby the Company
    agreed for the benefit of holders of one or more series of the
    Company’s unsecured long-term indebtedness designated from
    time to time by the Company in accordance with the terms of the
    Replacement Capital Covenant (“Covered Debt”), that
    the Company will not repay, redeem or purchase and will cause
    its subsidiaries not to repay, redeem or purchase, on or before
    the termination of the Replacement Capital Covenant on
    December 31, 2018 (or earlier termination by agreement of
    the holders of Covered Debt or when there is no longer any
    outstanding series of unsecured long-term indebtedness which
    qualifies for designation as “Covered Debt”), the
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, of
    the Holding Company or the 6.500% Non-Cumulative Preferred
    Stock, Series B, of the Holding Company, unless such
    repayment, redemption or purchase is made from the proceeds of
    the issuance of certain replacement capital securities and
    pursuant to the other terms and conditions set forth in the
    Replacement Capital Covenant.

Convertible Preferred Stock.

In November 2010,
    the Holding Company issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with
    the financing of the Acquisition 6,857,000 shares of
    Series B contingent convertible junior participating
    non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (the “Convertible
    Preferred Stock”) convertible into approximately
    68,570,000 shares (valued at $40.90 per share at the time
    of the Acquisition) of the Holding Company’s common stock
    (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) upon a favorable vote of
    the Holding Company’s common stockholders. If a favorable
    vote of its common stockholders is not obtained by the first
    anniversary of the Acquisition Date, then the Holding Company
    must pay ALICO Holdings $300 million and use reasonable
    efforts to list the preferred stock on NYSE. Management
    considers the likelihood that the Holding Company will fail to
    obtain a vote of its common stockholders to be remote.

Common Stock.

In November 2010, the Holding
    Company issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the
    financing of the Acquisition 78,239,712 new shares of its common
    stock at $40.90 per share. The aggregate amount of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock to be issued to ALICO Holdings in
    connection with the transaction is expected to be
    214.6 million to 231.5 million shares, consisting of
    the 78.2 million shares issued at closing,
    68.6 million shares to be issued upon conversion of the
    Convertible Preferred Stock (with the stockholder vote on such
    conversion to be held within one year after the closing)
    (together with $3.0 billion aggregate stated amount of
    Equity Units of MetLife, Inc., the “Securities”) and
    between 67.8 million and 84.7 million shares of common
    stock, in total, issuable upon settlement of the purchase
    contracts forming part of the Equity Units (in three tranches
    approximately two, three and four years after the closing). The
    ownership of the Securities is subject to an investor rights
    agreement, which grants to ALICO Holdings certain rights and
    sets forth certain agreements with respect to ALICO
    Holdings’ ownership, voting and transfer of the Securities,
    including minimum holding periods, restrictions on the number of
    shares ALICO Holdings can sell at one time, its agreement to
    vote the common stock in the same proportion as the common stock
    voted by all other stockholders, and its agreement not to seek
    control or influence the Company’s management or Board of
    Directors. ALICO Holdings has indicated that it intends to
    monetize the Securities over time, subject to market conditions,
    following the lapse of

agreed-upon

minimum holding periods. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Equity Units.”

In August 2010, the Holding Company issued 86,250,000 new shares
    of its common stock at a price of $42.00 per share for gross
    proceeds of $3,623 million. In connection with the offering
    of common stock, the Holding Company incurred $94 million
    of issuance costs which have been recorded as a reduction of
    additional

paid-in-capital.

In connection with the remarketing of the junior subordinated
    debt securities, in February 2009, the Holding Company delivered
    24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common stock, and in
    August 2008, the Holding Company delivered
    20,244,549 shares of its common stock from treasury stock,
    to settle the stock purchase contracts. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.”

In October 2008, the Holding Company issued
    86,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $26.50
    per share for gross proceeds of $2.3 billion. Of these
    shares issued, 75,000,000 shares were issued from treasury
    stock, and 11,250,000 were newly issued shares.



During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    332,121 shares, 861,586 shares and
    2,271,188 shares of common stock were issued from treasury
    stock for $18 million, $46 million and
    $118 million, respectively, to satisfy various stock option
    exercises. During the year ended December 31, 2010,
    2,182,174 new shares of common stock were issued for
    $74 million to satisfy various stock option exercises.
    During both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, no
    new shares of common stock were issued to satisfy stock option
    exercises.

Equity Units.

In November 2010, the Holding
    Company issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the
    financing of the Acquisition $3.0 billion aggregate stated
    amount of Equity Units. The Equity Units, which are mandatorily
    convertible securities, will initially consist of
    (i) purchase contracts obligating the holder to purchase a
    variable number of shares of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    on each of three specified future settlement dates (expected to
    be approximately two, three and four years after closing of the
    Acquisition), for a fixed amount per purchase contract, (an
    aggregate of $1.0 billion on each settlement date) and
    (ii) an interest in each of three series of Debt Securities
    of MetLife, Inc. The value of the purchase contracts at issuance
    of $247 million was calculated as the present value of the
    future contract payments and was recorded in other liabilities.
    At future dates, the Series C, D and E Debt Securities will
    be subject to remarketing and sold to investors. Holders of the
    Equity Units who elect to include their Debt Securities in a
    remarketing can use the proceeds thereof to meet their
    obligations under the purchase contracts.

See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of the Equity Units.

Debt Repayments.

During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank made
    repayments of $349 million, $497 million and
    $371 million, respectively, to the FHLB of NY related to
    long-term borrowings. During the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank made repayments to the FHLB of
    NY related to short-term borrowings of $12.9 billion,
    $26.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. During
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank
    made repayments related to short-term borrowings to the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York of $21.2 billion and
    650 million, respectively. No repayments were made to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the year ended
    December 31, 2010. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, MICC made repayments of $300 million to the FHLB of
    Boston related to short-term borrowings. No repayments were made
    to the FHLB of Boston during the years ended December 31,
    2010 and 2008.

Debt Repurchases.

We may from time to time
    seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash
    purchases

and/or

exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases,
    privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such
    repurchases or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors,
    including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions,
    general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and
    accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase any debt and
    the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined
    in the Company’s discretion.

Insurance Liabilities.

The Company’s
    principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities
    associated with its various life insurance, property and
    casualty, annuity and group pension products, operating expenses
    and income tax, as well as principal and interest on its
    outstanding debt obligations. Liabilities arising from its
    insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under
    the aforementioned products, as well as payments for policy



surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type
    products, surrender or lapse product behavior differs somewhat
    by segment. In the Retirement Products segment, which includes
    individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the
    normal course of business. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, general account surrenders and
    withdrawals from annuity products were $3.8 billion and
    $4.3 billion, respectively. In the Corporate Benefit
    Funding segment, which includes pension closeouts, bank owned
    life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as
    funding agreements (including funding agreements with the FHLB
    of NY and the FHLB of Boston) and other capital market products,
    most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly
    predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to Corporate
    Benefit Funding liabilities that provide customers with limited
    liquidity rights, at December 31, 2010 there were
    $1,615 million of funding agreements and other capital
    market products that could be put back to the Company after a
    period of notice. Of these liabilities, $1,565 million were
    subject to notice periods between 15 and 90 days. The
    remainder of the balance was subject to a notice period of
    9 months or greater. An additional $375 million of
    Corporate Benefit Funding liabilities were subject to credit
    ratings downgrade triggers that permit early termination subject
    to a notice period of 90 days. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses —
    Contractual Obligations.”

    consideration factors such as the Company’s current
    earnings, expected medium- and long-term earnings, financial
    condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable
    governmental regulations and policies. Furthermore, the payment
    of dividends and other distributions to the Holding Company by
    its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and
    regulations.

Share Repurchases.

At January 1, 2008,
    the Company had $511 million remaining under its common
    stock repurchase program authorizations. In both January and
    April 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    $1.0 billion common stock repurchase programs. During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased
    19,716,418 shares for $1.2 billion under accelerated
    share repurchases and 1,550,000 shares for $88 million
    in open market repurchases. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had $1.3 billion remaining under its common stock
    repurchase program authorizations. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company did not repurchase
    any shares.

Under these common stock repurchase program authorizations, the
    Holding Company may purchase its common stock from the MetLife
    Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to
    the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated
    transactions. Any future common stock repurchases will be
    dependent upon several factors, including the Company’s
    capital position, its liquidity, its financial strength and
    credit ratings, general market conditions and the price of
    MetLife, Inc.’s common stock compared to management’s
    assessment of the stock’s underlying value and applicable
    regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to
    purchase any common stock and the size and timing of any such
    purchases will be determined in the Company’s complete
    discretion.

Residential Mortgage Loans

Held-for-Sale.

At
    December 31, 2010, the Company held $3,321 million in
    residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

compared with $2,728 million at December 31, 2009, an
    increase of $593 million. From time to time, MetLife Bank
    has an increased cash need to fund mortgage loans that it
    generally holds for a relatively short period before selling
    them to one of the government-sponsored enterprises such as FNMA
    or FHLMC. To meet these increased funding requirements, as well
    as to increase overall liquidity, MetLife Bank takes advantage
    of collateralized borrowing opportunities with the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York and the FHLB of NY. For further detail
    on MetLife Bank’s use of these funding sources, see
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Global Funding Sources.”

Investment and Other.

Additional cash outflows
    include those related to obligations of securities lending
    activities, investments in real estate, limited partnerships and
    joint ventures, as well as litigation-related liabilities. Also,
    the Company pledges collateral to, and has collateral pledged to
    it by, counterparties under the Company’s current
    derivative transactions. With respect to derivative transactions
    with credit ratings downgrade triggers, a two-



notch downgrade would have increased the Company’s
    derivative collateral requirements by $159 million at
    December 31, 2010. In addition, the Company has pledged
    collateral and has had collateral pledged to it, and may be
    required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be
    entitled to have additional collateral pledged to it, in
    connection with collateral financing arrangements related to the
    reinsurance of closed block liabilities and universal life
    secondary guarantee liabilities. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Collateral Financing Arrangements.”

Securities Lending.

The Company participates
    in a securities lending program whereby blocks of securities,
    which are included in fixed maturity securities and short-term
    investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage
    firms and commercial banks, and the Company receives cash
    collateral from the borrower, which must be returned to the
    borrower when the loaned securities are returned to the Company.
    Under the Company’s securities lending program, the Company
    was liable for cash collateral under its control of
    $24.6 billion and $21.5 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Of these amounts, $2.8 billion
    and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, were on open terms, meaning that the related
    loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next
    business day upon return of cash collateral. Of the
    $2.7 billion of estimated fair value of the securities
    related to the cash collateral on open terms at
    December 31, 2010, $2.3 billion were
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities
    which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy
    the cash requirements. See “— Investments —
    Securities Lending” for further information.

Other.

In September 2008, in connection with
    the split-off of Reinsurance Group of America (“RGA”)
    as described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the Company received from MetLife
    stockholders 23,093,689 shares of MetLife, Inc.’s
    common stock with a market value of $1.3 billion and, in
    exchange, delivered 29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B
    common stock with a net book value of $1.7 billion
    resulting in a loss on disposition, including transaction costs,
    of $458 million.

    include liabilities related to traditional whole life policies,
    term life policies, pension closeout and other group annuity
    contracts, structured settlements, master terminal funding
    agreements, single premium immediate annuities, long-term
    disability policies, individual disability income policies, LTC
    policies and property and casualty contracts. Included within
    future policy benefits are contracts where the Company is
    currently making payments and will continue to do so until the
    occurrence of a specific event such as death, as well as those
    where the timing of a portion of the payments has been
    determined









Separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above.
    Generally, the separate account owner, rather than the Company,
    bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account
    assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims
    that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully
    offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders
    whose liability is reflected with the separate account
    liabilities. Separate account liabilities are fully funded by
    cash flows from the separate account assets and are set equal to
    the estimated fair value of separate account assets.

The Company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and
    services in the normal course of business; however, these
    purchase obligations were not material to its consolidated
    results of operations or financial position at December 31,
    2010.

Additionally, the Company has agreements in place for services
    it conducts, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to
    insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. Intercompany
    transactions have appropriately been eliminated in
    consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance
    subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the
    appropriate departments of insurance as required.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company and
    several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are
    parties to various capital support commitments, guarantees and
    contingent reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of
    the Holding Company and a corporation in which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, each
    Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to
    cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels,
    has guaranteed certain contractual obligations or has agreed to
    provide, upon the occurrence of certain contingencies,
    reinsurance for such entity’s insurance liabilities. We
    anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place
    demands upon the Company, there will be sufficient liquidity and
    capital to enable the Company to meet anticipated demands. See
    “— The Holding Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Support Agreements.”

Litigation.

Putative or certified class action
    litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments
    against the Company, in addition to those discussed elsewhere
    herein and those otherwise provided for in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of
    the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, in
    connection with its activities as an insurer, mortgage lending
    bank, employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer.
    Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other
    federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and
    conduct investigations concerning the Company’s compliance
    with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome
    of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of
    the matters referred to herein, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcome of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse



outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated net
    income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and
    Financial Holding Companies.

The Holding Company
    and its insured depository institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank,
    are subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines issued
    by the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and bank
    and financial holding companies. The federal banking regulatory
    agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective
    actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum
    capital standards. As of their most recently filed reports with
    the federal banking regulatory agencies, the Holding Company and
    MetLife Bank met the minimum capital standards as per federal
    banking regulatory agencies with all of MetLife Bank’s
    risk-based and leverage capital ratios meeting the federal
    banking regulatory agencies “well capitalized”
    standards and all of the Holding Company’s risk-based and
    leverage capital ratios meeting the “adequately
    capitalized” standards. In addition to requirements which
    may be imposed in connection with the implementation of
    Dodd-Frank, if endorsed and adopted in the U.S., Basel III
    will also lead to increased capital and liquidity requirements
    for bank holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc. See
    “— Industry Trends — Financial and
    Economic Environment— Regulatory Changes.”

Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and
    Capital.

For information regarding the primary
    sources and uses of Holding Company liquidity and capital, see
    “— The Company — Capital
    — Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and
    Capital.”

Liquidity
    and Capital

Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable
    and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and
    future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of
    sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified
    mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale
    financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and
    committed credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active
    participant in the global financial markets through which it
    obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which
    serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical
    components of the Holding Company’s liquidity and capital
    management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon
    relative costs, prospective views of balance



sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital
    structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit the
    Holding Company’s access to liquidity.

The Holding Company’s ability to maintain regular access to
    competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current
    credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view
    our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings
    streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity
    monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit
    ratings. See “— The Company —
    Capital — Rating Agencies.”

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity
    risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid
    asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow
    obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and
    debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the
    Holding Company’s liquidity.

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Dividends from Subsidiaries.

The Holding
    Company relies in part on dividends from its subsidiaries to
    meet its cash requirements. The Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their
    respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the
    surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding
    calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting
    practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various
    states in which the Company conducts business, differ in certain
    respects from accounting principles used in financial statements
    prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences
    relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax,
    required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation
    assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.

The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by
    the respective insurance subsidiary without insurance regulatory
    approval and the respective dividends paid:

Includes shares of an affiliate distributed to the Holding
    Company as an in-kind dividend of $164 million.

In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, cash
    dividends in the aggregate amount of $0, $215 million and
    $235 million, respectively, were paid to the Holding
    Company.

The dividend capacity of

non-U.S. operations

is subject to similar restrictions established by the local
    regulators. The

non-U.S. regulatory

regimes also commonly limit the dividend payments to the parent
    to a portion of the prior year’s statutory income, as
    determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of
    the

non-U.S. operations,

including the Japan branch of American Life, may also limit or
    not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to
    the U.S. if such transfers would be detrimental to the solvency
    or financial strength of the operations of the

non-U.S. operations,

or for other reasons. Most of the

non-U.S. subsidiaries

are second tier subsidiaries and are not directly owned by the
    Holding Company. The capital and rating considerations
    applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the
    dividend flow into the Holding Company.

The Company’s management actively manages its target and
    excess capital levels and dividend flows on a pro-active basis
    and forecasts local capital positions as part of the financial
    planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and

non-U.S. subsidiaries

is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum
    capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of
    financial strength in the relevant market. Management of the
    Holding Company cannot provide assurances that the Holding
    Company’s subsidiaries will have statutory earnings to
    support payment of dividends to the Holding Company in an amount
    sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends
    and that the applicable regulators will not disapprove any
    dividends that such subsidiaries must submit for approval. See
    Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities,
    excluding: (i) cash collateral received under the
    Company’s securities lending program that has been
    reinvested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    publicly-traded securities; and (ii) cash collateral
    received from counterparties in connection with derivative
    instruments. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Holding
    Company had $2.8 billion and $3.8 billion,
    respectively, in liquid assets. In addition, the Holding Company
    has pledged collateral and has had collateral pledged to it, and
    may be required from time to time to pledge additional
    collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged
    to it. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Holding Company
    had pledged $362 million and $289 million,
    respectively, of liquid assets under collateral support
    agreements.

Shelf Registration.

In November 2010, the
    Holding Company filed a shelf registration statement (the
    “2010 Shelf Registration Statement”) with the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”),
    which was automatically effective upon filing, in accordance
    with SEC rules. SEC rules also allow for pay-as-you-go fees and
    the ability to add securities by filing automatically effective
    amendments for companies, such as the Holding Company, which
    qualify as “Well-Known Seasoned Issuers.” The 2010
    Shelf Registration Statement registered an unlimited amount of
    debt and equity securities and replaces the shelf registration
    statement that the Holding Company filed in November 2007, which
    expired in the fourth quarter of 2010. The terms of any offering
    will be established at the time of the offering.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of short-term instruments, including
    commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of
    instruments, including medium- and long-term debt, junior
    subordinated debt securities, collateral financing arrangements,
    capital securities and stockholders’ equity. The diversity
    of the Holding Company’s funding sources enhances funding
    flexibility, limits dependence on any one source of funds and
    generally lowers the cost of funds. Other sources of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity include programs for short-and
    long-term borrowing, as needed.

We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital
    plans for the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in light of
    changing requirements and market conditions.

Short-term Debt.

MetLife, Inc. maintains a
    commercial paper program, proceeds of which can be used to
    finance the general liquidity needs of MetLife, Inc. and its
    subsidiaries. The Holding Company had no short-term debt
    outstanding at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. There was
    no short-term debt activity in 2010. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average interest
    rate on short-term debt, comprised only of commercial paper, was
    1.25% and 2.5%, respectively. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the average daily balance on short-term
    debt was $5 million, and the average days outstanding was
    6 days.

Collateral Financing Arrangements.

For
    information on collateral financing arrangements entered into by
    the Holding Company, see “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Collateral Financing Arrangements.”

Credit and Committed Facilities.

At
    December 31, 2010, the Holding Company, along with MetLife
    Funding, maintained $4.0 billion in unsecured credit
    facilities, the proceeds of which are available to be used for
    general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers’
    commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of
    credit. At December 31, 2010, the Holding Company had
    outstanding $1.5 billion in letters of credit and no
    drawdowns against this facility. Remaining unused commitments
    were $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010.

The Holding Company maintains committed facilities with a
    capacity of $300 million. At December 31, 2010, the
    Holding Company had outstanding $300 million in letters of
    credit and no drawdowns against these facilities. There were no
    remaining unused commitments at December 31, 2010. In
    addition, the Holding Company is a party to committed facilities
    of certain of its subsidiaries, which aggregated
    $12.1 billion at December 31, 2010. The committed
    facilities are used as collateral for certain of the
    Company’s affiliated reinsurance liabilities.

See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further detail on these facilities.

Covenants.

Certain of the Holding
    Company’s debt instruments, credit facilities and committed
    facilities contain various administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants. The Holding Company believes it was in
    compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Preferred Stock, Convertible Preferred Stock, Common Stock
    and Equity Units.

For information on preferred
    stock, convertible preferred stock, common stock and common
    equity units issued by the Holding Company, see
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Preferred Stock,”
    “— Convertible Preferred Stock,”
    “— Common Stock,” and
    “— Equity Units,” respectively.

Liquidity
    and Capital Uses

The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include
    debt service, cash dividends on preferred, convertible preferred
    and common stock, capital contributions to subsidiaries, payment
    of general operating expenses and acquisitions. Based on our
    analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows
    from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are
    permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory
    approval, our asset portfolio and other cash flows and
    anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will
    be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the Holding
    Company to make payments on debt, make cash dividend payments on
    its preferred, convertible preferred and common stock,
    contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay all general
    operating expenses and meet its cash needs.

Acquisitions.

For information regarding the
    purchase price of the Acquisition, see “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses —
    Acquisitions.”

Affiliated Capital Transactions.

During the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Holding
    Company invested an aggregate of $699 million (excludes the
    Acquisition), $986 million and $2.6 billion,
    respectively, in various subsidiaries.

The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. Such loans are included in loans to subsidiaries
    and consisted of the following at:

Debt Repayments.

The Holding Company intends
    to either repay all or refinance in whole or in part the debt
    that is due in December 2011. See “— The Holding
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Senior Notes.”

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company is
    party to various capital support commitments and guarantees with
    certain of its subsidiaries and a corporation in which it owns
    50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, the Holding Company
    has agreed to cause each such entity to meet specified capital
    and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations.

In November 2010, the Holding Company guaranteed the obligations
    of Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd. (“Exeter”) in an
    aggregate amount up to $1.0 billion, under a reinsurance
    agreement with MetLife Europe Limited (“MEL”), under
    which Exeter reinsures the guaranteed living benefits and
    guaranteed death benefits associated with certain unit-linked
    annuity contracts issued by MEL.

In January 2010, the Holding Company guaranteed the obligations
    of its subsidiary, Missouri Reinsurance (Barbados) Inc.
    (“MoRe”), under a retrocession agreement with RGA
    Reinsurance (Barbados) Inc., pursuant to which MoRe retrocedes
    certain group term life insurance issued by MLIC.

In December 2009, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont (“MRV”)’s
    reinsurance of certain universal life and term life insurance
    risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause the third protected cell of MRV to
    maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200% of
    such protected cell’s authorized control level RBC, as
    defined in state insurance statutes. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Credit and Committed Facilities” and Note 11 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with MRV’s reinsurance
    of certain universal life and term life insurance risks,
    committed to the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
    Securities and Health Care Administration to take necessary
    action to cause each of the two initial protected cells of MRV
    to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200%
    of such protected cell’s authorized control level RBC,
    as defined in state insurance statutes. See
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” and
    Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with the collateral financing
    arrangement associated with MRC’s reinsurance of a portion
    of the liabilities associated with the closed block, committed
    to the South Carolina Department of Insurance to make capital
    contributions, if necessary, to MRC so that MRC may at all times
    maintain its total adjusted capital at a level of not less than
    200% of the company action level RBC, as defined in state
    insurance statutes as in effect on the date of determination or
    December 31, 2007, whichever calculation produces the
    greater capital requirement, or as otherwise required by the
    South Carolina Department of Insurance. See
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings”
    and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with the collateral financing
    arrangement associated with MRSC’s reinsurance of universal
    life secondary guarantees, committed to the South Carolina
    Department of Insurance to take necessary action to cause MRSC
    to maintain total adjusted capital equal to the greater of
    $250,000 or 100% of MRSC’s authorized control
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes. See
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings”
    and Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by
    state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it
    to meet its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSI MetLife”), an investment in Japan of which the
    Holding Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the
    Holding Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to
    cause MSI



MetLife to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for
    MSI MetLife to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as
    calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Law of
    Japan, and to make such loans to MSI MetLife as may be necessary
    to ensure that MSI MetLife has sufficient cash or other liquid
    assets to meet its payment obligations as they fall due. As
    described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the Holding Company reached an agreement
    to sell its 50% interest in MSI MetLife to a third-party. Upon
    the close of such sale, the Holding Company’s obligations
    under the net worth maintenance agreement will terminate.

The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter, under a reinsurance agreement with MSI
    MetLife, under which Exeter reinsures variable annuity business
    written by MSI MetLife. This guarantee will remain in place
    until such time as the reinsurance agreement between Exeter and
    MSI MetLife is terminated, notwithstanding any prior disposition
    of the Holding Company’s interest in MSI MetLife as
    described in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

The Holding Company also guarantees the obligations of a number
    of its subsidiaries under credit facilities with third-party
    banks. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Dividends

On February 18, 2011, the Holding Company announced
    dividends of $0.2500000 per share, for a total of
    $6 million, on its Series A preferred shares, and
    $0.4062500 per share, for a total of $24 million, on its
    Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 7, 2011. Both
    dividends will be payable March 15, 2011 to shareholders of
    record as of February 28, 2011.

Credit
    Facility

On February 1, 2011, the Holding Company entered into a
    committed facility with a third-party bank to provide letters of
    credit for the benefit of MoRe, a captive reinsurance
    subsidiary, to address its short-term solvency needs based on
    guidance from the regulator. This one-year facility provides for
    the issuance of letters of credit in amounts up to
    $350 million. Under the facility, a letter of credit for
    $250 million was issued on February 2, 2011 and
    increased to $295 million on February 23, 2011, which
    management believes satisfies MoRe’s solvency requirements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Risk
    Management

The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the
    market risk associated with its assets and liabilities. It has
    developed an integrated process for managing risk, which it
    conducts through its Enterprise Risk Management Department,
    Asset/Liability Management Unit, Treasury Department and
    Investment Department along with the management of the business
    segments. The Company has established and implemented
    comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and
    business segment level to minimize the effects of potential
    market volatility.

The Company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate,
    equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As
    a result of that analysis, the Company has determined that the
    estimated fair values of certain



assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in
    interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in
    the equity markets.

Enterprise Risk Management.

MetLife has
    established several financial and non-financial senior
    management committees as part of its risk management process.
    These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve ALM
    strategies and establish appropriate corporate business
    standards. Further enhancing its committee structure, during the
    second quarter of 2010, MetLife created an Enterprise Risk
    Committee made up of the following voting members: the Chief
    Financial Officer, the Chief Investment Officer, the President
    of U.S. Business, the President of International and the
    Chief Risk Officer. This committee is responsible for reviewing
    all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions if
    necessary, in the event risks exceed desirable targets, taking
    into consideration best practices to resolve or mitigate those
    risks.

MetLife also has a separate Enterprise Risk Management
    Department, which is responsible for risk management throughout
    MetLife and reports to MetLife’s Chief Risk Officer. The
    Enterprise Risk Management Department’s primary
    responsibilities consist of:

•

implementing a corporate risk framework, which outlines the
    Company’s approach for managing risk on an enterprise-wide
    basis;

•

developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring,
    monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the
    corporate risk framework;

•

establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;

•

deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and

•

reporting on a periodic basis to the Finance and Risk Committee
    of the Company’s Board of Directors; with respect to credit
    risk, to the Investment Committee of the Company’s Board of
    Directors; and, reporting on various aspects of risk, to
    financial and non-financial senior management committees.

Asset/Liability Management.

The Company
    actively manages its assets using an approach that balances
    quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity,
    concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment
    process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring
    that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The ALM process is the shared
    responsibility of the Financial Risk Management and
    Asset/Liability Management Unit, Enterprise Risk Management, the
    Portfolio Management Unit, and the senior members of the
    business segments and is governed by the ALM Committees. The ALM
    Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving target
    portfolios, establishing investment guidelines and limits and
    providing oversight of the ALM process on a periodic basis. The
    directives of the ALM Committees are carried out and monitored
    through ALM Working Groups which are set up to manage by product
    type. In addition, an ALM Steering Committee oversees the
    activities of the underlying ALM Committees.

MetLife establishes target asset portfolios for each major
    insurance product, which represent the investment strategies
    used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels
    of risk. These strategies are monitored through regular review
    of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve
    sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration
    and credit quality by the ALM Working Groups.

Market
    Risk Exposures

The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance
    operations and investment activities. For purposes of this
    disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of
    loss resulting from changes in interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates and equity market.

Interest Rates.

The Company’s exposure to
    interest rate changes results most significantly from its
    holdings of fixed maturity securities, as well as its interest
    rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities
    include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities
    issued by government agencies, corporate bonds and
    mortgage-backed securities, all of which are mainly exposed to
    changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest
    rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure
    include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain
    investment type contracts, and net embedded derivatives on
    variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits



which have the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and
    long-term interest rates) as fixed maturity securities. The
    Company employs product design, pricing and ALM strategies to
    reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements. Product
    design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender
    charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the
    ability to reset credited rates for certain products. ALM
    strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch
    limits. See “Risk Factors — Changes in Market
    Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.

The
    Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its
    holdings in

non-U.S. dollar

denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage
    loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies
    that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the
    Company’s investment portfolios are the Euro, the Japanese
    yen and the Canadian dollar. The principal currencies that
    create foreign currency risk in the Company’s liabilities
    are the British pound, the Euro and the Swiss franc.
    Selectively, the Company uses U.S. dollar assets to support
    certain long duration foreign currency liabilities. Through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, the
    Company is primarily exposed to the Mexican peso, the Japanese
    yen, the South Korean won, the Canadian dollar, the British
    pound, the Chilean peso, the Australian dollar, the Argentine
    peso, the Polish zloty, the Euro and the Hong Kong dollar. In
    addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps, forwards and
    options, local surplus in some countries is held entirely or in
    part in U.S. dollar assets which further minimizes exposure
    to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. The Company
    has matched much of its foreign currency liabilities in its
    foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency
    assets, thereby reducing its risk to foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuation. See “Risk Factors —
    Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively
    Affect Our Profitability.”

Equity Market.

The Company has exposure to
    equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve
    long-term guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded
    derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
    benefits, certain policyholder account balances along with
    investments in equity securities. We manage this risk on an
    integrated basis with other risks through our ALM strategies
    including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity
    guarantee benefits. The Company also manages equity market risk
    exposure in its investment portfolio through the use of
    derivatives. Equity exposures associated with other limited
    partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are
    not considered financial instruments under GAAP.

Management
    of Market Risk Exposures

The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest
    rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk,
    including the use of derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk Management.

To manage
    interest rate risk, the Company analyzes interest rate risk
    using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow
    projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities
    and their supporting investments, including derivative
    instruments. These projections involve evaluating the potential
    gain or loss on most of the Company’s in-force business
    under various increasing and decreasing interest rate
    environments. The New York State Insurance Department
    regulations require that MetLife perform some of these analyses
    annually as part of MetLife’s review of the sufficiency of
    its regulatory reserves. For several of its legal entities, the
    Company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset
    portfolios for the purpose of ALM and the allocation of
    investment income to product lines. For each segment, invested
    assets greater than or equal to the GAAP liabilities less the
    DAC asset and any non-invested assets allocated to the segment
    are maintained, with any excess swept to the surplus segment.
    The business segments may reflect differences in legal entity,
    statutory line of business and any product market characteristic
    which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to
    duration, liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets.
    Certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general
    accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the
    aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities. The
    Company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its
    assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing
    Company models. These models reflect specific product
    characteristics and include assumptions based on current and
    anticipated experience regarding lapse, mortality and interest
    crediting rates. In addition, these models include asset cash
    flow projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund
    payments, principal payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments
    and defaults.



Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are
    also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and
    liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the
    duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all
    policyholder guarantees and to how the Company intends to set
    indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or
    dividends. Each asset portfolio has a duration target based on
    the liability duration and the investment objectives of that
    portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity
    of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement and
    non-medical health products, the Company may support such
    liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or curve
    mismatch strategies.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
    Management.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk
    is assumed primarily in three ways: investments in foreign
    subsidiaries, purchases of foreign currency denominated
    investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain
    insurance products.

•

The Company’s Treasury Department is responsible for
    managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries.
    Limits to exposures are established and monitored by the
    Treasury Department and managed by the Investment Department.

•

The Investment Department is responsible for managing the
    exposure to foreign currency investments. Exposure limits to
    unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the
    standing authorizations granted to management by the Board of
    Directors and are reported to the Board of Directors on a
    periodic basis.

•

The lines of business are responsible for establishing limits
    and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the
    sale or issuance of insurance products.

MetLife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its
    foreign currency denominated fixed income investments, its
    equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency
    exposures caused by the sale of insurance products.

Equity Market Risk Management.

Equity market
    risk exposure through the issuance of variable annuities is
    managed by the Company’s Asset/Liability Management Unit in
    partnership with the Investment Department. Equity market risk
    is realized through its investment in equity securities and is
    managed by its Investment Department. MetLife uses derivatives
    to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability
    guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
    benefit and equity securities. These derivatives include
    exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts
    and equity variance swaps. The Company also employs reinsurance
    to manage these exposures.

Hedging Activities.

MetLife uses derivative
    contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including
    interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, and equity risk.
    Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic
    basis while considering their impact on accounting results and
    GAAP and Statutory capital. The construction of the
    Company’s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the
    type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or
    liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce
    risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. The
    Company’s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as
    follows:

•

Risks Related to Living Guarantee Benefits — The
    Company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the
    risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits.
    These hedges include equity and interest rate futures, interest
    rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options
    and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.

•

Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees — For certain Company
    liability contracts, the Company provides the contractholder a
    guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include
    certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. The
    Company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated
    with these liability guarantees.

•

Reinvestment Risk in Long Duration Liability
    Contracts — Derivatives are used to hedge interest
    rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts,
    such as deferred annuities. Hedges include zero coupon interest
    rate swaps and swaptions.



•

Foreign Currency Risk — The Company uses currency
    swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk. These hedges
    primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments
    in foreign subsidiaries or equity exposures to U.S. dollars.

•

General ALM Hedging Strategies — In the ordinary
    course of managing the Company’s asset/liability risks, the
    Company uses interest rate futures, interest rate swaps,
    interest rate caps, interest rate floors and inflation swaps.
    These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or
    inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or
    related to expected future cash flows.

Risk
    Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis

The Company measures market risk related to its market sensitive
    assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates,
    equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a
    sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential
    changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity market
    prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes
    that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates
    and prices is reasonably possible in the near-term. In
    performing the analysis summarized below, the Company used
    market rates at December 31, 2010. The sensitivity analysis
    separately calculates each of the Company’s market risk
    exposures (interest rate, equity market and foreign currency
    exchange rate) relating to its trading and non-trading assets
    and liabilities. The Company modeled the impact of changes in
    market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its
    market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows:

•

the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures
    resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates;

•

the U.S. dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the
    Company’s foreign currency exposures due to a 10% change
    (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange
    rates; and

•

the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.

The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed
    as predictive of the Company’s future financial
    performance. The Company cannot ensure that its actual losses in
    any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in
    the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity
    analysis include:

•

the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and
    parameters established in creating the related sensitivity
    analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages;

•

for the derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on
    reported earnings may be materially different from the change in
    market values;

•

the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and
    liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and

•

the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities
    remains unchanged throughout the period.

Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not as
    substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management.
    Based on its analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or
    decrease) in market rates and prices, MetLife has determined
    that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the
    estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from
    interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity
    exposures.

The table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair
    value for each market risk exposure of the Company’s market
    sensitive assets and liabilities at December 31, 2010:

This quantitative measure of risk has increased by
    $1,325 million, or 33%, to $5,382 million at
    December 31, 2010 from $4,057 million at
    December 31, 2009. Excluding the Acquisition which
    increased risk by $647 million, the quantitative measure of
    risk increased by $678 million or 17% at December 31,
    2010 from December 31, 2009. The increase in risk is due to
    a change in the net assets and liabilities bases of
    $641 million. In addition, an increase of $954 million
    was due to the use of derivatives employed by the Company
    ($445 million), an increase in the duration of the
    investment portfolio ($389 million), and an increase in
    premiums, reinsurance and other receivables ($120 million).
    This increase in risk was partially offset by a decrease in
    interest rates across the long end of the Swaps and
    U.S. Treasury curves resulting in a decrease of
    $424 million. Additionally, net embedded derivatives within
    liability host contracts increased by $520 million,
    partially due to a change made in the second quarter of 2010
    related to how the Company estimates the spread over the swap
    curve for purposes of determining the discount rate used to
    value those derivatives, which caused a corresponding decrease
    in risk. The remainder of the fluctuation is attributable to
    numerous immaterial items.

Embedded derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheet in the same caption as the host contract.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk increased by
    $3,124 million, to $4,015 million at December 31,
    2010 from $891 million at December 31, 2009. Excluding
    the Acquisition which increased risk by $2,646 million, the
    foreign currency exchange risk has increased by
    $478 million or 54% at December 31, 2010 from
    December 31, 2009. This change was due to an increase in
    exchange rate risk relating to fixed maturity securities of
    $722 million due to higher exposures primarily within the
    British pound and the Euro and to the sale of the pension
    closeout business in the U.K. Additionally, a decrease in the
    foreign exposure related to long-term debt and PABs contributed
    $66 million and $41 million, respectively, to the
    increase. This was partially offset by an increase in the
    foreign exposure related to net embedded derivatives within
    liability host contracts and the use of derivatives employed by
    the Company of $315 million and $101 million,
    respectively. The remainder of the fluctuation is attributable
    to numerous immaterial items.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the analysis of the impact of
    a 10% change (increase or decrease) in equity market rates
    determined that due to the inclusion of ALICO, a decrease of 10%
    had the most adverse effect on our equity risk while the prior
    year end’s analysis of equity market rates shows an
    increase of 10% had the most adverse effect.

Equity price risk decreased by $204 million to
    $14 million at December 31, 2010 from
    $218 million at December 31, 2009. Excluding the
    Acquisition which shifted the impact of a 10% change to a
    decrease in the equity market rates, the equity price risk has
    decreased by $191 million at December 31, 2010 from
    December 31, 2009. This decrease is primarily due to a
    change of $210 million attributed to the use of derivatives
    employed by the Company to hedge its equity exposures.
    Additionally, an increase in the net exposures related to net
    embedded derivatives within liability host contracts of
    $42 million contributed to the decrease. This was partially
    offset by a decrease of $60 million in equity securities.
    The remainder of the fluctuation is attributable to numerous
    insignificant items.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the
    three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our
    audits also included the financial statement schedules listed in
    the Index to Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and
    2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for the recognition and presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses for certain investments as required by
    accounting guidance adopted on April 1, 2009, and changed
    its method of accounting for certain assets and liabilities to a
    fair value measurement approach as required by accounting
    guidance adopted on January 1, 2008.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report, dated February 24, 2011, expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Notes

Business,
    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), its subsidiaries and affiliates.
    MetLife is a leading global provider of insurance, annuities and
    employee benefit programs throughout the United States, Japan,
    Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe and the Middle East.
    Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife offers life
    insurance, annuities, auto and homeowners insurance, mortgage
    and deposit products and other financial services to
    individuals, as well as group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries, as well as
    partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has
    control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for
    which the Company is the primary beneficiary. See
    “— Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements.” Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues
    and expenses are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular
    item. See Note 10. Intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

On November 1, 2010 (the “Acquisition Date”),
    MetLife, Inc. completed the acquisition of American Life
    Insurance Company (“American Life”) from ALICO
    Holdings LLC (“ALICO Holdings”), a subsidiary of
    American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”), and
    Delaware American Life Insurance Company (“DelAm”)
    from AIG, (American Life, together with DelAm, collectively,
    “ALICO”) (the “Acquisition”) for a total
    purchase price of $16.4 billion. The Acquisition has been
    accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which
    requires, among other things, that the consideration transferred
    be measured at fair value at the Acquisition Date and that most
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their
    estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. In addition,
    acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
    Any excess of the purchase price consideration over the assigned
    values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
    ALICO’s fiscal year-end is November 30. Accordingly,
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements reflect the
    assets and liabilities of ALICO as of November 30, 2010 and
    the operating results of ALICO from the Acquisition Date through
    November 30, 2010. See Note 2.

Certain amounts in the prior years’ consolidated financial
    statements have been reclassified to conform with the 2010
    presentation. Such reclassifications include:

•

Reclassification from other net investment gains (losses) of
    ($4,866) million and $3,910 million to net derivative
    gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively;

•

Reclassification from net change in other invested assets of
    $3,292 million and $8,168 million to cash received in
    connection with freestanding derivatives and
    ($5,393) million and ($6,454) million to cash paid in
    connection with freestanding derivatives, all within cash flows
    from investing activities, in the consolidated statements of
    cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively; and

•

Realignment that affected assets, liabilities and results of
    operations on a segment basis with no impact to the consolidated
    results. See Note 22.

See Note 23 for reclassifications related to discontinued
    operations.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.

A description of critical estimates is incorporated within the
    discussion of the related accounting policies which follows. In
    applying these policies, management makes subjective and complex
    judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that
    are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and
    related judgments are common in the insurance and financial
    services industries; others are specific to the Company’s
    businesses and operations. Actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

Fair
    Value

As described below, certain assets and liabilities are measured
    at estimated fair value on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. In addition, the notes to these consolidated
    financial statements include further disclosures of estimated
    fair values. The Company defines fair value as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
    market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants on the measurement date. In many
    cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will
    be the same at initial recognition. However, in certain cases,
    the transaction price may not represent fair value. The fair
    value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid
    to transfer a liability to a third party with the same credit
    standing. It requires that fair value be a market-based
    measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a
    hypothetical transaction at the measurement date, considered
    from the perspective of a market participant. When quoted prices
    are not used to determine fair value of an asset, the Company
    considers three broad valuation techniques: (i) the market
    approach, (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost
    approach. The Company determines the most appropriate valuation
    technique to use, given what is being measured and the
    availability of sufficient inputs. The Company prioritizes the
    inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of
    unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not
    available. The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities
    measured at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy,
    based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation
    technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
    to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability’s
    classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
    lowest level of input to its valuation. The input levels are as
    follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other significant inputs that are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

Prior to January 1, 2009, the measurement and disclosures
    of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially
    measured at estimated fair value in a business

F-10


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

combination, reporting units measured at estimated fair value in
    the first step of a goodwill impairment test and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair
    value for impairment assessment.

In addition, the Company elected the fair value option
    (“FVO”) for certain of its financial instruments to
    better match measurement of assets and liabilities in the
    consolidated statements of operations.

Investments

The accounting policies for the Company’s principal
    investments are as follows:

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

The
    Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale

and are reported at their estimated fair value.

Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are
    recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income
    (loss), net of policyholder-related amounts and deferred income
    taxes. All security transactions are recorded on a trade date
    basis. Investment gains and losses on sales of securities are
    determined on a specific identification basis.

Interest income on fixed maturity securities is recorded when
    earned using an effective yield method giving effect to
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends
    on equity securities are recorded when declared. These dividends
    and interest income are recorded in net investment income.

Included within fixed maturity securities are loan-backed
    securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
    (“ABS”). Amortization of the premium or discount from
    the purchase of these securities considers the estimated timing
    and amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual
    prepayment experience is periodically reviewed and effective
    yields are recalculated when differences arise between the
    prepayments originally anticipated and the actual prepayments
    received and currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for
    single class and multi-class mortgage-backed and ABS are
    estimated by management using inputs obtained from third-party
    specialists, including broker-dealers, and based on
    management’s knowledge of the current market. For
    credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and ABS and certain
    prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield is
    recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other
    mortgage-backed and ABS, the effective yield is recalculated on
    a retrospective basis.

The Company periodically evaluates fixed maturity and equity
    securities for impairment. The assessment of whether impairments
    have occurred is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of severity

and/or

age
    of the gross unrealized loss, as summarized in Note 3
    “— Aging of Gross Unrealized Loss and OTTI Loss
    for Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale.”

An extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed
    maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the
    issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments
    and the Company’s evaluation of recoverability of all
    contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at
    least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of
    the expected future cash flows to be collected. In contrast, for
    certain equity securities, greater weight and consideration are
    given by the Company to a decline in market value and the
    likelihood such market value decline will recover.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the
    estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost;
    (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the
    issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties;
    (iii) the

F-11


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources; (vi) with respect to fixed
    maturity securities, whether the Company has the intent to sell
    or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular
    security before the decline in estimated fair value below cost
    or amortized cost recovers; (vii) with respect to equity
    securities, whether the Company’s ability and intent to
    hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for
    the recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount equal to
    or greater than cost; (viii) unfavorable changes in
    forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and ABS; and
    (ix) other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company prospectively adopted
    guidance on the recognition and presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairment (“OTTI”) losses as described in
    “— Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements — Financial Instruments.” The
    guidance requires that an OTTI be recognized in earnings for a
    fixed maturity security in an unrealized loss position when it
    is anticipated that the amortized cost will not be recovered. In
    such situations, the OTTI recognized in earnings is the entire
    difference between the fixed maturity security’s amortized
    cost and its estimated fair value only when either: (i) the
    Company has the intent to sell the fixed maturity security; or
    (ii) it is more likely than not that the Company will be
    required to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of
    the decline in estimated fair value below amortized cost. If
    neither of these two conditions exist, the difference between
    the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security and the
    present value of projected future cash flows expected to be
    collected is recognized as an OTTI in earnings (“credit
    loss”). If the estimated fair value is less than the
    present value of projected future cash flows expected to be
    collected, this portion of OTTI related to other-than credit
    factors (“noncredit loss”) is recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss). There was no change for equity
    securities which, when an OTTI has occurred, continue to be
    impaired for the entire difference between the equity
    security’s cost and its estimated fair value with a
    corresponding charge to earnings. The Company does not make any
    adjustments for subsequent recoveries in value.

Prior to the adoption of the OTTI guidance, the Company
    recognized in earnings an OTTI for a fixed maturity security in
    an unrealized loss position unless it could assert that it had
    both the intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity security
    for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of
    estimated fair value to the security’s amortized cost.
    Also, prior to the adoption of this guidance, the entire
    difference between the fixed maturity security’s amortized
    cost basis and its estimated fair value was recognized in
    earnings if it was determined to have an OTTI.

With respect to equity securities, the Company considers in its
    OTTI analysis its intent and ability to hold a particular equity
    security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount equal to or
    greater than cost. If a sale decision is made for an equity
    security and it is not expected to recover to an amount at least
    equal to cost prior to the expected time of the sale, the
    security will be deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an
    OTTI loss will be recorded in earnings. When an OTTI loss has
    occurred, the OTTI loss is the entire difference between the
    equity security’s cost and its estimated fair value with a
    corresponding charge to earnings.

With respect to perpetual hybrid securities that have attributes
    of both debt and equity, some of which are classified as fixed
    maturity securities and some of which are classified as
    non-redeemable preferred stock within equity securities, the
    Company considers in its OTTI analysis whether there has been
    any deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of
    recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe and
    extended unrealized loss position. The Company also considers
    whether any perpetual hybrid securities, with an unrealized
    loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend
    payments. When an OTTI loss has occurred, the OTTI loss is the
    entire difference between the perpetual hybrid security’s
    cost and its estimated fair value with a corresponding charge to
    earnings.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company’s methodology and significant inputs used to
    determine the amount of the credit loss on fixed maturity
    securities under the OTTI guidance are as follows:

(i)

The Company calculates the recovery value by performing a
    discounted cash flow analysis based on the present value of
    future cash flows expected to be received. The discount rate is
    generally the effective interest rate of the fixed maturity
    security prior to impairment.

(ii)

When determining the collectability and the period over which
    value is expected to recover, the Company applies the same
    considerations utilized in its overall impairment evaluation
    process which incorporates information regarding the specific
    security, fundamentals of the industry and geographic area in
    which the security issuer operates, and overall macroeconomic
    conditions. Projected future cash flows are estimated using
    assumptions derived from management’s best estimates of
    likely scenario-based outcomes after giving consideration to a
    variety of variables that include, but are not limited to:
    general payment terms of the security; the likelihood that the
    issuer can service the scheduled interest and principal
    payments; the quality and amount of any credit enhancements; the
    security’s position within the capital structure of the
    issuer; possible corporate restructurings or asset sales by the
    issuer; and changes to the rating of the security or the issuer
    by rating agencies.

(iii)

Additional considerations are made when assessing the unique
    features that apply to certain structured securities such as
    residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”),
    commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and
    ABS. These additional factors for structured securities include,
    but are not limited to: the quality of underlying collateral;
    expected prepayment speeds; current and forecasted loss
    severity; consideration of the payment terms of the underlying
    assets backing a particular security; and the payment priority
    within the tranche structure of the security.

(iv)

When determining the amount of the credit loss for U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities, foreign government securities and
    state and political subdivision securities, management considers
    the estimated fair value as the recovery value when available
    information does not indicate that another value is more
    appropriate. When information is identified that indicates a
    recovery value other than estimated fair value, management
    considers in the determination of recovery value the same
    considerations utilized in its overall impairment evaluation
    process which incorporates available information and
    management’s best estimate of scenarios-based outcomes
    regarding the specific security and issuer; possible corporate
    restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; the quality and
    amount of any credit enhancements; the security’s position
    within the capital structure of the issuer; fundamentals of the
    industry and geographic area in which the security issuer
    operates, and the overall macroeconomic conditions.

The cost or amortized cost of fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for OTTI in the period in which the
    determination is made. These impairments are included within net
    investment gains (losses). The Company does not change the
    revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

In periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a fixed
    maturity security, the Company accounts for the impaired
    security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of
    the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium)
    based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment
    income over the remaining term of the fixed maturity security in
    a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated
    future cash flows.

The Company purchases and receives beneficial interests in
    special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio
    principally by providing equity-based returns on fixed maturity
    securities. These investments are generally made through
    structured notes and similar instruments (collectively,
    “Structured Investment Transactions”). The Company has
    not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the
    SPEs and its exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value
    of the beneficial interests in the SPEs. The Company does not
    consolidate such SPEs as it has determined it is not the primary
    beneficiary. These Structured Investment Transactions are
    included in fixed maturity

F-13


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

securities and their investment income is generally recognized
    using the retrospective interest method. Impairments of these
    investments are included in net investment gains (losses). In
    addition, the Company has invested in certain structured
    transactions that are VIEs. These structured transactions
    include reinsurance trusts, asset-backed securitizations, hybrid
    securities, real estate joint ventures, other limited
    partnership interests, and limited liability companies. The
    Company consolidates those VIEs for which it is deemed to be the
    primary beneficiary. The Company reconsiders whether it is the
    primary beneficiary for investments designated as VIEs on a
    quarterly basis.

Trading and Other Securities.

Trading and
    other securities are stated at estimated fair value. Trading and
    other securities include investments that are actively purchased
    and sold (“Actively Traded Securities”). These
    Actively Traded Securities are principally fixed maturity
    securities. Short sale agreement liabilities related to Actively
    Traded Securities, included in other liabilities, are also
    stated at estimated fair value. Trading and other securities
    also includes securities for which the FVO has been elected
    (“FVO Securities”). FVO Securities include certain
    fixed maturity and equity securities

held-for-investment

by the general account to support asset and liability matching
    strategies for certain insurance products. FVO Securities also
    include contractholder-directed investments supporting
    unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities which do not
    qualify for presentation and reporting as separate account
    summary total assets and liabilities. These investments are
    primarily mutual funds and, to a lesser extent, fixed maturity
    and equity securities, short-term investments and cash and cash
    equivalents. The investment returns on these investments inure
    to contractholders and are offset by a corresponding change in
    policyholder account balances through interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Changes in estimated fair value
    of such trading and other securities subsequent to purchase are
    included in net investment income. FVO Securities also include
    securities held by consolidated securitization entities
    (“CSEs”) (former qualifying special purpose entities
    (“QSPEs”)) with changes in estimated fair value
    subsequent to consolidation included in net investment gains
    (losses). Interest and dividends related to all trading and
    other securities are included in net investment income.

Securities Lending.

Securities loaned
    transactions, whereby blocks of securities, which are included
    in fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, are
    loaned to third parties, are treated as financing arrangements
    and the associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash
    received. At the inception of a loan, the Company obtains
    collateral, generally cash, in an amount at least equal to 102%
    of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned and
    maintains it at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the
    duration of the loan. The Company monitors the estimated fair
    value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional
    collateral obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the
    Company’s securities loaned transactions are with brokerage
    firms and commercial banks. Income and expenses associated with
    securities loaned transactions are reported as investment income
    and investment expense, respectively, within net investment
    income.

Mortgage Loans — Mortgage Loans

Held-For-Investment.

For
    the purposes of determining valuation allowances the Company
    disaggregates its mortgage loan investments into three portfolio
    segments: (1) commercial, (2) agricultural, and
    (3) residential. The accounting and valuation allowance
    policies that are applicable to all portfolio segments are
    presented below, followed by the policies applicable to both
    commercial and agricultural loans, which are very similar, as
    well as policies applicable to residential loans.

Commercial, Agricultural and Residential Mortgage
    Loans

—  Mortgage loans

held-for-investment

are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any
    unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, and
    net of valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the
    principal amount of the loan based on the loan’s
    contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums and
    discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest
    income, amortization of premiums and discounts and prepayment
    fees are reported in net investment income. Interest ceases to
    accrue when collection of interest is not considered probable

and/or

when
    interest or principal payments are past due as follows:
    commercial — 60 days; and agricultural and
    residential — 90 days, unless, in the case of a
    residential loan, it is both well-secured and in the process of
    collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status,
    uncollected

F-14


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

past due interest is charged-off against net investment income.
    Generally, the accrual of interest income resumes after all
    delinquent amounts are paid and management believes all future
    principal and interest payments will be collected. Cash receipts
    on non-accruing loans are recorded in accordance with the loan
    agreement as a reduction of principal

and/or

interest income. Charge-offs occur upon the realization of a
    credit loss, typically through foreclosure or after a decision
    is made to sell a loan, or for residential loans when, after
    considering the individual consumer’s financial status,
    management believes that uncollectability is

other-than-temporary.

Gain or loss upon charge-off is recorded, net of previously
    established valuation allowances, in net investment gains
    (losses). Cash recoveries on principal amounts previously
    charged-off are generally recorded as an increase to the
    valuation allowance, unless the valuation allowance adequately
    provides for expected credit losses; then the recovery is
    recorded in net investment gains (losses). Gains and losses from
    sales of loans and increases or decreases to valuation
    allowances are recorded in net investment gains (losses).

Mortgage loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable
    that, based upon current information and events, the Company
    will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual
    terms of the loan agreement. Specific valuation allowances are
    established using the same methodology for all three portfolio
    segments as the excess carrying value of a loan over either
    (i) the present value of expected future cash flows
    discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate,
    (ii) the estimated fair value of the loan’s underlying
    collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or
    otherwise collateral dependent, or (iii) the loan’s
    observable market price. A common evaluation framework is used
    for establishing non-specific valuation allowances for all loan
    portfolio segments; however, a separate non-specific valuation
    allowance is calculated and maintained for each loan portfolio
    segment that is based on inputs unique to each loan portfolio
    segment. Non-specific valuation allowances are established for
    pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a
    property-specific or market-specific risk has not been
    identified, but for which the Company expects to incur a credit
    loss. These evaluations are based upon several loan portfolio
    segment-specific factors, including the Company’s
    experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss
    expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. The
    Company typically uses ten years, or more, of historical
    experience, in these evaluations. These evaluations are revised
    as conditions change and new information becomes available.

Commercial and Agricultural Mortgage Loans —

All commercial and agricultural loans are monitored on an
    ongoing basis for potential credit losses. For commercial loans,
    these ongoing reviews may include an analysis of the property
    financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis,
    property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of
    the underlying collateral,

loan-to-value

ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant
    creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk
    loans, which include those that are classified as restructured,
    potentially delinquent, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as
    loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring
    process for agricultural loans is generally similar, with a
    focus on higher risk loans, including reviews on a geographic
    and property-type basis. Higher risk commercial and agricultural
    loans are reviewed individually on an ongoing basis for
    potential credit loss and specific valuation allowances are
    established using the methodology described above for all loan
    portfolio segments. Quarterly, the remaining loans are reviewed
    on a pool basis by aggregating groups of loans that have similar
    risk characteristics for potential credit loss, and non-specific
    valuation allowances are established as described above using
    inputs that are unique to each segment of the loan portfolio.

For commercial loans, the Company’s primary credit quality
    indicator is the debt service coverage ratio, which compares a
    property’s net operating income to amounts needed to
    service the principal and interest due under the loan.
    Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher
    the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The values utilized in
    calculating these ratios are developed in connection with the
    ongoing review of the commercial loan portfolio and are
    routinely updated.

F-15


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

For agricultural loans, the Company’s primary credit
    qualify indicator is the

loan-to-value

ratio.

Loan-to-value

ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair
    value of the underlying collateral. A

loan-to-value

ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is
    greater than the collateral value. A

loan-to-value

ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value
    over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the

loan-to-value

ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The
    values utilized in calculating these ratios are developed in
    connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan
    portfolio and are routinely updated.

Residential Mortgage Loans —

The Company’s
    residential loan portfolio is comprised primarily of closed end,
    amortizing residential loans and home equity lines of credit and
    it does not hold any optional adjustable rate mortgages,

sub-prime,

or low teaser rate loans.

In contrast to the commercial and agricultural loan portfolios,
    residential loans are smaller-balance homogeneous loans that are
    collectively evaluated for impairment. Non-specific valuation
    allowances are established using the evaluation framework
    described above for pools of loans with similar risk
    characteristics from inputs that are unique to the residential
    segment of the loan portfolio. Loan specific valuation
    allowances are only established on residential loans when they
    have been restructured and are established using the methodology
    described above for all loan portfolio segments.

For residential loans, the Company’s primary credit quality
    indicator is whether the loan is performing or non-performing.
    The Company generally defines non-performing residential loans
    as those that are 90 or more days past due

and/or

in
    non-accrual status. The determination of performing or
    non-performing status is assessed monthly. Generally,
    non-performing residential loans have a higher risk of
    experiencing a credit loss.

Also included in mortgage loans

held-for-investment

are commercial mortgage loans held by CSEs that were
    consolidated by the Company on January 1, 2010 upon the
    adoption of new guidance. The Company elected FVO for these
    commercial mortgage loans, and thus they are stated at estimated
    fair value with changes in estimated fair value subsequent to
    consolidation recognized in net investment gains (losses).

Mortgage Loans — Mortgage Loans

Held-For-Sale.

Mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

primarily include residential mortgage loans which are
    originated with the intent to sell and for which FVO was
    elected. These residential mortgage loans are stated at
    estimated fair value with subsequent changes in estimated fair
    value recognized in other revenue. This caption also includes
    mortgage loans previously designated as

held-for-investment

about which the Company has subsequently changed its intention.
    At the time of transfer to

held-for-sale

status, such mortgage loans are recorded at the lower of
    amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition
    costs determined on an individual loan basis. Amortized cost is
    determined in the same manner as for mortgage loans

held-for-investment

as described above. The amount by which amortized cost exceeds
    estimated fair value, less expected disposition costs, is
    recognized in net investment gains (losses).

Policy Loans.

Policy loans are stated at
    unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
    recorded as earned in net investment income using the
    contractually agreed upon interest rate. Generally, interest is
    capitalized on the policy’s anniversary date. Valuation
    allowances are not established for policy loans, as these loans
    are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the
    underlying insurance policies. Any unpaid principal or interest
    on the loan is deducted from the cash surrender value or the
    death benefit prior to settlement of the policy.

Real Estate.

Real estate

held-for-investment,

including related improvements, is stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
    (typically 20 to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.
    The Company classifies a property as

held-for-sale

if it commits to a plan to sell a property within one year and
    actively markets the property in its current condition for a
    price that is reasonable in

F-16


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

comparison to its estimated fair value. The Company classifies
    the results of operations and the gain or loss on sale of a
    property that either has been disposed of or classified as

held-for-sale

as discontinued operations, if the ongoing operations of the
    property will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company and if the Company will not have any significant
    continuing involvement in the operations of the property after
    the sale. Real estate

held-for-sale

is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair
    value less expected disposition costs. Real estate is not
    depreciated while it is classified as

held-for-sale.

The Company periodically reviews its properties

held-for-investment

for impairment and tests properties for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
    of the asset may not be recoverable and the carrying value of
    the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Properties whose
    carrying values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows
    are written down to their estimated fair value, with the
    impairment loss included in net investment gains (losses).
    Impairment losses are based upon the estimated fair value of
    real estate, which is generally computed using the present value
    of expected future cash flows from the real estate discounted at
    a rate commensurate with the underlying risks. Real estate
    acquired upon foreclosure is recorded at the lower of estimated
    fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan at the
    date of foreclosure.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests.

The Company uses the equity method of
    accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests consisting of leveraged
    buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds in
    which it has more than a minor equity interest or more than a
    minor influence over the joint ventures or partnership’s
    operations, but does not have a controlling interest and is not
    the primary beneficiary. The equity method is also used for such
    investments in which the Company has more than a minor influence
    or more than a 20% interest. Generally, the Company records its
    share of earnings using a three-month lag methodology for
    instances where the timely financial information is available
    and the contractual right exists to receive such financial
    information on a timely basis. The Company uses the cost method
    of accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests in which it has a minor
    equity investment and virtually no influence over the joint
    ventures or the partnership’s operations. The Company
    reports the distributions from real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost
    method and equity in earnings from real estate joint ventures
    and other limited partnership interests accounted for under the
    equity method in net investment income. In addition to the
    investees performing regular evaluations for the impairment of
    underlying investments, the Company routinely evaluates its
    investments in real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships for impairments. The Company considers its cost
    method investments for OTTI when the carrying value of real
    estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests
    exceeds the net asset value (“NAV”). The Company takes
    into consideration the severity and duration of this excess when
    deciding if the cost method investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired. For equity method investees, the Company considers
    financial and other information provided by the investee, other
    known information and inherent risks in the underlying
    investments, as well as future capital commitments, in
    determining whether an impairment has occurred. When an OTTI is
    deemed to have occurred, the Company records a realized capital
    loss within net investment gains (losses) to record the
    investment at its estimated fair value.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments
    include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
    less, but greater than three months, at the time of purchase and
    are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair
    value, or stated at estimated fair value, if available.

Other Invested Assets.

Other invested assets
    consist principally of freestanding derivatives with positive
    estimated fair values, leveraged leases, investments in
    insurance enterprise joint ventures, tax credit partnerships,
    funding agreements, mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)
    and funds withheld.

Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values are
    described in the derivatives accounting policy which follows.

F-17


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse debt. The
    Company participates in lease transactions which are diversified
    by industry, asset type and geographic area. The Company
    recognizes income on the leveraged leases by applying the
    leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net
    investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual
    values and impairs them to expected values.

Joint venture investments represent the Company’s
    investments in entities that engage in insurance underwriting
    activities and are accounted for under the equity method.

Tax credit partnerships are established for the purpose of
    investing in low-income housing and other social causes, where
    the primary return on investment is in the form of tax credits
    and are also accounted for under the equity method or under the
    effective yield method. The Company reports the equity in
    earnings of joint venture investments and tax credit
    partnerships in net investment income.

Funding agreements represent arrangements where the Company has
    long-term interest bearing amounts on deposit with third parties
    and are generally stated at amortized cost.

MSRs are measured at estimated fair value and are either
    acquired or are generated from the sale of originated
    residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are
    retained by the Company. Changes in estimated fair value of MSRs
    are reported in other revenues in the period in which the change
    occurs.

Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by
    ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. The
    Company records a funds withheld receivable rather than the
    underlying investments. The Company recognizes interest on funds
    withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which
    may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    underlying investments and records it in net investment income.

Investments Risks and Uncertainties.

The
    Company’s investments are exposed to four primary sources
    of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity risk, and market
    valuation. The financial statement risks, stemming from such
    investment risks, are those associated with the determination of
    estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain
    investments in times of strained market conditions, the
    recognition of impairments, the recognition of income on certain
    investments and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of
    different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to
    these financial statement risks may have a material effect on
    the amounts presented within the consolidated financial
    statements.

When available, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted prices
    in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable.
    Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company’s
    securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not
    involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include,
    but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing of the
    issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon
    rate, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity,
    estimated duration and management’s assumptions regarding
    liquidity and estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, the
    estimated fair values are based on available market information
    and management’s judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

F-18


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

is determined based on observable pricing of residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted to convert
    the securities prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market
    prices are not available. When observable pricing for similar
    loans, or securities that are backed by similar loans, are not
    available, the estimated fair values of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgage loans have also been
    designated as

held-for-sale

which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated
    fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an
    individual loan basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is
    determined using independent broker quotations or, when the loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
    estimated using internal models.

The estimated fair value of MSRs is principally determined
    through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which
    utilize various assumptions. Valuation inputs and assumptions
    include generally observable items such as type and age of loan,
    loan interest rates, current market interest rates, and certain
    unobservable inputs, including assumptions regarding estimates
    of discount rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs, all of
    which are sensitive to changing market conditions. The use of
    different valuation assumptions and inputs, as well as
    assumptions relating to the collection of expected cash flows,
    may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of MSRs.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments,
    as applicable, is described previously by investment type. The
    determination of such allowances and impairments is highly
    subjective and is based upon the Company’s periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and ABS,
    certain structured investment transactions, trading and other
    securities) is dependent upon market conditions, which could
    result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned.

The accounting guidance for the determination of when an entity
    is a VIE and when to consolidate a VIE is complex and requires
    significant management judgment. The determination of the
    VIE’s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the
    contractual and implied rights and obligations associated with
    each party’s relationship with or involvement in the
    entity, an estimate of the entity’s expected losses and
    expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates
    to each party involved in the entity. The Company generally uses
    a qualitative approach to determine whether it is the primary
    beneficiary.

For most VIEs, the entity that has both the ability to direct
    the most significant activities of the VIE and the obligation to
    absorb losses or receive benefits that could be significant to
    the VIE is considered the primary beneficiary. However, for VIEs
    that are investment companies or apply measurement principles
    consistent

    the Consolidated Financial

with those utilized by investment companies, the primary
    beneficiary is based on a risks and rewards model and is defined
    as the entity that will absorb a majority of a VIE’s
    expected losses, receive a majority of a VIE’s expected
    residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority of
    expected losses, or both. The Company reassesses its involvement
    with VIEs on a quarterly basis. The use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of
    the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
    from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit
    spreads,

and/or

other
    financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or
    contracted in the

over-the-counter

market. The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including
    swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage various
    risks relating to its ongoing business. To a lesser extent, the
    Company uses credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps,
    to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which
    are not readily available in the cash market. The Company also
    purchases certain securities, issues certain insurance policies
    and investment contracts and engages in certain reinsurance
    contracts that have embedded derivatives.

Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets either as assets within other
    invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at
    estimated fair value as determined through the use of quoted
    market prices for exchange-traded derivatives and interest rate
    forwards to sell certain to-be-announced securities or through
    the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The Company does not offset the fair value amounts recognized
    for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the
    same master netting agreement.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its
    use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting,
    changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are
    generally reported in net derivative gains (losses) except for
    those (i) in policyholder benefits and claims for economic
    hedges of variable annuity guarantees included in future policy
    benefits; (ii) in net investment income for economic hedges
    of equity method investments in joint ventures, or for all
    derivatives held in relation to the trading portfolios;
    (iii) in other revenues for derivatives held in connection
    with the Company’s mortgage banking activities; and
    (iv) in other expenses for economic hedges of foreign
    currency exposure related to the Company’s international
    subsidiaries. The fluctuations in estimated fair value of
    derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting
    can result in significant volatility in net income.

To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging
    relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management
    objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction,
    as well as its designation of the hedge as either (i) a
    hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or
    liability (“fair value hedge”); (ii) a hedge of a
    forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be
    received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
    (“cash flow hedge”); or (iii) a hedge of a net
    investment in a foreign operation. In this documentation, the
    Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to
    hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets
    forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and
    prospectively assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness
    and the method which will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A
    derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed
    as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of
    the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at
    inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated
    hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and
    measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to
    interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or
    estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in
    net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under such accounting guidance. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected.

Under a fair value hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative, including amounts measured as
    ineffectiveness, and changes in the estimated fair value of the
    hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged, are
    reported within net derivative gains (losses). The estimated
    fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any
    accruals that are separately reported in the consolidated
    statement of operations within interest income or interest
    expense to match the location of the hedged item. However,
    accruals that are not scheduled to settle until maturity are
    included in the estimated fair value of derivatives in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Under a cash flow hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative measured as effective are reported within
    other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity, and the deferred gains or losses on
    the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statement
    of operations when the Company’s earnings are affected by
    the variability in cash flows of the hedged item. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net derivative gains
    (losses). The estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives
    are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported in
    the consolidated statement of operations within interest income
    or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item.
    However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle until
    maturity are included in the estimated fair value of derivatives
    in the consolidated balance sheets.

In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes
    in the estimated fair value of the hedging derivative that are
    measured as effective are reported within other comprehensive
    income (loss) consistent with the translation adjustment for the
    hedged net investment in the foreign operation. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net derivative gains
    (losses).

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
    (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair
    value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative
    expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no
    longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will
    occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging
    instrument.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
    that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting
    changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged
    item, the derivative continues to be carried in the consolidated
    balance sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in
    estimated fair value recognized currently in net derivative
    gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized
    asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer
    adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the
    hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value
    is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged
    item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still
    probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of
    derivatives recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
    related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the
    consolidated statement of operations when the Company’s
    earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the
    hedged item.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer
    probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the
    anticipated date or within two months of that date, the
    derivative continues to be carried in the consolidated balance
    sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated
    fair value recognized currently in net derivative gains
    (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss) pursuant to the discontinued
    cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer
    probable are recognized immediately in net derivative gains
    (losses).

In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
    discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair
    value in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in its
    estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net
    derivative gains (losses).

The Company is also a party to financial instruments that
    contain terms which are deemed to be embedded derivatives. The
    Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to
    determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. If the
    instrument would not be accounted for in its entirety at
    estimated fair value and it is determined that the terms of the
    embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the
    economic characteristics of the host contract, and that a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated
    from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding
    derivative. Such embedded derivatives are carried in the
    consolidated balance sheets at estimated fair value with the
    host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are
    generally reported in net derivative gains (losses) except for
    those in policyholder benefits and claims related to ceded
    reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits
    (“GMIBs”). If the Company is unable to properly
    identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from
    its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance
    sheet at estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair
    value recognized in the current period in net investment gains
    (losses) or net investment income. Additionally, the Company may
    elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at
    estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value
    recognized in the current period in net investment gains
    (losses) or net investment income if that contract contains an
    embedded derivative that requires bifurcation.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
    with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less
    at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
    are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair
    value.

Property,
    Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer
    Software

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are
    included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, as appropriate. The estimated life for company occupied
    real estate property is generally 40 years. Estimated lives
    generally range from five to ten years for leasehold
    improvements and three to seven years for all other property and
    equipment. The cost basis of the property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements was $2.4 billion and
    $1.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Accumulated depreciation and amortization of
    property, equipment and leasehold improvements was
    $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Related depreciation and
    amortization expense was $152 million, $152 million
    and $150 million for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated
    at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software
    costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred
    to develop internal-use computer software during the application
    development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized
    generally over a four-year period using the straight-line
    method. The cost basis of computer software was
    $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
    capitalized software was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Related
    amortization expense was $189 million, $171 million
    and $153 million for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs (“DAC”) and Value of Business
    Acquired (“VOBA”)

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair
    value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type
    contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair
    value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially
    determined projections, by each block of business, of future
    policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity,
    separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses,
    investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment

F-22

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business
    may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the consolidated financial
    statements for reporting purposes.

DAC for credit, property and casualty insurance contracts, which
    is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance, accident and health or
    investment-type contracts are amortized in proportion to gross
    premiums, gross margins or gross profits, depending on the type
    of contract as described below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, traditional group life
    insurance, credit insurance, non-medical health insurance, and
    accident and health insurance) over the entire premium paying
    period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and
    expected future gross premiums. The present value of expected
    premiums is based upon the premium requirement of each policy
    and assumptions for mortality, morbidity, persistency and
    investment returns at policy issuance, or policy acquisition (as
    it relates to VOBA), that include provisions for adverse
    deviation and are consistent with the assumptions used to
    calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities. These
    assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition
    unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed to be unrecoverable
    from future expected profits. Absent a premium deficiency,
    variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition
    is caused only by variability in premium volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts within the closed
    block (dividend paying traditional contracts) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency and other factor
    changes as well as policyholder dividend scales are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that
    period. When the actual gross margins change from previously
    estimated gross margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross margins
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are
    below the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting
    period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business
    in-force, which impacts expected future gross margins. When
    expected future gross margins are below those previously
    estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase,
    resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite
    result occurs when the expected future gross margins are above
    the previously estimated expected future gross margins. Each
    period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross margins for
    each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC
    and VOBA balances.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross

F-23


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

profits change from previously estimated gross profits, the
    cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and
    adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations.
    When actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated, the
    DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current
    period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross
    profits. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the
    actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts
    expected future gross profits. When expected future gross
    profits are below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA
    amortization will increase, resulting in a current period charge
    to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the expected future
    gross profits are above the previously estimated expected future
    gross profits. Each period, the Company also reviews the
    estimated gross profits for each block of business to determine
    the recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the
    Company’s long-term expectation produce higher account
    balances, which increases the Company’s future fee
    expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations
    on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in
    higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs
    when returns are lower than the Company’s long-term
    expectation. The Company’s practice to determine the impact
    of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts
    assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not
    changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed
    when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company
    monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its
    long-term expectation changes.

The Company also periodically reviews other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Periodically, the Company modifies product benefits, features,
    rights or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for
    a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a
    contract, or by election or coverage within a contract. If such
    modification, referred to as an internal replacement,
    substantially changes the contract, the associated DAC or VOBA
    is written off immediately through income and any new deferrable
    costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred. If
    the modification does not substantially change the contract, the
    DAC or VOBA amortization on the original contract will continue
    and any acquisition costs associated with the related
    modification are expensed.

Sales
    Inducements

The Company generally has two different types of sales
    inducements which are included in other assets: (i) the
    policyholder receives a bonus whereby the policyholder’s
    initial account balance is increased by an amount equal to a
    specified percentage of the customer’s deposit; and
    (ii) the policyholder receives a higher interest rate using
    a dollar cost averaging method than would have been received
    based on the normal general account interest rate credited. The
    Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the
    life of the policy using the same methodology and assumptions
    used to amortize DAC. The amortization of sales inducements is
    included in policyholder benefits and claims. Each year, or more
    frequently if circumstances indicate a potentially significant
    recoverability issue exists, the Company reviews the deferred
    sales inducements to determine the recoverability of these
    balances.

Value of
    Distribution Agreements and Customer Relationships
    Acquired

Value of distribution agreements (“VODA”) is reported
    in other assets and represents the present value of expected
    future profits associated with the expected future business
    derived from the distribution agreements. Value of customer
    relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) is also reported in
    other assets and represents the present value of the expected
    future profits associated with the expected future business
    acquired through existing customers of the acquired company or
    business. The VODA and VOCRA associated with past acquisitions
    are amortized over useful lives ranging from 10 to 40 years
    and such amortization is included in other expenses. Each year,
    or more frequently if circumstances indicate a potentially
    significant recoverability issue exists, the Company reviews
    VODA and VOCRA to determine the recoverability of these balances.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired which represents the future economic
    benefits arising from such net assets acquired that could not be
    individually identified. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested
    for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill
    impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based
    upon data as of the close of the second quarter. Goodwill
    associated with a business acquisition is not tested for
    impairment during the year the business is acquired unless there
    is a significant identified impairment event.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, a significant portion of goodwill
    within Banking, Corporate & Other is allocated to
    reporting units within the Company’s segments.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
    there might be an indication of impairment. In such instances,
    the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a
    business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of
    goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill would be
    recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net
    income.

In performing the Company’s goodwill impairment tests, the
    estimated fair values of the reporting units are first
    determined using a market multiple approach. When further
    corroboration is required, the Company uses a discounted cash
    flow approach. For reporting units which are particularly
    sensitive to market assumptions, such as the retirement products
    and individual life reporting units, the Company may use
    additional valuation methodologies to estimate the reporting
    units’ fair values.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include
    projected earnings, current book value (with and without
    accumulated other comprehensive income), the level of economic
    capital required to support the mix of business, long-term
    growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of
    in-force business, projections of new and renewal business, as
    well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates,
    credit spreads, equity market levels and the discount rate that
    the Company believes is appropriate for the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair values of the retirement products and
    individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to
    the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company also considers
    its market capitalization in relation to the aggregate estimated
    fair value of its reporting units.

The Company applies significant judgment when determining the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units and
    when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the
    aggregate estimated fair value of its reporting units. The
    valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments
    and assumptions that are

F-25

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently
    uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable
    expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and
    the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based
    will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual
    future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s reporting units could result in goodwill
    impairments in future periods which could materially adversely
    affect the Company’s results of operations or financial
    position.

During the 2010 impairment tests of goodwill, the Company
    concluded that the fair values of all reporting units were in
    excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not
    impaired. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates potential
    triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of
    the Company’s reporting units to assess whether any
    goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating or adverse market
    conditions for certain reporting units may have a significant
    impact on the estimated fair value of these reporting units and
    could result in future impairments of goodwill.

See Note 7 for further consideration of goodwill impairment
    testing during 2010.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder Account
    Balances

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities, certain accident and health, and
    non-medical health insurance. Generally, amounts are payable
    over an extended period of time and related liabilities are
    calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to
    be paid reduced by the present value of future expected
    premiums. Such liabilities are established based on methods and
    underlying assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable
    actuarial standards. Principal assumptions used in the
    establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are
    mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement,
    disability incidence, disability terminations, investment
    returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as
    appropriate to the respective product type and geographical
    area. These assumptions are established at the time the policy
    is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the
    period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these
    assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business
    basis.

Future policy benefit liabilities for participating traditional
    life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of
    (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment
    policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture
    interest rate, ranging from 3% to 7% for domestic business and
    1% to 12% for international business, and mortality rates
    guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in
    such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal
    dividends for domestic business.

Participating business represented approximately 6% of the
    Company’s life insurance in-force at both December 31,
    2010 and 2009. Participating policies represented approximately
    26%, 28% and 27% of gross life insurance premiums for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-participating
    traditional life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate
    of the present value of expected future benefit payments and
    related expenses less the present value of expected future net
    premiums. Assumptions as to mortality and persistency are based
    upon the Company’s experience when the basis of the
    liability is established. Interest rate assumptions for the
    aggregate future policy benefit liabilities range from 3% to 8%
    for domestic business and 1% to 12% for international business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for individual and group
    traditional fixed annuities after annuitization are equal to the
    present value of expected future payments. Interest rate
    assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 2%
    to 11% for domestic business and 3% to 12% for international
    business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-medical health
    insurance, primarily related to domestic business, are
    calculated using the net level premium method and assumptions as
    to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest, which provide a
    margin for adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions used in
    establishing such liabilities range from 4% to 7%.

F-26


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest. Interest rate assumptions used in establishing such
    liabilities range from 3% to 8% for domestic business and 2% to
    9% for international business.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon
    the Company’s historical experience and other actuarial
    assumptions that consider the effects of current developments,
    anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in
    such estimated liabilities are included in the results of
    operations in the period in which the changes occur.

The Company establishes future policy benefit liabilities for
    minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain
    annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of death
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly
    evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability
    balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if
    actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier
    assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used in
    estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those used
    for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability
    and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and
    volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the
    appropriate underlying equity index, such as the
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
    Index. The benefit assumptions used in calculating the
    liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a
    range of scenarios.

•

Guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of the income
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any
    future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and
    adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge
    or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
    evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The assumptions used for estimating the GMIB liabilities are
    consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities.
    In addition, the calculation of guaranteed annuitization benefit
    liabilities incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the
    potential annuitizations that may be elected by the
    contractholder. Certain GMIBs have settlement features that
    result in a portion of that guarantee being accounted for as an
    embedded derivative and are recorded in policyholder account
    balances as described below.

Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees
    and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit
    to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence
    suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The
    assumptions used in estimating the secondary and

paid-up

guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for
    amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and
    risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility
    for variable products are consistent with historical S&P
    experience. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are
    based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.

The Company establishes policyholder account balances for
    guaranteed minimum benefits relating to certain variable annuity
    products as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”)
    guarantee the contractholder a return of their purchase payment
    via partial withdrawals, even if the account value is reduced to
    zero, provided that

F-27


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the contractholder’s cumulative withdrawals in a contract
    year do not exceed a certain limit. The initial guaranteed
    withdrawal amount is equal to the initial benefit base as
    defined in the contract (typically, the initial purchase
    payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMWB is an embedded
    derivative, which is measured at estimated fair value separately
    from the host variable annuity product.

•

Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”) and
    settlement features in certain GMIB described above provide the
    contractholder, after a specified period of time determined at
    the time of issuance of the variable annuity contract, with a
    minimum accumulation of their purchase payments even if the
    account value is reduced to zero. The initial guaranteed
    accumulation amount is equal to the initial benefit base as
    defined in the contract (typically, the initial purchase
    payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMAB is an embedded
    derivative, which is measured at estimated fair value separately
    from the host variable annuity product.

For GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB, the initial benefit base is
    increased by additional purchase payments made within a certain
    time period and decreases by benefits paid

and/or

withdrawal amounts. After a specified period of time, the
    benefit base may also increase as a result of an optional reset
    as defined in the contract.

GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB are accounted for as embedded
    derivatives with changes in estimated fair value reported in net
    derivative gains (losses).

At inception of the GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB contracts, the
    Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the
    projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the
    policyholder equal to the present value of projected future
    guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent
    “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are then
    determined based on the present value of projected future
    benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The
    projections of future benefits and future fees require capital
    market and actuarial assumptions including expectations
    concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the
    guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. The valuation of these
    embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for the
    Company’s nonperformance risk and risk margins for
    non-capital market inputs. The nonperformance adjustment is
    determined by taking into consideration publicly available
    information relating to spreads in the secondary market for the
    Holding Company’s debt, including related credit default
    swaps. These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary,
    to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims
    paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to
    the Holding Company. Risk margins are established to capture the
    non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent the
    additional compensation a market participant would require to
    assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial
    assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency, partial
    withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk margins
    requires the use of significant management judgment.

These guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than
    expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market
    conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest
    rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency
    exchange rates, changes in nonperformance risk, variations in
    actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, mortality
    and risk margins related to non-capital market inputs may result
    in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the
    guarantees that could materially affect net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees,
    and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in
    variances in profit and could result in losses. The effects of
    changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the
    results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.

Policyholder account balances relate to investment-type
    contracts, universal life-type policies and certain guaranteed
    minimum benefits. Investment-type contracts principally include
    traditional individual fixed annuities in the accumulation phase
    and non-variable group annuity contracts. Policyholder account
    balances for these contracts are equal to (i) policy
    account values, which consist of an accumulation of gross
    premium payments and investment performance; (ii) credited
    interest, ranging from 1% to 17% for domestic business and 1% to
    38% for international business, less expenses, mortality charges
    and withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating
    to business combinations.

Other
    Policy-Related Balances

Other policy-related balances include policy and contract
    claims, unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in
    advance, negative VOBA, policyholder dividends due and unpaid
    and policyholder dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims, as well as claims which have been reported
    but not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on
    the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all
    claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of
    incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development
    for each line of business. The methods used to determine these
    estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from
    this continuous review process and differences between estimates
    and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits
    and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are
    changed or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    DAC. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its
    individual life, group life and health contracts as premium
    received in advance and applies the cash received to premiums
    when due.

For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair
    value of the in-force contract obligations exceeded the book
    value of assumed in-force insurance policy liabilities,
    resulting in negative VOBA, which is presented separately from
    VOBA as an additional insurance liability. The fair value of the
    in-force contract obligations is based on actuarial determined
    projections by each block of business. Negative VOBA is
    amortized over the policy period in proportion to the
    approximate consumption of losses included in the liability
    usually expressed in terms of insurance in-force or account
    value. Such amortization is recorded as a contra-expense in
    other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Also included in other policy-related balances are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Recognition
    of Insurance Revenue and Related Benefits

Premiums related to traditional life and annuity policies with
    life contingencies and long-duration accident and health and
    credit insurance policies are recognized as revenues when due
    from policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are
    provided against such revenues to recognize profits over the
    estimated lives of the policies. When premiums are due over a
    significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits
    are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into
    operations in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or,
    for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit
    payments.

F-29


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Premiums related to short-duration non-medical health and
    disability contracts are recognized on a pro rata basis over the
    applicable contract term.

Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type
    products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues
    from such contracts consist of amounts assessed against
    policyholder account balances for mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges and are recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the
    period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged
    to operations include interest credited and benefit claims
    incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.

Premiums related to property and casualty contracts are
    recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of
    premium written relating to the unexpired coverage, are included
    in future policy benefits.

Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are
    presented net of reinsurance.

The portion of fees allocated to embedded derivatives described
    previously is recognized within net derivative gains (losses) as
    part of the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives.

Other
    Revenues

Other revenues include, in addition to items described elsewhere
    herein, advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions and fees and
    administrative service fees. Such fees and commissions are
    recognized in the period in which services are performed. Other
    revenues also include changes in account value relating to
    corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”). Under certain
    COLI contracts, if the Company reports certain unlikely adverse
    results in its consolidated financial statements, withdrawals
    would not be immediately available and would be subject to
    market value adjustment, which could result in a reduction of
    the account value.

Policyholder
    Dividends

Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance
    subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of
    policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality,
    morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as
    management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of
    statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.

Income
    Taxes

The Holding Company and its includable life insurance and
    non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”). Non-includable subsidiaries file either
    separate individual corporate tax returns or separate
    consolidated tax returns.

The Company’s accounting for income taxes represents
    management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company
    anticipates making an election under the Code Section 338
    as it relates to the Acquisition. As such, the tax basis in the
    acquired assets and liabilities is adjusted as of the
    Acquisition Date resulting in a change to the related deferred
    income taxes.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that

F-30


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Significant
    judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances
    should be established, as well as the amount of such allowances.
    When making such determination, consideration is given to, among
    other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities (see Note 15) or when
    estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred
    tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new
    information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation
    allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax
    laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or
    regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income
    tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could
    significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements in the year these changes occur.

The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit
    can be recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is
    measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
    Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties that do not
    meet the threshold are included within other liabilities and are
    charged to earnings in the period that such determination is
    made.

The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense
    and penalties recognized as a component of income tax.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties.

For each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines
    whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or
    liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with
    applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all
    contractual features, particularly those that may limit the
    amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or
    features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.

For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration
    contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the
    difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the
    liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts
    is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of
    the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is
    recorded as an adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component
    of other expenses on a basis consistent with the way the
    acquisition costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be
    recognized. Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the
    reinsurance of in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid
    (received) related to new business, are recorded as ceded
    (assumed) premiums and ceded (assumed) future policy benefit
    liabilities are established.

For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that
    meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid
    (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) unearned premiums and are reflected as a component of
    premiums and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such
    amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining
    contract period in proportion to the amount of protection
    provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration
    contracts that meet the criteria of reinsurance accounting,
    amounts paid (received) in excess of (which do not exceed) the
    related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are

F-31


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

recognized immediately as a loss. Any gains on such retroactive
    agreements are deferred and recorded in other liabilities. The
    gains are amortized primarily using the recovery method.

The assumptions used to account for both long and short-duration
    reinsurance agreements are consistent with those used for the
    underlying contracts. Ceded policyholder and contract related
    liabilities, other than those currently due, are reported gross
    on the balance sheet.

Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance agreements are
    included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables and
    amounts currently payable are included in other liabilities.
    Such assets and liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements
    with the same reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance
    sheet, if a right of offset exists within the reinsurance
    agreement. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance
    agreements, reinsurance balances recoverable could become
    uncollectible. In such instances, reinsurance recoverable
    balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible
    reinsurance.

Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include
    amounts assumed under reinsurance agreements and are net of
    reinsurance ceded. Amounts received from reinsurers for policy
    administration are reported in other revenues.

If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not
    expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits
    received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are
    included within premiums, reinsurance and other receivables. As
    amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying
    contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted.
    Interest on such deposits is recorded as other revenues or other
    expenses, as appropriate. Periodically, the Company evaluates
    the adequacy of the expected payments or recoveries and adjusts
    the deposit asset or liability through other revenues or other
    expenses, as appropriate.

Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions
    and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of
    the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty
    credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and
    anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned
    assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to
    ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial
    strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using
    criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment
    process discussed previously.

Cessions under reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the
    Company’s obligations as the primary insurer.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees
    and sales representatives. Measurement dates used for all of the
    Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans correspond with the fiscal year
    ends of sponsoring Subsidiaries, which are December 31 for
    U.S. Subsidiaries and November 30 for most foreign
    Subsidiaries.

Pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional
    formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula
    provides benefits based upon years of credited service and
    either final average or career average earnings. The cash
    balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which
    credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of
    eligible pay, as well as earnings credits, determined annually
    based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

Treasury securities, for each account balance.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Virtually all retirees, or their beneficiaries, contribute a
    portion of the total cost of postretirement medical benefits.
    Employees hired after 2003 are not eligible for any employer
    subsidy for postretirement medical benefits.

The projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit
    pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial
    assumptions, from which actual results may vary, as described
    below.

The expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) represents the actuarial present value of all
    other postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents and is used in
    measuring the periodic postretirement benefit expense. The
    accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“APBO”) represents the actuarial present value of
    future other postretirement benefits attributed to employee
    services rendered through a particular date and is the valuation
    basis upon which liabilities are established. The APBO is
    determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions, from which
    actual results may vary, as described below.

The Company recognizes the funded status of the PBO for pension
    plans and the APBO for other postretirement plans for each of
    its plans in the consolidated balance sheets. The actuarial
    gains or losses, prior service costs and credits and the
    remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not yet
    been included in net periodic benefit costs are charged, net of
    income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Net periodic benefit cost is determined using management
    estimates and actuarial assumptions to derive service cost,
    interest cost, and expected return on plan assets for a
    particular year. Net periodic benefit cost also includes the
    applicable amortization of any prior service cost (credit)
    arising from the increase (decrease) in prior years’
    benefit costs due to plan amendments or initiation of new plans.
    These costs are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over
    the expected service years of employees whose benefits are
    affected by such plan amendments. Actual experience related to
    plan assets

and/or

the
    benefit obligations may differ from that originally assumed when
    determining net periodic benefit cost for a particular period,
    resulting in gains or losses. To the extent such aggregate gains
    or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
    obligations or the market-related asset value of the plans, they
    are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the expected
    service years of employees expected to receive benefits under
    the plans.

The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firms,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

The Subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution savings and
    investment plans (“SIP”) for substantially all
    employees under which a portion of employee contributions is
    matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll
    period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    for current matching contributions. As all contributions are
    transferred currently as earned to the SIP trust, no liability
    for matching contributions is recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

As more fully described in Note 18, the Company grants
    certain employees and directors stock-based compensation awards
    under various plans that are subject to specific vesting
    conditions. The cost of all stock-based

F-33


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

transactions is measured at fair value at grant date and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. Although
    the terms of the Company’s stock-based plans do not
    accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the attainment of
    retirement eligibility, the requisite service period subsequent
    to attaining such eligibility is considered nonsubstantive.
    Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense related
    to stock-based awards over the shorter of the requisite service
    period or the period to attainment of retirement eligibility. An
    estimation of future forfeitures of stock-based awards is
    incorporated into the determination of compensation expense when
    recognizing expense over the requisite service period.

Foreign
    Currency

Assets, liabilities and operations of foreign affiliates and
    subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of
    each entity. The determination of the functional currency is
    made based on the appropriate economic and management
    indicators. With the exception of certain foreign operations,
    primarily Japan, where multiple functional currencies exist, the
    local currencies of foreign operations are the functional
    currencies. Assets and liabilities of foreign affiliates and
    subsidiaries are translated from the functional currency to
    U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at each
    year-end and income and expense accounts are translated at the
    average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. The
    resulting translation adjustments are charged or credited
    directly to other comprehensive income or loss, net of
    applicable taxes. Gains and losses from foreign currency
    transactions, including the effect of re-measurement of monetary
    assets and liabilities to the appropriate functional currency,
    are reported as part of net investment gains (losses) in the
    period in which they occur.

Discontinued
    Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company that
    either has been disposed of or is classified as

held-for-sale

are reported in discontinued operations if the operations and
    cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from
    the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the Company will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of common shares, or their equivalent,
    outstanding during the period. The difference between the number
    of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased
    represents the dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common
    share include the dilutive effect of the assumed:
    (i) exercise or issuance of stock-based awards using the
    treasury stock method; (ii) settlement of stock purchase
    contracts underlying common equity units using the treasury
    stock method; and (iii) settlement of accelerated common
    stock repurchase contracts. Under the treasury stock method,
    exercise or issuance of stock-based awards and settlement of the
    stock purchase contracts underlying common equity units is
    assumed to occur with the proceeds used to purchase common stock
    at the average market price for the period. See Notes 14,
    18 and 20.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews
    relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation,
    regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies
    to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of
    the Company’s litigation and regulatory investigations, or
    the use of different assumptions in the determination of

F-34


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

amounts recorded, could have a material effect upon the
    Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in
    particular quarterly or annual periods.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance
    laws and are generally not chargeable with liabilities that
    arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account
    assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent
    the value of such assets exceeds the separate account
    liabilities. Assets within the Company’s separate accounts
    primarily include: mutual funds, fixed maturity and equity
    securities, mortgage loans, derivatives, hedge funds, other
    limited partnership interests, short-term investments and cash
    and cash equivalents. The Company reports separately, as assets
    and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and
    liabilities of the separate accounts if (i) such separate
    accounts are legally recognized; (ii) assets supporting the
    contract liabilities are legally insulated from the
    Company’s general account liabilities;
    (iii) investments are directed by the contractholder; and
    (iv) all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder. The
    Company reports separate account assets meeting such criteria at
    their fair value which is based on the estimated fair values of
    the underlying assets comprising the portfolios of an individual
    separate account. Investment performance (including investment
    income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized
    gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to
    contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the
    same line in the consolidated statements of operations. Separate
    accounts credited with a contractual investment return are
    combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accounting for these
    investments is consistent with the methodologies described
    herein for similar financial instruments held within the general
    account. Unit-linked separate account investments which are
    directed by contractholders but do not meet one or more of the
    other above criteria are included in trading and other
    securities.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Financial
    Instruments

Effective December 31, 2010, the Company adopted new
    guidance regarding disclosures about the credit quality of
    financing receivables and valuation allowances for credit
    losses, including credit quality indicators. Such disclosures
    must be disaggregated by portfolio segment or class based on how
    a company develops its valuation allowances for credit losses
    and how it manages its credit exposure. The Company has provided
    all material required disclosures in its consolidated financial
    statements. Certain additional disclosures will be required for
    reporting periods beginning March 31, 2011 and certain
    disclosures relating to troubled debt restructurings have been
    deferred indefinitely.

Effective July 1, 2010, the Company adopted new guidance
    regarding accounting for embedded credit derivatives within
    structured securities. This guidance clarifies the type of
    embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded
    derivative bifurcation requirements. Specifically, embedded
    credit derivatives resulting only from subordination of one
    financial instrument to another continue to qualify for the
    scope exception. Embedded credit derivative features other than
    subordination must be analyzed to determine whether they require
    bifurcation and separate accounting.

As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company
    elected FVO for certain structured securities that were
    previously accounted for as fixed maturity securities. Upon
    adoption, the Company reclassified $50 million of
    securities from fixed maturity securities to trading and other
    securities. These securities had cumulative unrealized losses of
    $10 million, net of income tax, which was recognized as a
    cumulative effect adjustment to decrease

F-35


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

retained earnings with a corresponding increase to accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) as of July 1, 2010.

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new guidance
    related to financial instrument transfers and consolidation of
    VIEs. The financial instrument transfer guidance eliminates the
    concept of a QSPE, eliminates the guaranteed mortgage
    securitization exception, changes the criteria for achieving
    sale accounting when transferring a financial asset and changes
    the initial recognition of retained beneficial interests. The
    new consolidation guidance changes the definition of the primary
    beneficiary, as well as the method of determining whether an
    entity is a primary beneficiary of a VIE from a quantitative
    model to a qualitative model. Under the new qualitative model,
    the entity that has both the ability to direct the most
    significant activities of the VIE and the obligation to absorb
    losses or receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE
    is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The
    guidance requires a quarterly reassessment, as well as enhanced
    disclosures, including the effects of a company’s
    involvement with VIEs on its financial statements.

As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Company
    consolidated certain former QSPEs that were previously accounted
    for as fixed maturity CMBS and equity security collateralized
    debt obligations. The Company also elected FVO for all of the
    consolidated assets and liabilities of these entities. Upon
    consolidation, the Company recorded $278 million of
    securities classified as trading and other securities,
    $6,769 million of commercial mortgage loans and
    $6,822 million of long-term debt based on estimated fair
    values at January 1, 2010 and de-recognized
    $179 million in fixed maturity securities and less than
    $1 million in equity securities. The consolidation also
    resulted in a decrease in retained earnings of $12 million,
    net of income tax, and an increase in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) of $42 million, net of income
    tax, at January 1, 2010. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded $426 million
    of net investment income on the consolidated assets,
    $411 million of interest expense in other expenses on the
    related long-term debt, and $6 million in net investment
    gains (losses) to remeasure the assets and liabilities at their
    estimated fair values.

In addition, the Company also deconsolidated certain
    partnerships for which the Company does not have the power to
    direct activities and for which the Company has concluded it is
    no longer the primary beneficiary. These deconsolidations did
    not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained
    earnings and did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Also effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new
    guidance that indefinitely defers the above changes relating to
    the Company’s interests in entities that have all the
    attributes of an investment company or for which it is industry
    practice to apply measurement principles for financial reporting
    that are consistent with those applied by an investment company.
    As a result of the deferral, the above guidance did not apply to
    certain real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests held by the Company.

As more fully described in “Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates,”
    effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted OTTI guidance.
    This guidance amends the previously used methodology for
    determining whether an OTTI exists for fixed maturity
    securities, changes the presentation of OTTI for fixed maturity
    securities and requires additional disclosures for OTTI on fixed
    maturity and equity securities in interim and annual financial
    statements.

The Company’s net cumulative effect adjustment of adopting
    the OTTI guidance was an increase of $76 million to
    retained earnings with a corresponding increase to accumulated
    other comprehensive loss to reclassify the noncredit loss
    portion of previously recognized OTTI losses on fixed maturity
    securities held at April 1, 2009. This cumulative effect
    adjustment was comprised of an increase in the amortized cost
    basis of fixed maturity securities of $126 million, net of
    policyholder related amounts of $10 million and net of
    deferred income taxes of $40 million, resulting in the net
    cumulative effect adjustment of $76 million. The increase
    in the amortized cost basis of fixed maturity securities of
    $126 million by sector was as follows:
    $53 million — ABS, $43 million —
    RMBS, $17 million — U.S. corporate
    securities and $13 million — CMBS.

F-36

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

As a result of the adoption of the OTTI guidance, the
    Company’s pre-tax earnings for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 increased by $857 million, offset by
    an increase in other comprehensive loss representing OTTI
    relating to noncredit losses recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on
    disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging. This
    guidance requires enhanced qualitative disclosures about
    objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
    disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on
    derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk-related
    contingent features in derivative agreements. The Company has
    provided all of the material disclosures in its consolidated
    financial statements.

The following pronouncements relating to financial instruments
    had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements:

.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively an update on accounting for transfers of financial
    assets and repurchase financing transactions. This update
    provides guidance for evaluating whether to account for a
    transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing as a
    single transaction or as two separate transactions.

.

•

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted guidance
    on the recognition of interest income and impairment on
    purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that
    continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial
    assets. This new guidance more closely aligns the determination
    of whether an OTTI has occurred for a beneficial interest in a
    securitized financial asset with the original guidance for fixed
    maturity securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted guidance
    relating to application of the shortcut method of accounting for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance
    permits interest rate swaps to have a non-zero fair value at
    inception when applying the shortcut method of assessing hedge
    effectiveness as long as the difference between the transaction
    price (zero) and the fair value (exit price), as defined by
    current accounting guidance on fair value measurements, is
    solely attributable to a bid-ask spread. In addition, entities
    are not precluded from applying the shortcut method of assessing
    hedge effectiveness in a hedging relationship of interest rate
    risk involving an interest bearing asset or liability in
    situations where the hedged item is not recognized for
    accounting purposes until settlement date as long as the period
    between trade date and settlement date of the hedged item is
    consistent with generally established conventions in the
    marketplace.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted guidance
    that permits a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
    recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a
    receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a
    payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same
    master netting arrangement that have been offset. This guidance
    also includes certain terminology modifications. Upon adoption
    of this guidance, the Company did not change its accounting
    policy of not offsetting fair value amounts recognized for
    derivative instruments under master netting arrangements.

.

Business
    Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted revised
    guidance on business combinations and accounting for
    noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial
    statements. Under this guidance:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

F-37


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair
    value if the acquisition-date fair value can be reasonably
    determined. If the fair value is not estimable, an asset or
    liability is recorded if existence or incurrence at the
    acquisition date is probable and its amount is reasonably
    estimable.

•

Changes in deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and
    income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally
    affect income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

Net income (loss) includes amounts attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.

The adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Financial statements and disclosures for periods
    prior to 2009 reflect the retrospective application of the
    accounting for noncontrolling interests as required under this
    guidance.

.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively guidance on determination of the useful life of
    intangible assets. This guidance amends the factors that should
    be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions
    used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset. This change is intended to improve the consistency
    between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the
    period of expected future cash flows used to measure the fair
    value of the asset. The Company determines useful lives and
    provides all of the material disclosures prospectively on
    intangible assets acquired on or after January 1, 2009 in
    accordance with this guidance.

Fair
    Value

Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted new guidance
    that requires new disclosures about significant transfers into

and/or

out
    of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and activity
    in Level 3. In addition, this guidance provides
    clarification of existing disclosure requirements about level of
    disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques. The adoption
    of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted fair value
    measurements guidance which defines fair value, establishes a
    consistent framework for measuring fair value, establishes a
    fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used
    to measure fair value, and requires enhanced disclosures about
    fair value measurements and applied this guidance prospectively
    to assets and liabilities measured at fair value. The adoption
    of this guidance changed the valuation of certain freestanding
    derivatives by moving from a mid to bid pricing convention as it
    relates to certain volatility inputs, as well as the addition of
    liquidity adjustments and adjustments for risks inherent in a
    particular input or valuation technique. The adoption of this
    guidance also changed the valuation of the Company’s
    embedded derivatives, most significantly the valuation of
    embedded derivatives associated with certain guarantees on
    variable annuity contracts. The change in valuation of embedded
    derivatives associated with guarantees on annuity contracts
    resulted from the incorporation of risk margins associated with
    non-capital market inputs and the inclusion of the
    Company’s nonperformance risk in their valuation. At
    January 1, 2008, the impact of

F-38

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

adopting the guidance on assets and liabilities measured at
    estimated fair value was $30 million ($19 million, net
    of income tax) and was recognized as a change in estimate in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations where it was
    presented in the respective statement of operations caption to
    which the item measured at estimated fair value is presented.
    There were no significant changes in estimated fair value of
    items measured at fair value and reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). The addition of risk margins and
    the Company’s nonperformance risk adjustment in the
    valuation of embedded derivatives associated with annuity
    contracts may result in significant volatility in the
    Company’s consolidated net income in future periods. The
    Company provided all of the material disclosures in Note 5.

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued guidance related to the FVO for
    financial assets and financial liabilities. This guidance
    permits entities the option to measure most financial
    instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified
    election dates and to recognize related unrealized gains and
    losses in earnings. The FVO is applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis upon adoption of the standard, upon the acquisition of an
    eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment
    or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair
    value election is an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company elected FVO on fixed maturity
    and equity securities backing certain pension products sold in
    Brazil. Such securities are presented as trading and other
    securities in the consolidated balance sheets with subsequent
    changes in estimated fair value recognized in net investment
    income. Previously, these securities were accounted for as

available-for-sale

securities and unrealized gains and losses on these securities
    were recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s insurance joint
    venture in Japan also elected FVO for certain of its existing
    single premium deferred annuities and the assets supporting such
    liabilities. FVO was elected to achieve improved reporting of
    the asset/liability matching associated with these products.
    Adoption of this guidance by the Company and its Japanese joint
    venture resulted in an increase in retained earnings of
    $27 million, net of income tax, at January 1, 2008.
    The election of FVO resulted in the reclassification of
    $10 million, net of income tax, of net unrealized gains
    from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to retained
    earnings on January 1, 2008.

The following pronouncements relating to fair value had no
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements:

•

Effective September 30, 2008, the Company adopted guidance
    relating to the fair value measurements of financial assets when
    the market for those assets is not active. It provides guidance
    on how a company’s internal cash flow and discount rate
    assumptions should be considered in the measurement of fair
    value when relevant market data does not exist, how observable
    market information in an inactive market affects fair value
    measurement and how the use of market quotes should be
    considered when assessing the relevance of observable and
    unobservable data available to measure fair value.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented fair
    value measurements guidance for certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis. This guidance applies to such items as:
    (i) nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at estimated fair value in a business
    combination; (ii) reporting units measured at estimated
    fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test; and
    (iii) indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at
    estimated fair value for impairment assessment.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively guidance on issuer’s accounting for
    liabilities measured at fair value with a third-party credit
    enhancement. This guidance states that an issuer of a liability
    with a third-party credit enhancement should not include the
    effect of the credit enhancement in the fair value measurement
    of the liability. In addition, it requires disclosures about the
    existence of any third-party credit enhancement related to
    liabilities that are measured at fair value.

.

•

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on:
    (i) estimating the fair value of an asset or liability if
    there was a significant decrease in the volume and level of
    trading activity for these assets or

F-39

    Statements — (Continued)

liabilities; and (ii) identifying transactions that are not
    orderly. The Company has provided all of the material
    disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

.

•

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted guidance
    on: (i) measuring the fair value of investments in certain
    entities that calculate NAV per share; (ii) how investments
    within its scope would be classified in the fair value
    hierarchy; and (iii) enhanced disclosure requirements, for
    both interim and annual periods, about the nature and risks of
    investments measured at fair value on a recurring or
    non-recurring basis.

.

•

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted guidance
    on measuring liabilities at fair value. This guidance provides
    clarification for measuring fair value in circumstances in which
    a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability
    is not available. In such circumstances a company is required to
    measure fair value using either a valuation technique that uses:
    (i) the quoted price of the identical liability when traded
    as an asset; or (ii) quoted prices for similar liabilities
    or similar liabilities when traded as assets; or
    (iii) another valuation technique that is consistent with
    the principles of fair value measurement such as an income
    approach (e.g., present value technique) or a market approach
    (e.g., “entry” value technique).

.

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted guidance
    to enhance the transparency surrounding the types of assets and
    associated risks in an employer’s defined benefit pension
    or other postretirement benefit plans. This guidance requires an
    employer to disclose information about the valuation of plan
    assets similar to that required under other fair value
    disclosure guidance. The Company provided all of the material
    disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

.

Other
    Pronouncements

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted prospectively
    guidance which establishes general standards for accounting and
    disclosures of events that occur subsequent to the balance sheet
    date but before financial statements are issued or available to
    be issued. The Company has provided all of the material
    disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

The following pronouncements had no material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements:

.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on
    determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is
    indexed to an entity’s own stock. This guidance provides a
    framework for evaluating the terms of a particular instrument
    and whether such terms qualify the instrument as being indexed
    to an entity’s own stock.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted guidance on
    written loan commitments recorded at fair value through
    earnings. It provides guidance on (i) incorporating
    expected net future cash flows when related to the associated
    servicing of a loan when measuring fair value; and
    (ii) broadening the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) staff’s view that
    internally-developed intangible assets should not be recorded as
    part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment or to
    written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value
    through earnings. Internally-developed intangible assets are not
    considered a component of the related instruments.

.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company prospectively
    adopted guidance on the sale of real estate when the agreement
    includes a buy-sell clause. This guidance addresses whether the
    existence of a buy-sell arrangement would preclude partial sales
    treatment when real estate is sold to a jointly owned entity and
    concludes that the existence of a buy-sell clause does not
    necessarily preclude partial sale treatment under current
    guidance.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2010, the FASB issued new guidance addressing when a
    business combination should be assumed to have occurred for the
    purpose of providing pro forma disclosure (Accounting Standards
    Update (“ASU”)

2010-29,

Business Combinations (Topic 805): Disclosure of
    Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business
    Combinations

). Under the new guidance, if an entity presents
    comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose
    revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the
    business combination that occurred during the current year had
    occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual
    reporting period. The guidance also expands the supplemental pro
    forma disclosures to include additional narratives. The guidance
    is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2010. The Company will apply the guidance
    prospectively on its accounting for future acquisitions and does
    not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued new guidance regarding
    goodwill impairment testing (ASU

2010-28,

Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): When
    to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting
    Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts

). This guidance
    modifies Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting
    units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those
    reporting units, an entity would be required to perform Step 2
    of the test if qualitative factors indicate that it is more
    likely than not that goodwill impairment exists. The guidance is
    effective for the first quarter of 2011. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material
    impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2010, the FASB issued new guidance regarding
    accounting for deferred acquisition costs

(ASU 2010-26,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing
    Insurance Contracts

) effective for the first quarter of
    2012. This guidance clarifies the costs that should be deferred
    by insurance entities when issuing and renewing insurance
    contracts. The guidance also specifies that only costs related
    directly to successful acquisition of new or renewal contracts
    can be capitalized. All other acquisition-related costs should
    be expensed as incurred. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2010, the FASB issued new guidance regarding accounting
    for investment funds determined to be VIEs (ASU

2010-15,

How Investments Held through Separate Accounts Affect an
    Insurer’s Consolidation Analysis of Those Investments

).
    Under this guidance, an insurance entity would not be required
    to consolidate a voting-interest investment fund when it holds
    the majority of the voting interests of the fund through its
    separate accounts. In addition, an insurance entity would not
    consider the interests held through separate accounts for the
    benefit of policyholders in the insurer’s evaluation of its
    economics in a VIE, unless the separate account contractholder
    is a related party. The guidance is effective for the first
    quarter of 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of
    this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated
    financial statements.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

    Acquisition of ALICO

Description
    of Transaction

On the Acquisition Date, MetLife, Inc. acquired all of the
    issued and outstanding capital stock of American Life from ALICO
    Holdings, a subsidiary of AIG, and DelAm from AIG for a total
    purchase price of $16.4 billion, which consisted of
    (i) cash of $7.2 billion (includes settlement of
    intercompany balances and certain other adjustments), and
    (ii) securities of MetLife, Inc. valued at
    $9.2 billion.

The $7.2 billion cash portion of the purchase price was
    funded through the issuance of common stock as described in
    Note 18, fixed and floating rate senior debt as described
    in Note 11 as well as cash on hand. The securities issued
    to ALICO Holdings included (a) 78,239,712 shares of
    MetLife, Inc.’s common stock;
    (b) 6,857,000 shares of Series B Contingent
    Convertible Junior Participating Non-Cumulative Perpetual
    Preferred Stock (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”) of
    MetLife, Inc.; and (c) 40 million common equity units

F-41


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

of MetLife, Inc. (the “Equity Units”) with an
    aggregate stated amount at issuance of $3.0 billion,
    initially consisting of (i) three purchase contracts (the
    “Series C Purchase Contracts,” the
    “Series D Purchase Contracts” and the
    “Series E Purchase Contracts” and, together, the
    “Purchase Contracts”), obligating the holder to
    purchase, on specified future settlement dates, a variable
    number of shares of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock for a
    fixed price; and (ii) an interest in each of three series
    of debt securities (the “Series C Debt
    Securities,” the “Series D Debt Securities”
    and the “Series E Debt Securities,” and,
    together, the “Debt Securities”) issued by MetLife,
    Inc. Distributions on the Equity Units will be made quarterly,
    through contract payments on the Purchase Contracts and interest
    payments on the Debt Securities, initially at an aggregate
    annual rate of 5.00% (an average annual rate of 3.02% on the
    Purchase Contracts and an average annual rate of 1.98% on the
    Debt Securities) as described in Note 14.

ALICO is an international life insurance company, providing
    consumers and businesses with products and services for life
    insurance, accident and health insurance, retirement and wealth
    management solutions in 54 countries. The Acquisition will
    significantly broaden the Company’s diversification by
    product, distribution and geography, meaningfully accelerate
    MetLife’s global growth strategy, and create the
    opportunity to build an international franchise leveraging the
    key strengths of ALICO. ALICO’s largest international
    market is Japan. As of December 31, 2010, the Japan
    operation’s total assets represented approximately 12% of
    the Company’s total assets.

The aggregate amount of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock to be
    issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the transaction is
    expected to be between 214.6 million to 231.5 million
    shares, consisting of 78.2 million shares issued at
    closing, 68.6 million shares to be issued upon conversion
    of the Convertible Preferred Stock and between 67.8 million
    and 84.7 million shares of common stock, in total, issuable
    upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts forming part of the
    Equity Units. See Note 14. The ownership of the shares
    issued to ALICO Holdings is subject to an investor rights
    agreement, which grants to ALICO Holdings certain rights and
    sets forth certain agreements with respect to ALICO
    Holdings’ ownership of, voting on and transfer of the
    shares, including minimum holding periods and restrictions on
    the number of shares ALICO Holdings can sell at one time.

Goodwill

Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration
    transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the
    future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed that could not be individually identified.
    The goodwill recorded as part of the Acquisition includes the
    expected synergies and other benefits that management believes
    will result from combining the operations of ALICO with the
    operations of MetLife, including further diversification in
    geographic mix and product offerings and an increase in
    distribution strength.

Of the $7.0 billion of goodwill, approximately
    $4.0 billion is estimated to be deductible for tax
    purposes. Of the $4.0 billion, approximately
    $573 million is estimated to be deductible for
    U.S. tax purposes prior to the completion of the
    anticipated restructuring of American Life’s foreign
    branches. See “—Branch Restructuring”. The
    goodwill resulting from the Acquisition was presented within the
    Company’s International segment.

Identified
    Intangibles

VOBA reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts
    acquired and represents the portion of the purchase price that
    is allocated to the value of future profits embedded in acquired
    insurance annuity and investment-type contracts in-force at the
    Acquisition Date.

The value of VODA and VOCRA, included in other assets, reflects
    the estimated fair value of ALICO’s distribution agreements
    and customer relationships acquired at November 1, 2010 and
    will be amortized over the useful lives. Each year the Company
    will review VODA and VOCRA to determine the recoverability of
    these balances.

The use of discount rates was necessary to establish the fair
    value of VOBA and the identifiable intangibles. In selecting the
    appropriate discount rates, management considered its weighted
    average cost of capital, as well as the weighted average cost of
    capital required by market participants. The fair value of
    acquired liabilities was determined using risk free rates
    adjusted for a nonperformance risk premium. The nonperformance
    adjustment was determined by taking into consideration publicly
    available information relating to spreads in the secondary
    market for the Holding Company’s debt, including related
    credit default swaps. These observable spreads were then
    adjusted to reflect the priority of these liabilities, the
    claims paying ability of the insurance subsidiaries compared to
    the Holding Company and, as necessary, the relative credit
    spreads of the liabilities’ currencies of denomination as
    compared to USD spreads.

The fair values of business acquired, distribution agreements
    and customer relationships and the weighted average amortization
    periods are as follows as of November 1, 2010:

The estimated future amortization expense allocated to other
    expenses for the next five years for VOBA, VODA and VOCRA is
    $1,312 million in 2011, $1,076 million in 2012,
    $884 million in 2013, $759 million in 2014 and
    $653 million in 2015.

For certain acquired blocks of business, the estimated fair
    value of acquired liabilities exceeded the initial policy
    reserves assumed at November 1, 2010, resulting in a
    negative VOBA of $4.4 billion recorded at the Acquisition
    Date. Negative VOBA is recorded in other policy-related
    balances. The fair value of the in-force contract obligations
    was based on actuarially determined projections for each block
    of business. Negative VOBA is amortized over the policy period
    in proportion to premiums or the approximate consumption of
    losses included in the liability usually expressed in terms of
    insurance in-force or account value. Such amortization is
    recorded as a contra-expense in other expenses.

Trademark
    Assets

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company recognized
    $47 million in trademark assets recorded in other assets.
    The fair value of the trademark assets will be recognized
    ratably over their expected useful lives which is generally
    between five to ten years.

Indemnification
    Assets and Contingent Consideration

The stock purchase agreement dated as of March 7, 2010, as
    amended by and among MetLife, Inc., AIG and ALICO Holdings (the
    “Stock Purchase Agreement”) and related agreements
    include indemnification provisions that allocate the risk of
    losses arising out of contingencies or other uncertainties that
    existed as of the Acquisition Date in accordance with the terms,
    and subject to the limitations and procedures, provided by such
    provisions. As applicable, the Company recognizes an
    indemnification asset at the same time that it recognizes the
    indemnified item, measured on the same basis as the indemnified
    item. The Company recognized the following indemnification
    assets and contingencies as of the Acquisition Date in
    accordance with the indemnification provisions of the Stock
    Purchase Agreement and related agreements:

Investments

— The Company established
    indemnification assets for the fair value of amounts expected to
    be recovered from defaults of certain fixed maturity securities,
    CMBS and mortgage loans. These indemnification assets are
    included in other invested assets at December 31, 2010.

Litigation

— The Company established
    indemnification assets associated with certain settlements
    expected to be made in connection with the suspension of
    withdrawals from certain unit-linked funds offered to certain
    policyholders. These indemnification assets are included in
    other assets at December 31, 2010.

Section 338 Elections

— MetLife, Inc. and
    American Life will be fully indemnified by ALICO Holdings for
    all taxes and any interest and penalties resulting from
    anticipated elections to be made with respect to American Life
    and its subsidiaries under Section 338(h)(10) and
    Section 338(g) of the Code. This indemnification asset is
    included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables at
    December 31, 2010.

The Company recognized an aggregate amount of $574 million
    for indemnification assets as of the Acquisition Date in
    accordance with the indemnification provisions of the Stock
    Purchase Agreement and related agreements.

Contingent Consideration

— American Life has
    guaranteed that the fair value of a fund of assets backing
    certain U.K. unit-linked contracts will have a value of at least
    £1 per unit on July 1, 2012. In accordance with the
    provisions of the Stock Purchase Agreement if the shortfall
    between the aggregate guaranteed amount and the fair value of
    the fund exceeds £106 million AIG will pay the
    difference to American Life and conversely, if the shortfall at
    July 1, 2012 is less than £106 million ALICO will
    pay the difference to AIG. The Company believes that the fair
    value of the fund will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount by
    July 1, 2012. Therefore, the Company recognized a
    contingent consideration liability in the amount of
    $88 million as of the Acquisition Date which was included
    as additional purchase consideration in determining the amount
    paid for ALICO.

Indemnification
    Collateral

ALICO Holdings may satisfy certain of its indemnification and
    other payment obligations by delivering cash, shares of stock or
    Equity Units issued by MetLife, Inc. in connection with the
    Acquisition. The Equity Units were deposited into an
    indemnification collateral account on the Acquisition Date as
    security for these obligations. This collateral will be released
    periodically over a

30-month

period on each of the

12-month,

24-month

and

30-month

anniversaries of the Acquisition Date as follows: Equity Units
    with an aggregate stated amount of $1.0 billion (or such
    amount of net cash proceeds from the sale of Equity Units or
    other eligible collateral equal to such stated amount), less, on
    each such release date, specified reserve amounts, including,
    but not limited to, amounts

F-45


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

necessary to satisfy then outstanding indemnification claims
    made by MetLife, Inc. However, if an AIG bankruptcy event
    occurs, any then remaining indemnification collateral will
    remain in the indemnification collateral account and will be
    released in part on each of the

30-month,

36-month

and

48-month

anniversaries of the Acquisition Date, less, on each such
    release date, any such specified reserved amounts.

Branch
    Restructuring

On March 4, 2010, American Life entered into a closing
    agreement (the “Closing Agreement”) with the
    Commissioner of the IRS with respect to a U.S. withholding
    tax issue arising as a result of payments made by its foreign
    branches. The Closing Agreement provides that American
    Life’s foreign branches will not be required to withhold
    U.S. income tax on the income portion of payments made
    pursuant to American Life’s life insurance and annuity
    contracts (“Covered Payments”) for any tax periods
    beginning on January 1, 2005 and ending on
    December 31, 2013 (the “Deferral Period”). The
    Closing Agreement requires that American Life submit a plan to
    the IRS within 90 days after the close of the Acquisition,
    indicating the steps American Life will take (on a country by
    country basis) to ensure that no substantial amount of
    U.S. withholding tax will arise from Covered Payments made
    by American Life’s foreign branches to foreign customers
    after the Deferral Period. Such plan, which was submitted to the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on January 29,
    2011, involves the transfer of businesses from certain of the
    foreign branches of American Life to one or more existing or
    newly-formed subsidiaries of MetLife, Inc. or American Life.

A liability of $277 million was recognized in purchase
    accounting as of November 1, 2010, for the anticipated and
    estimated costs associated with restructuring American
    Life’s foreign branches into subsidiaries in connection
    with the Closing Agreement.

Current
    and Deferred Income Tax

The future tax effects of temporary differences between
    financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are
    measured at the balance sheet dates and are recorded as deferred
    income tax assets and liabilities, with certain exceptions such
    as certain temporary differences relating to goodwill under
    purchase accounting.

For federal income tax purposes, MetLife, Inc. and ALICO
    Holdings are expected to make Section 338 elections with
    respect to American Life and certain of its subsidiaries. In
    addition, MetLife, Inc. and AIG are expected to make a
    Section 338 election with respect to DelAm. Under such
    elections, the U.S. tax basis of the assets deemed acquired
    and liabilities assumed of ALICO were adjusted as of the
    Acquisition Date to reflect the consequences of the
    Section 338 elections.

The reversal of temporary differences (between financial
    reporting and U.S. tax bases of assets and liabilities) of
    American Life’s foreign branches, post-branch
    restructuring, in connection with the Closing Agreement (i.e.,
    generally, after the end of the Deferral Period) is not expected
    to result in any direct U.S. tax effect. Thus, as of
    November 1, 2010, American Life reduced its net deferred
    tax asset of $425 million by $671 million that
    reflects the amount of U.S. deferred tax asset that is expected
    to reverse post-branch restructuring. Therefore, American Life
    recognized a U.S. net deferred tax liability of
    approximately $246 million in purchase accounting.

As of the Acquisition Date, ALICO’s current and deferred
    income tax liabilities are provisional and not yet finalized.
    Current income taxes may be adjusted pending the resolution of
    the tax value of MetLife, Inc. securities delivered to ALICO
    Holdings as part of the purchase consideration on the
    Acquisition Date, the amount of taxes resulting from the
    Section 338 elections and the filing of income tax returns.
    Deferred income taxes may be adjusted as a result of changes in
    estimates and assumptions relating to the reversal of
    U.S. temporary differences prior to the completion of the
    anticipated restructuring of American Life’s foreign
    branches, the filing of income tax returns and as additional
    information becomes available during the measurement period. We
    expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no
    later than one year from the Acquisition Date.

The pro forma information was derived from the historical
    financial information of MetLife and ALICO, reflecting the
    results of operations of MetLife and ALICO for 2010 and 2009.
    The historical financial information has been adjusted to give
    effect to the pro forma events that are directly attributable to
    the Acquisition and factually supportable and expected to have a
    continuing impact on the combined results. Discontinued
    operations and the related earnings per share have been excluded
    from the presentation as they are non-recurring in nature. The
    pro forma information is not intended to reflect the results of
    operations of the combined company that would have resulted had
    the Acquisition been effective during the periods presented or
    the results that may be obtained by the combined company in the
    future. The pro forma information does not reflect future events
    that may occur after the Acquisition, including, but not limited
    to, expense efficiencies or revenue enhancements arising from
    the Acquisition and also does not give effect to certain
    one-time charges that MetLife expects to incur such as
    restructuring and integration costs.

The pro forma information primarily reflects the following pro
    forma adjustments:

•

reduction in net investment income to reflect the amortization
    or accretion associated with the new cost basis of the acquired
    fixed maturities

available-for-sale

portfolio;

•

elimination of amortization associated with the elimination of
    ALICO’s historical DAC;

•

amortization of VOBA, VODA and VOCRA associated with the
    establishment of VOBA, VODA and VOCRA arising from the
    Acquisition;

•

reduction in other expenses associated with the amortization of
    negative VOBA;

•

reduction in revenues associated with the elimination of
    ALICO’s historical unearned revenue liability;

•

interest expense associated with the issuance of the Debt
    Securities to ALICO Holdings and the public issuance of senior
    notes in connection with the financing of the Acquisition;

•

certain adjustments to conform to MetLife’s accounting
    policies; and

•

reversal of investment and derivative gains (losses) associated
    with certain transactions that were completed prior to the
    Acquisition Date (conditions of closing).

Costs
    Related to Acquisition

Transaction and Integration-Related
    Expenses.

The Company incurred $100 million
    of transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Transaction costs represent costs directly related to effecting
    the Acquisition and primarily include banking and legal
    expenses. Such costs have been expensed as incurred and are
    included in other expenses. These expenses have been reported
    within Banking, Corporate & Other.

Integration-related expenses incurred for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and included in other expenses were
    $176 million. Integration costs represent incremental costs
    directly related to integrating ALICO, including expenses for
    consulting, rebranding and the integration of information
    systems. As the integration of ALICO is an enterprise-wide
    initiative, these expenses have been reported within Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

Restructuring Costs and Other Charges.

As part
    of the integration of ALICO’s operations, management has
    initiated restructuring plans focused on increasing productivity
    and improving the efficiency of the Company’s operations.
    For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recognized a severance-related restructuring charge of
    $4 million associated with the termination of certain
    employees in connection with this initiative which were
    reflected within other expenses. The Company did not make any
    cash payments related to these severance costs as of
    December 31, 2010.

Estimated restructuring costs may change as management continues
    to execute its restructuring plans. Management anticipates
    further restructuring charges including severance, contract
    termination costs and other associated costs through the year
    ended December 31, 2011. However, such restructuring plans
    are not sufficiently developed to enable the Company to make an
    estimate of such restructuring charges at December 31, 2010.

    Pending Disposition

In October 2010, the Company and its joint venture partner,
    MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc.
    (“MS&AD”), reached an agreement under which the
    Company intends to sell its 50% interest in Mitsui Sumitomo
    MetLife Insurance Co., Ltd. (“MSI MetLife”), a Japan
    domiciled life insurance company, to MS&AD for
    approximately $275 million
    (

¥

22.5 billion). During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, the Company recorded an investment loss
    of $136 million, net of income tax, to record its
    investment in MSI MetLife at its estimated recoverable amount.
    It is anticipated that the sale will close on or about
    April 1, 2011, subject to customary closing conditions,
    including obtaining required regulatory approvals.

    Disposition

In March 2009, the Company sold Cova Corporation
    (“Cova”), the parent company of Texas Life Insurance
    Company (“Texas Life”) to a third-party for
    $130 million in cash consideration, excluding
    $1 million of transaction costs. The net assets sold were
    $101 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of
    $28 million, net of income tax. The Company also
    reclassified $4 million, net of income tax, of the 2009
    operations of Texas Life into discontinued operations in the
    consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company
    recognized income from discontinued operations of
    $32 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. See Note 23.

    Disposition through Assumption Reinsurance

On October 30, 2009, the Company completed the disposal,
    through assumption reinsurance, of substantially all of the
    insurance business of MetLife Canada, a wholly-owned indirect
    subsidiary, to a third-party. Pursuant to the assumption
    reinsurance agreement, the consideration paid by the Company was
    $259 million, comprised of cash of $14 million and
    fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans and other assets
    totaling $245 million. At the date of the assumption
    reinsurance agreement, the carrying value of insurance
    liabilities transferred was $267 million, resulting in a
    gain of $5 million, net of income tax. The gain was
    recognized in net investment gains (losses).

    Acquisitions and Disposition

During 2008, the Company made five acquisitions for
    $783 million. As a result of these acquisitions,
    MetLife’s Insurance Products segment increased its product
    offering of dental and vision benefit plans, MetLife Bank,
    National Association (“MetLife Bank”) within Banking,
    Corporate & Other entered the mortgage origination and
    servicing business and the International segment increased its
    presence in Mexico and Brazil. The acquisitions were each
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and,
    accordingly, commenced being included in the operating results
    of the Company upon their respective closing dates. Total
    consideration paid by the Company for these acquisitions
    consisted of $763 million in cash and $20 million in
    transaction costs. The net fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed totaled $527 million, resulting in
    goodwill of $256 million. Goodwill increased by
    $122 million, $73 million and $61 million in the
    International segment, Insurance Products segment and Banking,
    Corporate & Other, respectively. The goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes. VOCRA, VOBA and other intangibles
    increased by $137 million, $7 million and
    $6 million, respectively, as a result of these
    acquisitions. Further information on VOBA, goodwill and VOCRA is
    provided in Notes 6, 7 and 8, respectively.

In September 2008, the Company completed a tax-free split-off of
    its majority-owned subsidiary, Reinsurance Group of America,
    Incorporated (“RGA”). The Company and RGA entered into
    a recapitalization and distribution agreement, pursuant to which
    the Company agreed to divest substantially all of its 52%
    interest in RGA to the Company’s stockholders. The
    split-off was effected through the following:

•

A recapitalization of RGA common stock into two classes of
    common stock — RGA Class A common stock and RGA
    Class B common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
    recapitalization, each outstanding share of RGA common stock,
    including the 32,243,539 shares of RGA common stock
    beneficially owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, was
    reclassified as one share of RGA Class A common stock.
    Immediately thereafter, the Company and its subsidiaries
    exchanged 29,243,539 shares of its RGA Class A common
    stock — which represented all of the RGA Class A
    common stock beneficially owned by the Company and its
    subsidiaries other than 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock — with RGA for
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock.

•

An exchange offer, pursuant to which the Company offered to
    acquire MetLife common stock from its stockholders in exchange
    for all of its 29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common
    stock. The exchange ratio was determined based upon a ratio of
    the value of the MetLife and RGA shares during the

three-day

period prior to the closing of the exchange offer. The
    3,000,000 shares of the RGA Class A common stock were
    not subject to the tax-free exchange.

As a result of completion of the recapitalization and exchange
    offer, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock with a market value of $1,318 million and, in
    exchange, delivered 29,243,539 shares of RGA’s
    Class B common stock with a net book value of
    $1,716 million. The resulting loss on disposition,
    inclusive of transaction costs of $60 million, was
    $458 million. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company
    incurred $2 million, net of income tax, of additional costs
    related to this split-off. The 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock retained by the Company are marketable
    equity securities which do not constitute significant continuing
    involvement in the operations of RGA; accordingly, they were
    classified within equity securities in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company at a cost basis of

F-49


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$157 million which is equivalent to the net book value of
    the shares. The equity securities have been recorded at fair
    value at each subsequent reporting date. The Company agreed to
    dispose of the remaining shares of RGA within the next five
    years. In connection with the Company’s agreement to
    dispose of the remaining shares, the Company also recognized, in
    its provision for income tax on continuing operations, a
    deferred tax liability of $16 million which represents the
    difference between the book and taxable basis of the remaining
    investment in RGA. On February 15, 2011, the Company sold to RGA
    such remaining shares. The impact of the disposition of the
    Company’s investment in RGA was reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements as discontinued
    operations. See Note 23.

The Company’s holdings in redeemable preferred stock with
    stated maturity dates, commonly referred to as “capital
    securities”, were primarily issued by U.S. financial
    institutions and have cumulative interest deferral features. The
    Company held $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion at
    estimated fair value of such securities at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, which are included in the U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities sectors within fixed maturity
    securities.

(4)

Equity securities primarily consist of investments in common and
    preferred stocks, including certain perpetual hybrid securities
    and mutual fund interests. Privately-held equity securities were
    $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion at estimated fair value
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company held foreign currency derivatives with notional

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — Summary.

The following
    section contains a summary of the concentrations of credit risk
    related to fixed maturity securities holdings.

The Company was not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk
    of any single issuer greater than 10% of the Company’s
    equity, other than the government securities summarized in the

    holdings in sovereign fixed maturity securities of Portugal,
    Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, commonly referred to as
    “Europe’s perimeter region,” was
    $1,562 million and $6 million prior to, and was
    $1,392 million and $6 million, after considering net
    purchased credit default swap protection at December 31,

    these Europe perimeter region sovereign fixed maturity
    securities was 2.8% of the Company’s equity and 0.3% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2010.

Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are a type of
    asset-backed security that is secured by a mortgage or
    collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage payments from
    homeowners pass from the originating bank through an
    intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank,
    which collects the payments, and for a fee, remits or passes
    these payments through to the holders of the pass-through
    securities. Collateralized mortgage obligations are a type of
    mortgage-backed security structured by dividing the cash flows
    of mortgages into separate pools or tranches of risk that create
    multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority
    of payments.

Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of
    residential mortgage loans to the most creditworthy borrowers
    with high quality credit profiles. Alternative residential
    mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) are a classification of
    mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls
    between prime and

sub-prime.

Sub-prime

mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage
    loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. Included within
    Alt-A RMBS are resecuritization of real estate mortgage
    investment conduit (“Re-REMIC”) securities. Re-REMIC
    Alt-A RMBS involve the pooling of previous issues of Alt-A RMBS
    and restructuring the combined pools to create new senior and
    subordinated securities. The credit enhancement on the senior
    tranches is improved through the resecuritization. The
    Company’s holdings are in senior tranches with significant
    credit enhancement.

    and $1,044 million and unrealized losses of
    $317 million and $593 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Approximately 54% of this portfolio
    was rated Aa or better, of which 88% was in vintage year 2005
    and prior at December 31, 2010. Approximately 61% of this
    portfolio was rated Aa or better, of which 91% was in vintage
    year 2005 and prior at December 31, 2009. These older
    vintages from 2005 and prior benefit from better underwriting,
    improved enhancement levels and higher residential property
    price appreciation. Approximately 66% and 73% of this portfolio
    was rated NAIC 2 or better at December 31, 2010 and 2009,

Evaluating

Available-for-Sale

Securities for

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment

As described more fully in Note 1, the Company performs a
    regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its

available-for-sale

securities holdings, including fixed maturity securities, equity
    securities and perpetual hybrid securities, in accordance with
    its impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such
    investments are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    April 1, 2009, the Company adopted OTTI guidance that
    amends the methodology for determining for fixed maturity
    securities whether an OTTI exists, and for certain fixed
    maturity securities, changes how the amount of the OTTI loss
    that is charged to earnings is determined. There was no change
    in the OTTI methodology for equity securities.

Fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss greater than $10 million, decreased
    $2.5 billion during the year ended December 31, 2010.
    The cause of the decline in, or improvement in, gross unrealized
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2010, was primarily
    attributable to a decrease in interest rates and narrowing of
    credit spreads. These securities were included in the
    Company’s OTTI review process. Based upon the
    Company’s current evaluation of these securities and other

available-for-sale

securities in an unrealized loss position in accordance with its
    impairment policy, and the Company’s current intentions and
    assessments (as applicable to the type of security) about
    holding, selling and any requirements to sell these securities,
    the Company has concluded that these securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    and severity of an unrealized loss position for equity
    securities is given greater weight and consideration than for
    fixed maturity securities. An extended and severe unrealized
    loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any
    impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled
    interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for an equity security,
    greater weight and consideration is given by the Company to a
    decline in market value and the likelihood such market value
    decline will recover.

The following table presents certain information about the
    Company’s equity securities

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process, the Company evaluated its holdings in non-redeemable
    preferred stock, particularly those companies in the financial
    services industry. The Company considered several factors
    including whether there has been any deterioration in credit of
    the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of
    non-redeemable preferred stock with a severe or an extended
    unrealized loss. The

F-66


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company also considered whether any issuers of non-redeemable
    preferred stock with an unrealized loss held by the Company,
    regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend
    payments. No such dividend payments had been deferred.

With respect to common stock holdings, the Company considered
    the duration and severity of the unrealized losses for
    securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more; and
    the duration of unrealized losses for securities in an
    unrealized loss position of less than 20% in an extended
    unrealized loss position (i.e., 12 months or greater).

Future OTTIs will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
    issuer performance (including changes in the present value of
    future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit
    rating, changes in collateral valuation, changes in interest
    rates and changes in credit spreads. If economic fundamentals
    and any of the above factors deteriorate, additional OTTIs may
    be incurred in upcoming quarters.

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities and short-term investments, are loaned to third
    parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. The
    Company generally obtains collateral, generally cash, in an
    amount equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the
    securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan
    and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the
    duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions
    may be sold or repledged by the transferee. The Company is
    liable to return to its counterparties the cash collateral under
    its control. These transactions are treated as financing
    arrangements and the associated liability is recorded at the
    amount of the cash received.

Open — meaning that the related loaned security could
    be returned to the Company on the next business day requiring
    the Company to immediately return the cash collateral.

The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to
    the cash collateral on open at December 31, 2010 was $2.7
    billion, of which $2.3 billion were U.S. Treasury, agency
    and government guaranteed securities which, if put to the
    Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy the cash
    requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan were
    primarily U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed
    securities, and very liquid RMBS. The reinvestment portfolio
    acquired with the cash collateral consisted principally of fixed
    maturity securities (including RMBS, U.S. corporate,
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed and ABS).

Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection
    with the securities lending transactions may not be sold or
    repledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements. Separately,
    the Company had $49 million and $46 million, at
    estimated fair value, of cash and security collateral on deposit
    from a counterparty to secure its interest in a pooled
    investment that is held by a third-party trustee, as custodian,
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This pooled
    investment is included within fixed maturity securities and had
    an estimated fair value of $49 million and $51 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Concentration of Credit Risk

— The Company
    diversifies its mortgage loan portfolio by both geographic
    region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration.
    The Company’s commercial and agricultural mortgage loans
    are collateralized by properties primarily located in the United
    States, at 91%, with the remaining 9% collateralized by
    properties located outside the United States, calculated as a
    percent of total mortgage loans

held-for-investment

(excluding commercial mortgage loans held by CSEs) at
    December 31, 2010. The carrying value of the Company’s
    commercial and agricultural mortgage loans located in
    California, New York and Texas were 21%, 8% and 7%,
    respectively, of total mortgage loans

held-for-investment

(excluding commercial mortgage loans held by CSEs) at
    December 31, 2010. Additionally, the Company manages risk
    when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by
    generally lending only up to 75% of the estimated fair value of
    the underlying real estate.

Certain of the Company’s real estate joint ventures have
    mortgage loans with the Company. The carrying values of such
    mortgage loans were $283 million and $368 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Past Due and Interest Accrual Status of Mortgage
    Loans.

The Company has a high quality, well
    performing, mortgage loan portfolio with approximately 99% of
    all mortgage loans classified as performing.

Past Due.

The Company defines delinquent
    mortgage loans consistent with industry practice, when interest
    and principal payments are past due as follows: commercial
    mortgage loans — 60 days past due; agricultural
    mortgage loans — 90 days past due; and
    residential mortgage loans — 60 days past due.
    The recorded investment in mortgage loans

held-for-investment,

prior to valuation allowances, past due according to these aging
    categories was $58 million, $159 million and
    $79 million for commercial, agricultural and residential
    mortgage loans, respectively, at December 31, 2010; and for
    all mortgage loans was $296 million and $220 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Accrual Status. Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing
    Interest.

The recorded investment in mortgage
    loans

held-for-investment,

prior to valuation allowances, that were past due 90 days
    or more and still accruing interest was $1 million,
    $13 million and $11 million for commercial,
    agricultural and residential mortgage loans, respectively, at
    December 31, 2010; and for all mortgage loans, was
    $25 million and $14 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

Accrual Status. Mortgage Loans in Nonaccrual
    Status.

The recorded investment in mortgage loans

The Company classifies within traditional real estate its
    investment in income-producing real estate, which is comprised
    primarily of wholly-owned real estate and, to a much lesser
    extent joint ventures with interests in single property
    income-producing real estate. The Company classifies within real
    estate joint ventures and funds, its investments in joint
    ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying
    strategies ranging from the development of properties to the
    operation of income-producing properties as well as its
    investments in real estate private equity funds. From time to
    time, the Company transfers investments from these joint
    ventures to traditional real estate, if the Company retains an
    interest in the joint venture after a completed property
    commences operations and the Company intends to retain an
    interest in the property.

Properties acquired through foreclosure were $165 million,
    $127 million and less than $1 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
    includes commercial, agricultural and residential properties.
    After the Company acquires properties through foreclosure, it
    evaluates whether the property is appropriate for retention in
    its traditional real estate portfolio. Foreclosed real estate
    held at December 31, 2010 and 2009 includes those
    properties the Company has not selected for retention in its
    traditional real estate portfolio and which do not meet the
    criteria to be classified as

held-for-sale.

The wholly-owned real estate within traditional real estate is
    net of accumulated depreciation of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Related
    depreciation expense on traditional wholly-owned real estate was
    $151 million, $135 million and $136 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. These amounts include depreciation expense related
    to discontinued operations of less than $1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2010, and $1 million for both
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The estimated
    fair value of the traditional real estate investment portfolio
    was $6.6 billion and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2010, and
    2009, respectively.

Impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-investment

were $48 million, $160 million and $20 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-sale

were $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    There were no impairments recognized on real estate

held-for-sale

for each of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
    Company’s carrying value of real estate

held-for-sale

has been reduced by impairments recorded prior to 2009 of
    $1 million at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The
    carrying value of non-income producing real estate was
    $137 million, $76 million and $28 million at
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Company diversifies its real estate investments by both
    geographic region and property type to reduce risk of
    concentration. The Company’s real estate investments are
    primarily located in the United States, at 88%, with the

F-79


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

remaining 12% located outside the United States , at
    December 31, 2010. The three locations with the largest
    real estate investments were California, Florida and Japan at
    21%, 12% and 10%, respectively, at December 31, 2010.

    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that principally make private equity investments in
    companies in the United States and overseas) was
    $6.4 billion and $5.5 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Included within other limited
    partnership interests were $1.0 billion, at both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, of investments in hedge funds.
    Impairments of other limited partnership interests, principally
    cost method other limited partnership interests, were
    $12 million, $354 million and $105 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Collectively
    Significant Equity Method Investments

The Company holds investments in real estate joint ventures,
    real estate funds and other limited partnership interests
    consisting of leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds, private
    equity funds, joint ventures and other funds. The portion of
    these investments accounted for under the equity method had a
    carrying value of $8.7 billion as of December 31,
    2010. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss related to
    these equity method investments is limited to the carrying value
    of these investments plus unfunded commitments of
    $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2010. Except for
    certain real estate joint ventures, the Company’s
    investments in real estate funds and other limited partnership
    interests are generally of a passive nature in that the Company
    does not participate in the management of the entities.

As further described in Note 1, the Company generally
    records its share of earnings in its equity method investments
    using a three-month lag methodology and within net investment
    income. As of December 31, 2010, aggregate net investment
    income from these equity method real estate joint ventures, real
    estate funds and other limited partnership interests exceeded
    10% of the Company’s consolidated pre-tax income (loss)
    from continuing operations. Accordingly, the Company is
    providing the following aggregated summarized financial data for
    such equity method investments. This aggregated summarized
    financial data does not represent the Company’s
    proportionate share of the assets, liabilities, or earnings of
    such entities.

As of, and for the year ended December 31, 2010, the
    aggregated summarized financial data presented below reflects
    the latest available financial information. Aggregate total
    assets of these entities totaled $262.9 billion and

F-80


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$209.9 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. Aggregate total liabilities of these entities
    totaled $77.6 billion and $64.5 billion as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Aggregate net
    income (loss) of these entities totaled $18.7 billion,
    $22.8 billion and ($23.3) billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Aggregate
    net income (loss) from real estate joint ventures, real estate
    funds and other limited partnership interests is primarily
    comprised of investment income, including recurring investment
    income and realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).

    low-income housing and other social causes, where the primary
    return on investment is in the form of income tax credits, and
    are accounted for under the equity method or under the effective
    yield method. Joint venture investments are accounted for under
    the equity method and represent the Company’s investment in
    insurance underwriting joint ventures in China, Japan (see
    Note 2) and Chile. Funds withheld represent amounts
    contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with

    receivable is performing or non-performing. The Company
    generally defines non-performing rental receivables as those
    that are 90 days or more past due. The determination of
    performing or non-performing status is assessed monthly. As of
    December 31, 2010, all of the rental receivables were
    performing.

The Company’s deferred income tax liability related to
    leveraged leases was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company recognizes the rights to service residential
    mortgage loans as MSRs. MSRs are either acquired or are
    generated from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans
    where the servicing rights are retained by the Company. MSRs are
    carried at estimated fair value and changes in estimated fair
    value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and
    assumptions and to the collection of expected cash flows, are
    reported in other revenues in the period in which the change
    occurs. Valuation inputs and assumptions include generally
    observable inputs such as type and age of loan, loan interest
    rates, current market interest rates and certain unobservable
    inputs, including assumptions regarding estimates of discount
    rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs, all of which are
    sensitive to changing market conditions. See Note 5 for
    further information about how the estimated fair value of MSRs
    is determined and other related information.

Short-term
    Investments

The carrying value of short-term investments, which includes
    investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but
    greater than three months, at the time of purchase was
    $9.4 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company is exposed to
    concentrations of credit risk related to securities of the

U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies
    included within short-term investments, which were
    $4.0 billion and $7.5 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Cash
    Equivalents

The carrying value of cash equivalents, which includes
    investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
    months or less, at the time of purchase was $9.6 billion
    and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company is exposed to concentrations of credit
    risk related to securities of the U.S. government and
    certain U.S. government agencies included within cash
    equivalents, which were $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Purchased
    Credit Impaired Investments

Investments acquired with evidence of credit quality
    deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at
    the acquisition date that the Company will be unable to collect
    all contractually required payments are classified as purchased
    credit impaired investments. For each investment, the excess of
    the cash flows expected to be collected as of the acquisition
    date over its acquisition date fair value is referred to as the
    accretable yield and is recognized as net investment income on
    an effective yield basis. If subsequently, based on current
    information and events, it is probable that there is a
    significant increase in cash flows previously expected to be
    collected or if actual cash flows are significantly greater than
    cash flows previously expected to be collected, the accretable
    yield is adjusted prospectively. The excess of the contractually
    required payments (including interest) as of the acquisition
    date over the cash flows expected to be collected as of the
    acquisition date is referred to as the nonaccretable difference,
    and this amount is not expected to be realized as net investment
    income. Decreases in cash flows expected to be collected can
    result in OTTI or the recognition of mortgage loan valuation
    allowances (see Note 1).

Variable
    Interest Entities

The Company holds investments in certain entities that are VIEs.
    In certain instances, the Company holds both the power to direct
    the most significant activities of the entity, as well as an
    economic interest in the entity and, as such, consistent with
    the new guidance described in Note 1, is deemed to be the
    primary beneficiary or consolidator of the entity. The following
    table presents the total assets and total liabilities relating
    to VIEs for which the Company has concluded that it is the
    primary beneficiary and which are consolidated in the
    Company’s financial statements at December 31, 2010
    and 2009. Creditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs where
    the Company is the primary beneficiary have no recourse to the
    general credit of the Company, as the Company’s obligation
    to the VIEs is limited to the amount of its committed investment.

As discussed in Note 1, upon the adoption of new guidance
    effective January 1, 2010, the Company consolidated former
    QSPEs that are structured as CMBS and former QSPEs that are
    structured as collateralized debt obligations. At
    December 31, 2010, these entities held total assets of
    $7,114 million, consisting of $201 million of FVO
    securities held by CSEs classified within trading and other
    securities, $6,840 million of commercial mortgage loans,
    $34 million of accrued investment income and
    $39 million of cash. These entities had total liabilities
    of $6,892 million, consisting of $6,820 million of
    long-term debt and $72 million of other liabilities. The
    assets of these entities can only be used to settle their
    respective liabilities, and under no circumstances is the
    Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates liable for any
    principal or interest shortfalls should any arise. The
    Company’s exposure is limited to that of its remaining
    investment in the

former QSPEs of $201 million at estimated fair value at
    December 31, 2010. The long-term debt referred to above
    bears interest at primarily fixed rates ranging from 2.25% to
    5.57%, payable primarily on a monthly basis and is expected to
    be repaid over the next 7 years. Interest expense related
    to these obligations, included in other expenses, was
    $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

(1)

The maximum exposure to loss relating to the fixed maturity,
    equity and trading securities is equal to the carrying amounts
    or carrying amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure
    to loss relating to the other limited partnership interests and
    real estate joint ventures is equal to the carrying amounts plus
    any unfunded commitments of the Company. Such a maximum loss
    would be expected to occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or
    investee. The maximum exposure to loss relating to the mortgage
    loans is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded
    commitments of the Company. For certain of its investments in
    other invested assets, the Company’s return is in the form
    of income tax credits which are guaranteed by a creditworthy
    third-party. For such investments, the maximum exposure to loss
    is equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments,
    reduced by amounts guaranteed by third parties of
    $231 million and $232 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

(2)

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted new guidance
    effective January 1, 2010 which eliminated the concept of a
    QSPE. As a result, the Company concluded it held variable
    interests in RMBS, CMBS and ABS. For these interests, the
    Company’s involvement is limited to that of a passive
    investor.

As described in Note 16, the Company makes commitments to
    fund partnership investments in the normal course of business.
    Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide
    financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce
    market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter
    interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets
    and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap,
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
    interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed
    notional principal amount. These transactions are entered into
    pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. The
    Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow
    and non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company also enters into basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows from assets and related liabilities. In a basis swap,
    both legs of the swap are floating with each based on a
    different index. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset
    of the contract and no principal payments are made by either
    party. A single net payment is usually made by one counterparty
    at each due date. Basis swaps are included in interest rate
    swaps in the preceding table. The Company utilizes basis swaps
    in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Inflation swaps are used as an economic hedge to reduce
    inflation risk generated from inflation-indexed liabilities.
    Inflation swaps are included in interest rate swaps in the
    preceding table. The Company utilizes inflation swaps in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Implied volatility swaps are used by the Company primarily as
    economic hedges of interest rate risk associated with the
    Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities. In an
    implied volatility swap, the Company exchanges fixed payments
    for floating payments that are linked to certain market
    volatility measures. If implied volatility rises, the floating
    payments that the Company receives will increase, and if implied
    volatility falls, the floating payments that the Company
    receives will decrease. Implied volatility swaps are included in
    interest rate

    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

swaps in the preceding table. The Company utilizes implied
    volatility swaps in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company purchases interest rate caps and floors primarily to
    protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest
    rates above a specified level, and against interest rate
    exposure arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities
    (duration mismatches), as well as to protect its minimum rate
    guarantee liabilities against declines in interest rates below a
    specified level, respectively. In certain instances, the Company
    locks in the economic impact of existing purchased caps and
    floors by entering into offsetting written caps and floors. The
    Company utilizes interest rate caps and floors in non-qualifying
    hedging relationships.

In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures
    transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified
    number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the
    different classes of interest rate securities, and to post
    variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the
    difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The
    Company enters into exchange- traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.
    Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are
    used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of
    assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported
    by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities
    the Company owns or anticipates acquiring and to hedge against
    changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by
    replicating Treasury or swap curve performance. The Company
    utilizes exchange-traded interest rate futures in non-qualifying
    hedging relationships.

Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk
    associated with the Company’s long-term liabilities and
    invested assets. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap
    with a forward starting effective date. In certain instances,
    the Company locks in the economic impact of existing purchased
    swaptions by entering into offsetting written swaptions. The
    Company pays a premium for purchased swaptions and receives a
    premium for written swaptions. Swaptions are included in
    interest rate options in the preceding table. The Company
    utilizes swaptions in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company writes covered call options on its portfolio of
    U.S. Treasuries as an income generation strategy. In a
    covered call transaction, the Company receives a premium at the
    inception of the contract in exchange for giving the derivative
    counterparty the right to purchase the referenced security from
    the Company at a predetermined price. The call option is
    “covered” because the Company owns the referenced
    security over the term of the option. Covered call options are
    included in interest rate options in the preceding table. The
    Company utilizes covered call options in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

The Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell
    securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract
    and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
    date. The Company also uses interest rate forwards to sell to be
    announced securities as economic hedges against the risk of
    changes in the fair value of mortgage loans

held-for-sale

and interest rate lock commitments. The Company utilizes
    interest rate forwards in cash flow and non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Interest rate lock commitments are short-term commitments to
    fund mortgage loan applications in process (the pipeline) for a
    fixed term for a fixed rate or spread. During the term of an
    interest rate lock commitment, the Company is exposed to the
    risk that interest rates will change from the rate quoted to the
    potential borrower. Interest rate lock commitments to fund
    mortgage loans that will be

held-for-sale

are considered derivative instruments. Interest rate lock
    commitments are included in interest rate forwards in the
    preceding table. Interest rate lock commitments are not
    designated as hedging instruments.

A synthetic GIC is a contract that simulates the performance of
    a traditional guaranteed interest contract through the use of
    financial instruments. Under a synthetic GIC, the policyholder
    owns the underlying assets. The Company guarantees a rate return
    on those assets for a premium. Synthetic GICs are not designated
    as hedging instruments.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Foreign currency derivatives, including foreign currency swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and currency option contracts, are
    used by the Company to reduce the risk from fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also
    uses foreign currency forwards and swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency risk associated with certain of its net investments in
    foreign operations.

In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the
    difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange
    rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon principal amount. The principal amount of each
    currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the
    currency swap by each party. The Company utilizes foreign
    currency swaps in fair value, cash flow, net investment in
    foreign operations and non-qualifying hedging relationships.

In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees
    with another party to deliver a specified amount of an
    identified currency at a specified future date. The price is
    agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a
    contract is made in a different currency at the specified future
    date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in net
    investment in foreign operations and non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

In exchange-traded currency futures transactions, the Company
    agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the
    value of which is determined by referenced currencies, and to
    post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the
    difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The
    Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.
    Exchange-traded currency futures are used primarily to hedge
    currency mismatches between assets and liabilities. The Company
    utilizes exchange-traded currency futures in non-qualifying
    hedging relationships.

The Company enters into currency option contracts that give it
    the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency
    amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a
    limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be
    net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign
    exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency
    options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent
    in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also
    uses currency options as an economic hedge of foreign currency
    exposure related to the Company’s international
    subsidiaries. The Company utilizes currency options in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company uses certain of its foreign currency denominated
    funding agreements to hedge portions of its net investments in
    foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
    Such contracts are included in non-derivative hedging
    instruments in the preceding table.

Swap spreadlocks are used by the Company to hedge invested
    assets on an economic basis against the risk of changes in
    credit spreads. Swap spreadlocks are forward transactions
    between two parties whose underlying reference index is a
    forward starting interest rate swap where the Company agrees to
    pay a coupon based on a predetermined reference swap spread in
    exchange for receiving a coupon based on a floating rate. The
    Company has the option to cash settle with the counterparty in
    lieu of maintaining the swap after the effective date. The
    Company utilizes swap spreadlocks in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Certain credit default swaps are used by the Company to hedge
    against credit-related changes in the value of its investments
    and to diversify its credit risk exposure in certain portfolios.
    In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party, at specified intervals, to pay a premium to hedge
    credit risk. If a credit event, as defined by the contract,
    occurs, generally the contract will require the swap to be
    settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the
    referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional in
    exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty
    equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. The
    Company utilizes credit default swaps in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Credit default swaps are also used to synthetically create
    investments that are either more expensive to acquire or
    otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions
    are a combination of a derivative and a cash

instrument such as a U.S. Treasury or Agency security. The
    Company also enters into certain credit default swaps held in
    relation to trading portfolios for the purpose of generating
    profits on short-term differences in price. These credit default
    swaps are not designated as hedging instruments.

The Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid
    for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed
    upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is
    made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of
    entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of
    changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the
    Company designates these as credit forwards. The Company
    utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships.

In exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company
    agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the
    value of which is determined by the different classes of equity
    securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an
    amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of
    those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures
    with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of
    the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily
    to hedge liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity
    products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes
    exchange-traded equity futures in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in
    equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the
    equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The
    contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in
    the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price.
    Certain of these contracts may also contain settlement
    provisions linked to interest rates. In certain instances, the
    Company may enter into a combination of transactions to hedge
    adverse changes in equity indices within a pre-determined range
    through the purchase and sale of options. Equity index options
    are included in equity options in the preceding table. The
    Company utilizes equity index options in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company
    agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future,
    based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period.
    Equity variance swaps are included in variance swaps in the
    preceding table. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”) are swaps whereby
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward
    of an asset or a market index and the London Inter-Bank Offer
    Rate (“LIBOR”), calculated by reference to an agreed
    notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at the outset of
    the contract. Cash is paid and received over the life of the
    contract based on the terms of the swap. These transactions are
    entered into pursuant to master agreements that provide for a
    single net payment to be made by the counterparty at each due
    date. The Company uses TRRs to hedge its equity market
    guarantees in certain of its insurance products. TRRs can be
    used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The
    Company utilizes TRRs in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Fair
    Value Hedges

The Company designates and accounts for the following as fair
    value hedges when they have met the requirements of fair value
    hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate
    investments to floating rate investments; (ii) interest
    rate swaps to convert fixed rate liabilities to floating rate
    liabilities; and (iii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency fair value exposure of foreign currency
    denominated investments and liabilities.

The Company recognizes gains and losses on derivatives and the
    related hedged items in fair value hedges within net derivative
    gains (losses). The following table represents the amount of

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash
    flow hedges when they have met the requirements of cash flow
    hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating rate
    investments to fixed rate investments; (ii) interest rate
    swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate
    liabilities; (iii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency
    denominated investments and liabilities; (iv) interest rate
    forwards and credit forwards to lock in the price to be paid for
    forward purchases of investments; (v) interest rate swaps
    and interest rate forwards to hedge the forecasted purchases of
    fixed-rate investments; and (vi) interest rate swaps and
    interest rate forwards to hedge forecasted fixed-rate borrowings.

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company
    recognized $1 million and ($3) million, respectively,
    of net derivative gains (losses) which represented the
    ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company did not recognize any net
    derivative gains (losses) which represented the ineffective
    portion of all cash flow hedges. All components of each
    derivative’s gain or loss were included in the assessment
    of hedge effectiveness. In certain instances, the Company
    discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the forecasted
    transactions did not occur on the anticipated date or within two
    months of that date. The net amounts reclassified into net
    derivative gains (losses) for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008 related to such discontinued cash flow
    hedges were gains (losses) of $9 million, ($7) million
    and ($12) million, respectively. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the maximum length of time over which the Company was
    hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows for
    forecasted transactions did not exceed seven years and five
    years, respectively. There were no hedged forecasted
    transactions, other than the receipt or payment of variable
    interest payments, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Hedges
    of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts, which may include
    foreign currency swaps, forwards and options, to hedge portions
    of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse
    movements in exchange rates. The Company measures
    ineffectiveness on these contracts based upon the change in
    forward rates. In addition, the Company may also use
    non-derivative financial instruments to hedge portions of its
    net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements
    in exchange rates. The Company measures ineffectiveness on
    non-derivative financial instruments based upon the change in
    spot rates.

When net investments in foreign operations are sold or
    substantially liquidated, the amounts in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations, while a pro rata portion will be
    reclassified upon partial sale of the net investments in foreign
    operations.

During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2008, there
    were no sales or substantial liquidations of net investments in
    foreign operations that would have required the reclassification
    of gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into earnings. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, the Company substantially liquidated, through assumption
    reinsurance (see Note 2), the portion of its Canadian
    operations that was being hedged in a net investment hedging
    relationship. As a result, the Company reclassified losses of
    $133 million from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) into earnings.

(2)

There was no ineffectiveness recognized for the Company’s
    hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the cumulative foreign
    currency translation gain (loss) recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to hedges of net investments
    in foreign operations was ($223) million and
    ($40) million, respectively.

Non-Qualifying
    Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than
    Hedging

The Company enters into the following derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting or for purposes other than hedging:
    (i) interest rate swaps, implied volatility swaps, caps and
    floors and interest rate futures to economically hedge its
    exposure to interest rates; (ii) foreign currency forwards,
    swaps, option contracts, and future contracts to economically
    hedge its exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates;
    (iii) credit default swaps to economically hedge exposure
    to adverse movements in credit; (iv) equity futures, equity
    index options, interest rate futures, TRRs and equity variance
    swaps to economically hedge liabilities embedded in certain
    variable annuity products; (v) swap spreadlocks to
    economically hedge invested assets against the risk of changes
    in credit spreads; (vi) interest rate forwards to buy and
    sell securities to economically hedge its exposure to interest
    rates; (vii) credit default swaps and TRRs to synthetically
    create investments; (viii) basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows of assets and related liabilities; (ix) credit
    default swaps held in relation to trading portfolios;
    (x) swaptions to hedge interest rate risk;
    (xi) inflation swaps to reduce risk generated from
    inflation-indexed liabilities; (xii) covered call options
    for income generation; (xiii) interest rate lock
    commitments; (xiv) synthetic GICs; and (xv) equity
    options to economically hedge certain invested assets against
    adverse changes in equity indices.

Credit
    Derivatives

In connection with synthetically created investment transactions
    and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading
    portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it
    receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit
    derivatives are included within the non-qualifying derivatives
    and derivatives for purposes other than hedging table. If a
    credit event occurs, as defined by the contract, generally the
    contract will require the Company to pay the counterparty the
    specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of
    par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The
    Company’s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all
    referenced credit obligations is zero, was $5,089 million
    and $3,101 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any
    time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount
    equal to the then current fair value of the credit default
    swaps. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company would
    have received $62 million and $53 million,
    respectively, to terminate all of these contracts.

The following table presents the estimated fair value, maximum
    amount of future payments and weighted average years to maturity
    of written credit default swaps at December 31, 2010 and
    2009:

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to
    purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit
    obligations in the table above. As a result, the maximum amounts
    of potential future recoveries available to offset the
    $5,089 million and $3,101 million from the table above
    were $120 million and $31 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Credit
    Risk on Freestanding Derivatives

The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event
    of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
    instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the
    Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the net
    positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the
    reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of
    netting agreements and any collateral received pursuant to
    credit support annexes.

The Company manages its credit risk related to

over-the-counter

derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange-traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments. See Note 5
    for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation
    of derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the Company was obligated to return cash
    collateral under its control of $2,625 million and
    $2,680 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents or in
    short-term investments and the obligation to return it is
    included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and
    other transactions in the consolidated balance sheets. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had also accepted
    collateral consisting of various securities with a fair market
    value of $984 million and $221 million, respectively,
    which were held in separate custodial accounts. The Company is
    permitted by contract to sell or repledge this collateral, but
    at December 31, 2010, none of the collateral had been sold
    or repledged.

The Company’s collateral arrangements for its

over-the-counter

derivatives generally require the counterparty in a net
    liability position, after considering the effect of netting
    agreements, to pledge collateral when the fair value of that
    counterparty’s derivatives reaches a pre-determined
    threshold. Certain of these arrangements also include
    credit-contingent provisions that provide for a reduction of
    these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero)
    in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company

and/or

the
    counterparty. In addition, certain of the Company’s netting
    agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that
    require the Company to maintain a specific investment grade
    credit rating from at least one of the major credit rating
    agencies. If the Company’s credit ratings were to fall
    below that specific investment grade credit rating, it would be
    in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the
    derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand
    immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on
    derivative instruments that are in a net liability position
    after considering the effect of netting agreements.

The following table presents the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s

over-the-counter

derivatives that are in a net liability position after
    considering the effect of netting agreements, together with the
    estimated fair value and

balance sheet location of the collateral pledged. The table also
    presents the incremental collateral that the Company would be
    required to provide if there was a one notch downgrade in the
    Company’s credit rating at the reporting date or if the
    Company’s credit rating sustained a downgrade to a level
    that triggered full overnight collateralization or termination
    of the derivative position at the reporting date. Derivatives
    that are not subject to collateral agreements are not included
    in the scope of this table.

Without considering the effect of netting agreements, the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s

over-the-counter

derivatives with credit-contingent provisions that were in a
    gross liability position at December 31, 2010 was
    $1,742 million. At December 31, 2010, the Company
    provided securities collateral of $1,024 million in
    connection with these derivatives. In the unlikely event that
    both: (i) the Company’s credit rating was downgraded
    to a level that triggers full overnight collateralization or
    termination of all derivative positions; and (ii) the
    Company’s netting agreements were deemed to be legally
    unenforceable, then the additional collateral that the Company
    would be required to provide to its counterparties in connection
    with its derivatives in a gross liability position at
    December 31, 2010 would be $718 million. This amount
    does not consider gross derivative assets of $575 million
    for which the Company has the contractual right of offset.

The Company also has exchange-traded futures and options, which
    require the pledging of collateral. At December 31, 2010
    and 2009, the Company pledged securities collateral for
    exchange-traded futures and options of $40 million and
    $50 million, respectively, which is included in fixed
    maturity securities. The counterparties are permitted by
    contract to sell or repledge this collateral. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company provided cash
    collateral for exchange-traded futures and options of
    $662 million and $562 million, respectively, which is
    included in premiums, reinsurance and other receivables.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company has certain embedded derivatives that are required
    to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as
    derivatives. These host contracts principally include: variable
    annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits, including GMWBs,
    GMABs and certain GMIBs; ceded reinsurance contracts of
    guaranteed minimum benefits related to GMABs and certain GMIBs;
    and funding agreements with equity or bond indexed crediting
    rates.

    $2,994 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Net derivative gains (losses) for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 included a loss of
    $955 million relating to a refinement for estimating
    nonperformance risk in fair value measurements implemented at
    June 30, 2010. See Note 5.

Fair
    Value

Considerable judgment is often required in interpreting market
    data to develop estimates of fair value and the use of different
    assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Equity Securities, Trading and Other
    Securities and Short-term Investments

When available, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    fixed maturity, equity and trading and other securities are
    based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and
    regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of
    the Company’s securities holdings and valuation of these
    securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies
    include, but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing
    of the issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer,
    coupon rate, call provisions, sinking fund requirements,
    maturity and management’s assumptions regarding estimated
    duration, liquidity and estimated future cash flows.
    Accordingly, the estimated fair values are based on available
    market information and management’s judgments about
    financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally

F-105


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

from or corroborated by observable market data. Such observable
    inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the
    circumstances.

The estimated fair value of FVO securities held by CSEs is
    determined on a basis consistent with the methodologies
    described herein for fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities. As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted new
    guidance effective January 1, 2010 and consolidated certain
    securitization entities that hold securities that have been
    accounted for under the FVO and classified within trading and
    other securities.

The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs may
    have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the
    Company’s securities holdings.

Mortgage
    Loans

Mortgage loans presented in the tables above consist of
    commercial mortgage loans held by CSEs and residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

for which the Company has elected the FVO and which are carried
    at estimated fair value. As discussed in Note 1, the
    Company adopted new guidance effective January 1, 2010 and
    consolidated certain securitization entities that hold
    commercial mortgage loans. See “— Valuation
    Techniques and Inputs by Level Within the
    Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy by Major Classes of Assets
    and Liabilities” below for a discussion of the methods and
    assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial
    instruments.

MSRs

Although MSRs are not financial instruments, the Company has
    included them in the preceding table as a result of its election
    to carry MSRs at estimated fair value. See
    “— Valuation Techniques and Inputs by
    Level Within the Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy by
    Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities” below for a
    discussion of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the
    fair value of these financial instruments.

Other
    Invested Assets — Investment Funds

The estimated fair value of these investment funds is determined
    on a basis consistent with the methodologies described herein
    for trading and other securities.

Derivatives

The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through
    the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives
    and interest rate forwards to sell certain to be announced
    securities, or through the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The significant inputs to the pricing models for most

over-the-counter

derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data.

F-106


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Significant inputs that are observable generally include:
    interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate
    curves, credit curves and volatility. However, certain

over-the-counter

derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the
    estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data. Significant inputs that are unobservable generally
    include: independent broker quotes, credit correlation
    assumptions, references to emerging market currencies and inputs
    that are outside the observable portion of the interest rate
    curve, credit curve, volatility or other relevant market
    measure. These unobservable inputs may involve significant
    management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable,
    these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given
    the circumstances and are assumed to be consistent with what
    other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments.

The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are
    considered in determining the estimated fair value for all

over-the-counter

derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the
    net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the
    effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The
    Company values its derivative positions using the standard swap
    curve which includes a spread to the risk free rate. This credit
    spread is appropriate for those parties that execute trades at
    pricing levels consistent with the standard swap curve. As the
    Company and its significant derivative counterparties
    consistently execute trades at such pricing levels, additional
    credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the
    valuation process. The Company’s ability to consistently
    execute at such pricing levels is in part due to the netting
    agreements and collateral arrangements that are in place with
    all of its significant derivative counterparties. The evaluation
    of the requirement to make additional credit risk adjustments is
    performed by the Company each reporting period.

Most inputs for

over-the-counter

derivatives are mid market inputs but, in certain cases, bid
    level inputs are used when they are deemed more representative
    of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair values of the Company’s
    derivatives and could materially affect net income.

Embedded
    Derivatives Within Asset and Liability Host Contracts

Embedded derivatives principally include certain direct, assumed
    and ceded variable annuity guarantees and equity or bond indexed
    crediting rates within certain funding agreements. Embedded
    derivatives are recorded in the consolidated financial
    statements at estimated fair value with changes in estimated
    fair value reported in net income.

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit guarantees. GMWBs, GMABs and certain
    GMIBs are embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated
    fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract,
    with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative
    gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within
    policyholder account balances in the consolidated balance sheets.

The fair value of these guarantees is estimated using the
    present value of future benefits minus the present value of
    future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions
    related to the projected cash flows over the expected lives of
    the contracts. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used
    under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected
    under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk
    free rates, currency exchange rates and observable and estimated
    implied volatilities.

The valuation of these guarantee liabilities includes
    adjustments for nonperformance risk and for a risk margin
    related to non-capital market inputs. Both of these adjustments
    are captured as components of the spread which, when combined
    with the risk free rate, is used to discount the cash flows of
    the liability for purposes of determining its fair value.

The nonperformance adjustment is determined by taking into
    consideration publicly available information relating to spreads
    in the secondary market for the Holding Company’s debt,
    including related credit default swaps.

These observable spreads are then adjusted, as necessary, to
    reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying
    ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to the
    Holding Company.

Risk margins are established to capture the non-capital market
    risks of the instrument which represent the additional
    compensation a market participant would require to assume the
    risks related to the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions
    as annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and
    surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use
    of significant management judgment, including assumptions of the
    amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees. These
    guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in
    nonperformance risk; and variations in actuarial assumptions
    regarding policyholder behavior, mortality and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB described above. These reinsurance contracts contain
    embedded derivatives which are included in premiums, reinsurance
    and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets with
    changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains
    (losses) or policyholder benefits and claims depending on the
    statement of operations classification of the direct risk. The
    value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is
    determined using a methodology consistent with that described
    previously for the guarantees directly written by the Company.

As part of its regular review of critical accounting estimates,
    the Company periodically assesses inputs for estimating
    nonperformance risk (commonly referred to as “own
    credit”) in fair value measurements. During the second
    quarter of 2010, the Company completed a study that aggregated
    and evaluated data, including historical recovery rates of
    insurance companies, as well as policyholder behavior observed
    over the past two years as the recent financial crisis evolved.
    As a result, at the end of the second quarter of 2010, the
    Company refined the way in which its insurance subsidiaries
    incorporate expected recovery rates into the nonperformance risk
    adjustment for purposes of estimating the fair value of
    investment-type contracts and embedded derivatives within
    insurance contracts. The Company recognized a loss of
    $577 million, net of DAC and income tax, relating to
    implementing the refinement at June 30, 2010. The
    refinement reduced both basic and diluted net income available
    to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per common share by
    $0.65 for the year ended December 31, 2010.

The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within
    funds withheld related to certain ceded reinsurance is
    determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the
    underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio
    backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value
    of the underlying assets is determined as described above in
    “— Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities,
    Trading and Other Securities and Short-term Investments.”
    The estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is
    included, along with their funds withheld hosts, in other
    liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with changes in
    estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses).
    Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying assets, interest
    rates and market volatility may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded
    derivatives that could materially affect net income.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is
    determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for
    nonperformance risk. The estimated fair value of these embedded
    derivatives are included, along with their funding agreements
    host, within policyholder account balances with changes in
    estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses).
    Changes in equity and bond indices, interest rates and the
    Company’s credit standing may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these embedded
    derivatives that could materially affect net income.

Separate
    Account Assets

Separate account assets are carried at estimated fair value and
    reported as a summarized total on the consolidated balance
    sheets. The estimated fair value of separate account assets is
    based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets owned
    by the separate account. Assets within the Company’s
    separate accounts include: mutual funds, fixed maturity
    securities, equity securities, mortgage loans, derivatives,
    hedge funds, other limited partnership interests, short-term
    investments and cash and cash equivalents. See
    “— Valuation Techniques and Inputs by
    Level Within the Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy by
    Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities” below for a
    discussion of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the
    fair value of these financial instruments.

Long-term
    Debt of CSEs

The Company has elected the FVO for the long-term debt of CSEs,
    which are carried at estimated fair value. See
    “— Valuation Techniques and Inputs by
    Level Within the Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy by
    Major Classes of Assets and Liabilities” below for a
    discussion of the methods and assumptions used to estimate the
    fair value of these financial instruments.

Trading
    Liabilities

Trading liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income. The estimated fair value of trading
    liabilities is determined on a basis consistent with the
    methodologies described in “— Fixed Maturity
    Securities, Equity Securities and Trading and Other
    Securities.”

Valuation
    Techniques and Inputs by Level Within the
    Three-Level Fair Value Hierarchy by Major Classes of Assets
    and Liabilities

A description of the significant valuation techniques and inputs
    to the determination of estimated fair value for the more
    significant asset and liability classes measured at fair value
    on a recurring basis is as follows:

The Company determines the estimated fair value of its
    investments using primarily the market approach and the income
    approach. The use of quoted prices for identical assets and
    matrix pricing or other similar techniques are examples of
    market approaches, while the use of discounted cash flow
    methodologies is an example of the income approach. The Company
    attempts to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize
    the use of unobservable inputs in selecting whether the market
    or income approach is used.

While certain investments have been classified as Level 1
    from the use of unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    investments supported by high volumes of trading activity and
    narrow bid/ask spreads, most investments have been classified as
    Level 2 because the significant inputs used to measure the
    fair value on a recurring basis of the same or similar
    investment are market observable or can be corroborated using
    market observable information for the full term of the
    investment. Level 3 investments include those where
    estimated fair values are based on significant unobservable
    inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and
    may reflect our own assumptions about what factors market
    participants would use in pricing these investments.

Level 1
    Measurements:

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Equity Securities, Trading and Other
    Securities and Short-term Investments

These securities are comprised of U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities, foreign
    government securities, RMBS — principally
    to-be-announced securities, exchange traded common stock,
    exchange traded mutual fund interests included in equity
    securities, exchange traded registered mutual fund interests
    included in trading and other securities and short-term money
    market securities, including U.S. Treasury bills. Valuation
    of these securities is based on unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets that are readily and

F-109

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

regularly available. Contractholder-directed unit-linked
    investments reported within trading and other securities include
    certain registered mutual fund interests priced using daily NAV
    provided by the fund managers.

Derivative
    Assets and Derivative Liabilities

These assets and liabilities are comprised of exchange-traded
    derivatives, as well as interest rate forwards to sell certain
    to be announced securities. Valuation of these assets and
    liabilities is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets that are readily and regularly available.

Separate
    Account Assets

These assets are comprised of securities that are similar in
    nature to the fixed maturity securities, equity securities and
    short-term investments referred to above; and certain
    exchange-traded derivatives, including financial futures and
    owned options. Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted prices in
    active markets that are readily and regularly available.

Level 2
    Measurements:

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Equity Securities, Trading and Other
    Securities and Short-term Investments

This level includes fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities priced principally by independent pricing services
    using observable inputs. Trading and other securities and
    short-term investments within this level are of a similar nature
    and class to the Level 2 securities described below;
    accordingly, the valuation techniques and significant market
    standard observable inputs used in their valuation are also
    similar to those described below. Contractholder-directed
    unit-linked investments reported within trading and other
    securities include certain mutual fund interests without readily
    determinable fair values given prices are not published
    publicly. Valuation of these mutual funds is based upon quoted
    prices or reported NAV provided by the fund managers, which were
    based on observable inputs.

U.S. corporate and foreign corporate
    securities.

These securities are principally
    valued using the market and income approaches. Valuation is
    based primarily on quoted prices in markets that are not active,
    or using matrix pricing or other similar techniques that use
    standard market observable inputs such as a benchmark yields,
    spreads off benchmark yields, new issuances, issuer rating,
    duration, and trades of identical or comparable securities.
    Investment grade privately placed securities are valued using a
    discounted cash flow methodologies using standard market
    observable inputs, and inputs derived from, or corroborated by,
    market observable data including market yield curve, duration,
    call provisions, observable prices and spreads for similar
    publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the
    credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. This level
    also includes certain below investment grade privately placed
    fixed maturity securities priced by independent pricing services
    that use observable inputs.

Structured securities comprised of RMBS, CMBS and
    ABS.

These securities are principally valued
    using the market approach. Valuation is based primarily on
    matrix pricing or other similar techniques using standard market
    inputs including spreads for actively traded securities, spreads
    off benchmark yields, expected prepayment speeds and volumes,
    current and forecasted loss severity, rating, weighted average
    coupon, weighted average maturity, average delinquency rates,
    geographic region, debt-service coverage ratios and
    issuance-specific information including, but not limited to:
    collateral type, payment terms of the underlying assets, payment
    priority within the tranche, structure of the security, deal
    performance and vintage of loans.

U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed
    securities.

These securities are principally
    valued using the market approach. Valuation is based primarily
    on quoted prices in markets that are not active, or using matrix
    pricing or other similar techniques using standard market
    observable inputs such as benchmark U.S. Treasury yield
    curve, the spread off the U.S. Treasury curve for the
    identical security and comparable securities that are actively
    traded.

Foreign government and state and political subdivision
    securities.

These securities are principally
    valued using the market approach. Valuation is based primarily
    on matrix pricing or other similar techniques using standard
    market observable inputs including benchmark U.S. Treasury
    or other yields, issuer ratings, broker-dealer quotes, issuer
    spreads and reported trades of similar securities, including
    those within the same

sub-sector

or with a similar maturity or credit rating.

Common and non-redeemable preferred
    stock.

These securities are principally valued
    using the market approach where market quotes are available but
    are not considered actively traded. Valuation is based
    principally on observable inputs including quoted prices in
    markets that are not considered active.

Mortgage
    Loans Held by CSEs

These commercial mortgage loans are principally valued using the
    market approach. The principal market for these commercial loan
    portfolios is the securitization market. The Company uses the
    quoted securitization market price of the obligations of the
    CSEs to determine the estimated fair value of these commercial
    loan portfolios. These market prices are determined principally
    by independent pricing services using observable inputs.

Mortgage
    Loans

Held-For-Sale

Residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

are principally valued using the market approach and valued
    primarily using readily available observable pricing for similar
    loans or securities backed by similar loans. The unobservable
    adjustments to such prices are insignificant.

Derivative
    Assets and Derivative Liabilities

This level includes all types of derivative instruments utilized
    by the Company with the exception of exchange-traded derivatives
    and interest rate forwards to sell certain to be announced
    securities included within Level 1 and those derivative
    instruments with unobservable inputs as described in
    Level 3. These derivatives are principally valued using an
    income approach.

Interest
    rate contracts.

Non-option-based — Valuations are based on present
    value techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may
    include the swap yield curve, LIBOR basis curves, and repurchase
    rates.

Option-based — Valuations are based on option pricing
    models, which utilize significant inputs that may include the
    swap yield curve, LIBOR basis curves, and interest rate
    volatility.

Foreign
    currency contracts.

Non-option-based — Valuations are based on present
    value techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may
    include the swap yield curve, LIBOR basis curves, currency spot
    rates, and cross currency basis curves.

Option-based — Valuations are based on option pricing
    models, which utilize significant inputs that may include the

    contracts.

Non-option-based — Valuations are based on present
    value techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may
    include the swap yield curve, credit curves, and recovery rates.

    include the swap yield curve, spot equity index levels, and
    dividend yield curves.

Option-based — Valuations are based on option pricing
    models, which utilize significant inputs that may include the
    swap yield curve, spot equity index levels, dividend yield
    curves, and equity volatility.

Embedded
    Derivatives Contained in Certain Funding Agreements

These derivatives are principally valued using an income
    approach. Valuations are based on present value techniques,
    which utilize significant inputs that may include the swap yield
    curve and the spot equity and bond index level.

Separate
    Account Assets

These assets are comprised of investments that are similar in
    nature to the fixed maturity securities, equity securities,
    short-term investments and derivatives referred to above. Also
    included are certain mutual funds and hedge funds without
    readily determinable fair values given prices are not published
    publicly. Valuation of the mutual funds and hedge funds is based
    upon quoted prices or reported NAV provided by the fund managers.

Long-term
    Debt of CSEs

The estimated fair value of the long-term debt of the
    Company’s CSEs is based on quoted prices when traded as
    assets in active markets or, if not available, based on market
    standard valuation methodologies, consistent with the
    Company’s methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair
    value of comparable fixed maturity securities.

Level 3
    Measurements:

In general, investments classified within Level 3 use many
    of the same valuation techniques and inputs as described above.
    However, if key inputs are unobservable, or if the investments
    are less liquid and there is very limited trading activity, the
    investments are generally classified as Level 3. The use of
    independent non-binding broker quotations to value investments
    generally indicates there is a lack of liquidity or the general
    lack of transparency in the process to develop the valuation
    estimates generally causing these investments to be classified
    in Level 3.

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Equity Securities, Trading and Other
    Securities and Short-term Investments

This level includes fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities priced principally by independent broker quotations
    or market standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are
    not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. Trading and other
    securities and short-term investments within this level are of a
    similar nature and class to the Level 3 securities
    described below; accordingly, the valuation techniques and
    significant market standard observable inputs used in their
    valuation are also similar to those described below.

U.S. corporate and foreign corporate
    securities.

These securities, including financial
    services industry hybrid securities classified within fixed
    maturity securities, are principally valued using the market and
    income approaches. Valuations are based primarily on matrix
    pricing or other similar techniques that utilize unobservable
    inputs or cannot be derived principally from, or corroborated
    by, observable market data, including illiquidity premiums and
    spread adjustments to reflect industry trends or specific
    credit-related issues. Valuations may be based on independent
    non-binding broker quotations. Generally, below investment grade
    privately placed or distressed securities included in this level
    are valued using discounted cash flow

methodologies which rely upon significant, unobservable inputs
    and inputs that cannot be derived principally from, or
    corroborated by, observable market data.

Structured securities comprised of RMBS, CMBS and
    ABS.

These securities are principally valued
    using the market approach. Valuation is based primarily on
    matrix pricing or other similar techniques that utilize inputs
    that are unobservable or cannot be derived principally from, or
    corroborated by, observable market data, or are based on
    independent non-binding broker quotations. Below investment
    grade securities and ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans included in this level are valued based on inputs
    including quoted prices for identical or similar securities that
    are less liquid and based on lower levels of trading activity
    than securities classified in Level 2, and certain of these
    securities are valued based on independent non-binding broker
    quotations.

Foreign government and state and political subdivision
    securities.

These securities are principally
    valued using the market approach. Valuation is based primarily
    on matrix pricing or other similar techniques, however these
    securities are less liquid and certain of the inputs are based
    on very limited trading activity.

Common and non-redeemable preferred
    stock.

These securities, including privately held
    securities and financial services industry hybrid securities
    classified within equity securities, are principally valued
    using the market and income approaches. Valuations are based
    primarily on matrix pricing or other similar techniques using
    inputs such as comparable credit rating and issuance structure.
    Equity securities valuations determined with discounted cash
    flow methodologies use inputs such as earnings multiples based
    on comparable public companies, and industry-specific
    non-earnings based multiples. Certain of these securities are
    valued based on independent non-binding broker quotations.

Mortgage
    Loans

Mortgage loans include residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

for which pricing for similar loans or securities backed by
    similar loans is not observable and the estimated fair value is
    determined using unobservable independent broker quotations or
    valuation models.

MSRs

MSRs, which are valued using an income approach, are carried at
    estimated fair value and have multiple significant unobservable
    inputs including assumptions regarding estimates of discount
    rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs. Sales of MSRs tend
    to occur in private transactions where the precise terms and
    conditions of the sales are typically not readily available and
    observable market valuations are limited. As such, the Company
    relies primarily on a discounted cash flow model to estimate the
    fair value of the MSRs. The model requires inputs such as type
    of loan (fixed vs. variable and agency vs. other), age of loan,
    loan interest rates and current market interest rates that are
    generally observable. The model also requires the use of
    unobservable inputs including assumptions regarding estimates of
    discount rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs.

Derivative
    Assets and Derivative Liabilities

These derivatives are principally valued using an income
    approach. Valuations of non-option-based derivatives utilize
    present value techniques, whereas valuations of option-based
    derivatives utilize option pricing models. These valuation
    methodologies generally use the same inputs as described in the
    corresponding sections above for Level 2 measurements of
    derivatives. However, these derivatives result in Level 3
    classification because one or more of the significant inputs are
    not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally
    from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

Interest
    rate contracts.

Non-option-based — Significant unobservable inputs may
    include pull through rates on interest rate lock commitments and
    the extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield
    curve and LIBOR basis curves.

    include credit correlation, repurchase rates, and the
    extrapolation beyond observable limits of the swap yield curve
    and credit curves. Certain of these derivatives are valued based
    on independent non-binding broker quotations.

Equity

    include the extrapolation beyond observable limits of dividend
    yield curves and equity volatility. Certain of these derivatives
    are valued based on independent non-binding broker quotations.

Guaranteed
    Minimum Benefit Guarantees

These embedded derivatives are principally valued using an
    income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing
    techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include
    swap yield curve, currency exchange rates and implied
    volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3
    classification because one or more of the significant inputs are
    not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally
    from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant
    unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond
    observable limits of the swap yield curve and implied
    volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior
    and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder
    behavior and mortality, nonperformance risk and cost of capital
    for purposes of calculating the risk margin.

Reinsurance
    Ceded on Certain Guaranteed Minimum Benefit Guarantees

These embedded derivatives are principally valued using an
    income approach. Valuations are based on option pricing
    techniques, which utilize significant inputs that may include
    swap yield curve, currency exchange rates and implied
    volatilities. These embedded derivatives result in Level 3
    classification because one or more of the significant inputs are
    not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally
    from, or corroborated by, observable market data. Significant
    unobservable inputs generally include: the extrapolation beyond
    observable limits of the swap yield curve and implied
    volatilities, actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior
    and mortality and the potential variability in policyholder
    behavior and mortality, counterparty credit spreads and cost of
    capital for purposes of calculating the risk margin.

Embedded
    Derivatives Within Funds Withheld Related to Certain Ceded
    Reinsurance

These derivatives are principally valued using an income
    approach. Valuations are based on present value techniques,
    which utilize significant inputs that may include the swap yield
    curve and the fair value of assets within the

F-114

reference portfolio. These embedded derivatives result in
    Level 3 classification because one or more of the
    significant inputs are not observable in the market or cannot be
    derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market
    data. Significant unobservable inputs generally include: the
    fair value of certain assets within the reference portfolio
    which are not observable in the market and cannot be derived
    principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

Separate
    Account Assets

These assets are comprised of investments that are similar in
    nature to the fixed maturity securities, equity securities and
    derivatives referred to above. Separate account assets within
    this level also include mortgage loans and other limited
    partnership interests. The estimated fair value of mortgage
    loans is determined by discounting expected future cash flows,
    using current interest rates for similar loans with similar
    credit risk. Other limited partnership interests are valued
    giving consideration to the value of the underlying holdings of
    the partnerships and by applying a premium or discount, if
    appropriate, for factors such as liquidity, bid/ask spreads, the
    performance record of the fund manager or other relevant
    variables which may impact the exit value of the particular
    partnership interest.

Long-term
    Debt of CSEs

The estimated fair value of the long-term debt of the
    Company’s CSEs are priced principally through independent
    broker quotations or market standard valuation methodologies
    using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived
    from or corroborated by observable market data.

Transfers
    between Levels 1 and 2:

During the year ended December 31, 2010, transfers between
    Levels 1 and 2 were not significant.

Transfers
    into or out of Level 3:

Overall, transfers into

and/or

out
    of Level 3 are attributable to a change in the
    observability of inputs. Assets and liabilities are transferred
    into Level 3 when a significant input cannot be
    corroborated with market observable data. This occurs when
    market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs
    cannot be observed, current prices are not available,

and/or

when
    there are significant variances in quoted prices, thereby
    affecting transparency. Assets and liabilities are transferred
    out of Level 3 when circumstances change such that a
    significant input can be corroborated with market observable
    data. This may be due to a significant increase in market
    activity, a specific event, or one or more significant input(s)
    becoming observable. Transfers into

and/or

out
    of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the
    period. Significant transfers into

and/or

out
    of Level 3 assets and liabilities for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 are summarized below.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, fixed maturity
    securities transfers into Level 3 of $1,736 million
    and separate account assets transfers into Level 3 of
    $46 million, resulted primarily from current market
    conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity,
    decreased liquidity and credit ratings downgrades (e.g., from
    investment grade to below investment grade). These current
    market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of
    valuations and an increased use of broker quotations and
    unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value
    principally for certain private placements included in
    U.S. and foreign corporate securities and certain CMBS.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, fixed maturity
    securities transfers out of Level 3 of $1,683 million
    and separate account assets transfers out of Level 3 of
    $234 million, resulted primarily from increased
    transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance
    and establishment of trading activity, became priced by
    independent pricing services and existing issuances that, over
    time, the Company was able to corroborate pricing received from
    independent pricing services with observable inputs or increases
    in market activity and upgraded credit ratings primarily for
    certain U.S. and foreign corporate securities, RMBS and ABS.

Mortgage loans —

The impaired mortgage loans
    presented above were written down to their estimated fair values
    at the date the impairments were recognized and are reported as
    losses above. Subsequent improvements in estimated fair value on
    previously impaired loans recorded through a reduction in the
    previously established valuation allowance are reported as gains
    above. Estimated fair values for impaired mortgage loans are
    based on observable market prices or, if the loans are in
    foreclosure or are otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, on the estimated fair value of the underlying
    collateral, or the present value of the expected future cash
    flows. Impairments to estimated fair value and decreases in
    previous impairments from subsequent improvements in estimated
    fair value represent non-recurring fair value measurements that
    have been categorized as Level 3 due to the lack of price
    transparency inherent in the limited markets for such mortgage
    loans.

(2)

Other limited partnership interests —

The
    impaired investments presented above were accounted for using
    the cost method. Impairments on these cost method investments
    were recognized at estimated fair value determined from
    information provided in the financial statements of the
    underlying entities in the period in which the impairment was
    incurred. These impairments to estimated fair value represent
    non-recurring fair value measurements that have been classified
    as Level 3 due to the limited activity and price
    transparency

inherent in the market for such investments. This category
    includes several private equity and debt funds that typically
    invest primarily in a diversified pool of investments across
    certain investment strategies including domestic and
    international leveraged buyout funds; power, energy, timber and
    infrastructure development funds; venture capital funds; below
    investment grade debt and mezzanine debt funds. The estimated
    fair values of these investments have been determined using the
    NAV of the Company’s ownership interest in the
    partners’ capital. Distributions from these investments
    will be generated from investment gains, from operating income
    from the underlying investments of the funds and from
    liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It is
    estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be
    liquidated over the next 2 to 10 years. Unfunded
    commitments for these investments were $34 million at
    December 31, 2010.

(3)

Real estate joint ventures —

The impaired
    investments presented above were accounted for using the cost
    method. Impairments on these cost method investments were
    recognized at estimated fair value determined from information
    provided in the financial statements of the underlying entities
    in the period in which the impairment was incurred. These
    impairments to estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair
    value measurements that have been classified as Level 3 due
    to the limited activity and price transparency inherent in the
    market for such investments. This category includes several real
    estate funds that typically invest primarily in commercial real
    estate. The estimated fair values of these investments have been
    determined using the NAV of the Company’s ownership
    interest in the partners’ capital. Distributions from these
    investments will be generated from investment gains, from
    operating income from the underlying investments of the funds
    and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It
    is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be
    liquidated over the next 2 to 10 years. Unfunded
    commitments for these investments were $6 million at
    December 31, 2010.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

The assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a
    recurring basis include: fixed maturity securities, equity
    securities, trading and other securities, mortgage loans held by
    CSEs, mortgage loans

held-for-sale

accounted for under the FVO, MSRs, derivative assets and
    liabilities, net embedded derivatives within asset and liability
    host contracts, separate account assets, long-term debt of CSEs
    and trading liabilities. These assets and liabilities are
    described in the section “— Recurring Fair Value
    Measurements” and, therefore, are excluded from the tables
    above. The estimated fair value for these financial instruments
    approximates carrying value.

Mortgage
    Loans

These mortgage loans are principally comprised of commercial and
    agricultural mortgage loans, which are originated for investment
    purposes and are primarily carried at amortized cost.
    Residential mortgage and consumer loans are generally purchased
    from third parties for investment purposes and are principally
    carried at amortized cost, while those originated for sale and
    not carried under the FVO are carried at the lower of cost or
    estimated fair value. The estimated fair values of these
    mortgage loans are determined as follows:

Mortgage loans

held-for-investment. —

For commercial and agricultural mortgage loans

held-for-investment

and carried at amortized cost, estimated fair value was
    primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows
    and discounting them using current interest rates for similar
    mortgage loans with similar credit risk. For residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-investment

and carried at amortized cost, estimated fair value was
    primarily determined from observable pricing for similar loans.

Mortgage loans

held-for-sale. —

Certain mortgage loans previously classified as

held-for-investment

have been designated as

held-for-sale.

For these mortgage loans, estimated fair value is determined
    using independent broker quotations or, when the mortgage loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral is
    estimated using internal models. For residential mortgage loans
    originated for sale, the estimated fair value is determined
    principally from observable market pricing or from internal
    models.

Policy
    Loans

For policy loans with fixed interest rates, estimated fair
    values are determined using a discounted cash flow model applied
    to groups of similar policy loans determined by the nature of
    the underlying insurance liabilities. Cash flow estimates are
    developed applying a weighted-average interest rate to the
    outstanding principal balance of the respective group of policy
    loans and an estimated average maturity determined through
    experience studies of the past performance of policyholder
    repayment behavior for similar loans. These cash flows are
    discounted using current risk-free interest rates with no
    adjustment for borrower credit risk as these loans are fully
    collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying
    insurance policy. The estimated fair value for policy loans with
    variable interest rates approximates carrying value due to the
    absence of borrower credit risk and the short time period
    between interest rate resets, which presents minimal risk of a
    material change in estimated fair value due to changes in market
    interest rates.

Real
    Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests

Real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests included in the preceding tables consist of those
    investments accounted for using the cost method. The remaining
    carrying value recognized in the consolidated balance sheets
    represents investments in real estate carried at cost less
    accumulated depreciation, or real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests accounted for using the
    equity method, which do not meet the definition of financial
    instruments for which fair value is required to be disclosed.

F-131


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The estimated fair values for other limited partnership
    interests and real estate joint ventures accounted for under the
    cost method are generally based on the Company’s share of
    the NAV as provided in the financial statements of the
    investees. In certain circumstances, management may adjust the
    NAV by a premium or discount when it has sufficient evidence to
    support applying such adjustments.

Short-term
    Investments

Certain short-term investments do not qualify as securities and
    are recognized at amortized cost in the consolidated balance
    sheets. For these instruments, the Company believes that there
    is minimal risk of material changes in interest rates or credit
    of the issuer such that estimated fair value approximates
    carrying value. In light of recent market conditions, short-term
    investments have been monitored to ensure there is sufficient
    demand and maintenance of issuer credit quality and the Company
    has determined additional adjustment is not required.

Other
    Invested Assets

Other invested assets within the preceding tables are
    principally comprised of an investment in a funding agreement,
    funds withheld, various interest-bearing assets held in foreign
    subsidiaries and certain amounts due under contractual
    indemnifications.

The estimated fair value of the investment in funding agreements
    is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using
    current market rates and the credit risk of the note issuer. For
    funds withheld and the various interest-bearing assets held in
    foreign subsidiaries, the Company evaluates the specific facts
    and circumstances of each instrument to determine the
    appropriate estimated fair values. These estimated fair values
    were not materially different from the recognized carrying
    values.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Due to the short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents,
    the Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes
    in interest rates or credit of the issuer such that estimated
    fair value generally approximates carrying value. In light of
    recent market conditions, cash and cash equivalent instruments
    have been monitored to ensure there is sufficient demand and
    maintenance of issuer credit quality, or sufficient solvency in
    the case of depository institutions, and the Company has
    determined additional adjustment is not required.

Accrued
    Investment Income

Due to the short term until settlement of accrued investment
    income, the Company believes there is minimal risk of material
    changes in interest rates or credit of the issuer such that
    estimated fair value approximates carrying value. In light of
    recent market conditions, the Company has monitored the credit
    quality of the issuers and has determined additional adjustment
    is not required.

Premiums,
    Reinsurance and Other Receivables

Premiums, reinsurance and other receivables in the preceding
    tables are principally comprised of certain amounts recoverable
    under reinsurance contracts, amounts on deposit with financial
    institutions to facilitate daily settlements related to certain
    derivative positions and amounts receivable for securities sold
    but not yet settled.

Premiums receivable and those amounts recoverable under
    reinsurance treaties determined to transfer sufficient risk are
    not financial instruments subject to disclosure and thus have
    been excluded from the amounts presented in the preceding
    tables. Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts,
    which the Company has determined do not transfer sufficient risk
    such that they are accounted for using the deposit method of
    accounting, have been included in the preceding tables. The
    estimated fair value is determined as the present value of
    expected future cash flows under the related contracts, which
    were discounted using an interest rate determined to reflect the
    appropriate credit standing of the assuming counterparty.

F-132


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements essentially
    represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances and amounts
    due for securities sold are generally received over short
    periods such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying
    value. In light of recent market conditions, the Company has
    monitored the solvency position of the financial institutions
    and has determined additional adjustments are not required.

Other
    Assets

Other assets in the preceding tables is a receivable for cash
    paid to an unaffiliated financial institution under the MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of Charleston (“MRC”) collateral
    financing arrangement as described in Note 12. With the
    exception of the receivable for cash paid to the unaffiliated
    financial institution, other assets are not considered financial
    instruments subject to disclosure. Accordingly, the amount
    presented in the preceding tables represents the receivable for
    the cash paid to the unaffiliated financial institution under
    the MRC collateral financing arrangement for which the estimated
    fair value was determined by discounting the expected future
    cash flows using a discount rate that reflects the credit rating
    of the unaffiliated financial institution.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

Policyholder account balances in the tables above include
    investment contracts. Embedded derivatives on investment
    contracts and certain variable annuity guarantees accounted for
    as embedded derivatives are included in this caption in the
    consolidated financial statements but excluded from this caption
    in the tables above as they are separately presented in
    “— Recurring Fair Value Measurements.” The
    remaining difference between the amounts reflected as
    policyholder account balances in the preceding table and those
    recognized in the consolidated balance sheets represents those
    amounts due under contracts that satisfy the definition of
    insurance contracts and are not considered financial instruments.

The investment contracts primarily include certain funding
    agreements, fixed deferred annuities, modified guaranteed
    annuities, fixed term payout annuities and total control
    accounts. The fair values for these investment contracts are
    estimated by discounting best estimate future cash flows using
    current market risk-free interest rates and adding a spread to
    reflect the nonperformance risk in the liability.

Payables
    for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

The estimated fair value for payables for collateral under
    securities loaned and other transactions approximates carrying
    value. The related agreements to loan securities are short-term
    in nature such that the Company believes there is limited risk
    of a material change in market interest rates. Additionally,
    because borrowers are cross-collateralized by the borrowed
    securities, the Company believes no additional consideration for
    changes in nonperformance risk are necessary.

Bank
    Deposits

Due to the frequency of interest rate resets on customer bank
    deposits held in money market accounts, the Company believes
    that there is minimal risk of a material change in interest
    rates such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying
    value. For time deposits, estimated fair values are estimated by
    discounting the expected cash flows to maturity using a discount
    rate based on an average market rate for certificates of deposit
    being offered by a representative group of large financial
    institutions at the date of the valuation.

Short-term
    and Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing Arrangements and Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities

The estimated fair value for short-term debt approximates
    carrying value due to the short-term nature of these
    obligations. The estimated fair values of long-term debt,
    collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt
    securities are generally determined by discounting expected
    future cash flows using market rates currently available for
    debt with similar remaining maturities and reflecting the credit
    risk of the Company, including inputs

F-133


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

when available, from actively traded debt of the Company or
    other companies with similar types of borrowing arrangements.
    Risk-adjusted discount rates applied to the expected future cash
    flows can vary significantly based upon the specific terms of
    each individual arrangement, including, but not limited to:
    subordinated rights; contractual interest rates in relation to
    current market rates; the structuring of the arrangement; and
    the nature and observability of the applicable valuation inputs.
    Use of different risk-adjusted discount rates could result in
    different estimated fair values.

The carrying value of long-term debt presented in the table
    above differs from the amounts presented in the consolidated
    balance sheets as it does not include capital leases which are
    not required to be disclosed at estimated fair value.

Other
    Liabilities

Other liabilities included in the tables above reflect those
    other liabilities that satisfy the definition of financial
    instruments subject to disclosure. These items consist primarily
    of interest and dividends payable; amounts due for securities
    purchased but not yet settled; and amounts payable under certain
    assumed reinsurance treaties accounted for as deposit type
    treaties. The Company evaluates the specific terms, facts and
    circumstances of each instrument to determine the appropriate
    estimated fair values, which were not materially different from
    the carrying values.

Separate
    Account Liabilities

Separate account liabilities included in the preceding tables
    represent those balances due to policyholders under contracts
    that are classified as investment contracts. The remaining
    amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets represent
    those contracts classified as insurance contracts, which do not
    satisfy the definition of financial instruments.

Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts
    primarily represent variable annuities with no significant
    mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is
    equal to the account balance; funding agreements related to
    group life contracts; and certain contracts that provide for
    benefit funding.

Separate account liabilities are recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets at an equivalent value of the related separate
    account assets. Separate account assets, which equal net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    investment gains and losses, are fully offset by corresponding
    amounts credited to the contractholders’ liability which is
    reflected in separate account liabilities. Since separate
    account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the
    separate account assets which are recognized at estimated fair
    value as described in the section “— Recurring
    Fair Value Measurements,” the Company believes the value of
    those assets approximates the estimated fair value of the
    related separate account liabilities.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments and Commitments to Fund Bank Credit
    Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond
    Investments

The estimated fair values for mortgage loan commitments that
    will be held for investment and commitments to fund bank credit
    facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bonds that will
    be held for investment reflected in the above tables represent
    the difference between the discounted expected future cash flows
    using interest rates that incorporate current credit risk for
    similar instruments on the reporting date and the principal
    amounts of the commitments.

As described in more detail in Note 1, the Company
    performed its annual goodwill impairment tests during the third
    quarter of 2010 based upon data at June 30, 2010. The tests
    indicated that goodwill was not impaired.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that

Separate
    Accounts

Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories
    of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling
    $149.2 billion and $121.4 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, for which the policyholder assumes
    all investment risk, and separate accounts for which the Company
    contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account
    value to the policyholder which totaled $34.1 billion and
    $27.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The latter category consisted primarily of funding
    agreements and participating close-out contracts. The average
    interest rate credited on these contracts was 3.32% and 3.35% at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company (including
    mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender
    charges) are reflected in the Company’s revenues as
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and
    totaled $3.2 billion, $2.6 billion and
    $3.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Obligations
    Under Funding Agreements

The Company issues fixed and floating rate funding agreements,
    which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign
    currencies, to certain SPEs that have issued either debt
    securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and
    principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    issued $34.1 billion, $28.6 billion and
    $20.9 billion, respectively, and repaid $30.9 billion,
    $32.0 billion and $19.8 billion, respectively, of such
    funding agreements. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, funding
    agreements outstanding, which are included in policyholder
    account balances, were $27.2 billion and
    $23.3 billion, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest credited on the

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”) is a
    member of the FHLB of Boston and held $70 million of common
    stock of the FHLB of Boston at both December 31, 2010 and
    2009, which is included in equity securities. MICC has also
    entered into funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston in
    exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of Boston has been
    granted a blanket lien on certain MICC assets, including RMBS,
    to collateralize MICC’s obligations under the funding
    agreements. MICC maintains control over these pledged assets,
    and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of
    the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the
    remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the
    collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MICC,
    the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the collateral is limited
    to the amount of MICC’s liability to the FHLB of Boston.
    The amount of MICC’s liability for funding agreements with
    the FHLB of Boston was $100 million and $326 million
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is
    included in policyholder account balances. The advances on these
    funding agreements are collateralized by mortgage-backed
    securities with estimated fair values of $211 million and
    $419 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, interest credited on the funding agreements,
    which is included in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances, was $1 million, $6 million and
    $15 million, respectively.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”) is a
    member of the FHLB of NY and held $890 million and
    $742 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which is included
    in equity securities. MLIC has also entered into funding
    agreements with the FHLB of NY in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC
    assets, including RMBS to collateralize MLIC’s obligations
    under the funding agreements. MLIC maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of
    default by MLIC, the FHLB of NY’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MLIC’s liability to
    the FHLB of NY. The amount of the MLIC’s liability for
    funding agreements with the FHLB of NY was $12.6 billion
    and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. The advances on these agreements were collateralized
    by mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $14.2 billion and $15.1 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, interest credited on the
    funding agreements, which is included in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, was $276 million,
    $333 million and $229 million, respectively.

During 2010, MetLife Investors Insurance Company
    (“MLIIC”) and General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”) became members of the Federal Home Loan Bank
    of Des Moines (“FHLB of Des Moines) and each held
    $10 million of common stock of the FHLB of Des Moines at
    December 31, 2010, which is included in equity securities.
    MLIIC and GALIC had no funding agreements with the FHLB of Des
    Moines at December 31, 2010.

MLIC and MICC have each issued funding agreements to certain
    SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of
    interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements,
    and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of
    interest and principal by Farmer Mac, a federally chartered
    instrumentality of the United States. The obligations under
    these funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain
    eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans and may, under
    certain circumstances, be secured by other qualified collateral.
    The amount of the Company’s liability for funding
    agreements issued to such SPEs was $2.8 billion and
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. The obligations under these funding agreements are
    collateralized by designated agricultural real estate mortgage
    loans with estimated fair values of $3.2 billion and
    $2.9 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, interest credited on the funding agreements,
    which is included in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances, was $135 million, $132 million and
    $132 million, respectively.

During 2010, 2009 and 2008, as a result of changes in estimates
    of insured events in the respective prior year, claims and claim
    adjustment expenses associated with prior years decreased by
    $75 million, $152 million and $353 million,
    respectively, due to a reduction in prior year automobile bodily
    injury and homeowners’ severity, reduced loss adjustment
    expenses, improved loss ratio for non-medical health claim
    liabilities and improved claim management.

Guarantees

The Company issues annuity contracts which may include
    contractual guarantees to the contractholder for:
    (i) return of no less than total deposits made to the
    contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
    deposits”); and (ii) the highest contract value on a
    specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following the
    contract anniversary, or total deposits made to the contract
    less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
    (“anniversary contract value” or “minimum
    return”). The Company also issues annuity contracts that
    apply a lower rate of funds deposited if the contractholder
    elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if
    the contractholder elects to annuitize (“two tier
    annuities”). These guarantees include benefits that are
    payable in the event of death, maturity or at annuitization.

The Company also issues universal and variable life contracts
    where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder
    a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed

paid-up

benefit.

Reinsurance

The Company participates in reinsurance activities in order to
    limit losses, minimize exposure to significant risks and provide
    additional capacity for future growth.

For its individual life insurance products, the Company has
    historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess
    of retention basis or a quota share basis. The Company currently
    reinsures 90% of the mortality risk in excess of $1 million
    for most products and reinsures up to 90% of the mortality risk
    for certain other products. In addition to reinsuring mortality
    risk as described above, the Company reinsures other risks, as
    well as specific coverages. Placement of reinsurance is done
    primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis
    for risks with specified characteristics. On a case by case
    basis, the Company may retain up to $20 million per life
    and reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the amount the Company
    retains. The Company evaluates its reinsurance programs
    routinely and may increase or decrease its retention at any time.

For other policies within the Insurance Products segment, the
    Company generally retains most of the risk and only cedes
    particular risks on certain client arrangements.

The Company’s Retirement Products segment reinsures a
    portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in
    connection with its variable annuities. Under these reinsurance
    agreements, the Company pays a reinsurance premium generally
    based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from
    policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or
    accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain
    limitations.

The Company’s Corporate Benefit Funding segment
    periodically engages in reinsurance activities, as considered
    appropriate. The impact of these activities on the financial
    results of this segment has not been significant.

The Company’s Auto & Home segment purchases
    reinsurance to manage its exposure to large losses (primarily
    catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. The
    Company cedes to reinsurers a portion of losses and premiums
    based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance.
    To manage exposure to large property and casualty losses, the
    Company utilizes property catastrophe, casualty and property per
    risk excess of loss agreements.

For its life insurance products within the International
    segment, the Company reinsures, depending on the product, risks
    above the corporate retention limit of up to $5 million to
    external reinsurers on a yearly renewable term basis. The
    Company’s international businesses may also reinsure
    certain risks with external reinsurers depending upon the nature
    of the risk and local regulatory requirements. The
    Company’s International segment reinsures, for selected
    large corporate customers, its group employee benefits or credit
    insurance business with various client-affiliated reinsurance
    companies, covering policies issued to the employees or
    customers of the

F-144


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

clients. Additionally, the Company cedes and assumes risk with
    other insurance companies when either company requires a
    business partner with the appropriate local licensing to issue
    certain types of policies in certain countries. In these cases,
    the assuming company typically underwrites the risks, develops
    the products and assumes most or all of the risk. The
    Company’s International segment also has reinsurance
    agreements in force that reinsure a portion of the living and
    death benefit guarantees issued in connection with its variable
    annuities. Under these agreements, the Company pays reinsurance
    fees associated with the guarantees collected from
    policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or
    accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain
    limitations.

The Company also reinsures, through 100% quota share reinsurance
    agreements, certain long-term care and workers’
    compensation business written by MICC. These are run-off
    businesses which have been included within Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

The Company has exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute
    to significant fluctuations in the Company’s results of
    operations. The Company uses excess of retention and quota share
    reinsurance agreements to provide greater diversification of
    risk and minimize exposure to larger risks. For its
    International segment, the Company currently purchases
    catastrophe coverage to insure risks within certain countries
    deemed by management to be exposed to the greatest catastrophic
    risks.

The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group
    of well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. The Company
    analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in
    disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company monitors
    ratings and evaluates the financial strength of its reinsurers
    by analyzing their financial statements. In addition, the
    reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is
    evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process.
    Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances is evaluated
    based on these analyses. The Company generally secures large
    reinsurance recoverable balances with various forms of
    collateral, including secured trusts, funds withheld accounts
    and irrevocable letters of credit. These reinsurance recoverable
    balances are stated net of allowances for uncollectible
    reinsurance, which at December 31, 2010 and 2009, were
    immaterial.

The Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances
    with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts,
    funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. The
    Company had $5.5 billion and $4.4 billion of unsecured
    unaffiliated reinsurance recoverable balances at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

At December 31, 2010, the Company had $13.1 billion of
    net unaffiliated ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total,
    $10.0 billion, or 76%, were with the Company’s five
    largest unaffiliated ceded reinsurers, including
    $3.6 billion of which were unsecured. At December 31,
    2009, the Company had $11.7 billion of net unaffiliated
    ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total,
    $9.2 billion, or 79%, were with the Company’s five
    largest unaffiliated ceded reinsurers, including
    $3.0 billion of which were unsecured.

The Company has reinsured with an unaffiliated third-party
    reinsurer, 49.25% of the closed block through a modified
    coinsurance agreement. The Company accounts for this agreement
    under the deposit method of accounting. The Company, having the
    right of offset, has offset the modified coinsurance deposit
    with the deposit recoverable.

    are recorded using the deposit method of accounting. The deposit
    assets on ceded reinsurance were $2,530 million and
    $2,564 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The deposit liabilities for assumed reinsurance
    were $47 million and $52 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Closed
    Block

On April 7, 2000 (the “Demutualization Date”),
    MLIC converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock
    life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New
    York Superintendent of Insurance (the
    “Superintendent”) approving MLIC’s plan of
    reorganization, as amended (the “Plan”). On the
    Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the
    benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies
    of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an
    amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which,
    together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in
    the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to
    support obligations and

liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not
    limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain
    expenses and taxes, and to provide for the continuation of
    policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the
    experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and for
    appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and
    projected experience against the experience assumed in the
    then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted
    periodically to give effect to changes in experience.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies
    in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows
    from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and
    other experience related to the closed block are, in the
    aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the
    closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed
    block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less
    than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
    policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts
    assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed
    block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
    If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed
    policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets
    outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in
    effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains
    in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over
    100 years.

The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for
    the participating policies included in the closed block as it
    used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company
    establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that
    will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as
    described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over
    closed block assets at the Demutualization Date (adjusted to
    eliminate the impact of related amounts in accumulated other
    comprehensive income) represents the estimated maximum future
    earnings from the closed block expected to result from
    operations attributed to the closed block after income taxes.
    Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income over the
    period the policies and contracts in the closed block remain
    in-force. Management believes that over time the actual
    cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal
    the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend
    changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in
    existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block
    are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed
    block, the Company will pay the excess of the actual cumulative
    earnings of the closed block over the expected cumulative
    earnings to closed block policyholders as additional
    policyholder dividends unless offset by future unfavorable
    experience of the closed block and, accordingly, will recognize
    only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess
    recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such
    period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are
    less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block,
    the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income.
    However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in
    the future, which would be intended to increase future actual
    earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected
    cumulative earnings.

Experience within the closed block, in particular mortality and
    investment yields, as well as realized and unrealized gains and
    losses, directly impact the policyholder dividend obligation.
    The policyholder dividend obligation increased to
    $876 million at December 31, 2010, from zero at
    December 31, 2009, as a result of recent unrealized gains
    in the closed block. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which
    resides outside of the closed block, is based upon cumulative
    actual and expected earnings within the closed block.
    Accordingly, the Company’s net income continues to be
    sensitive to the actual performance of the closed block.

    $1,405 million in 2011, $1,520 million in 2012,

Advances agreements and capital lease obligations are
    collateralized and rank highest in priority, followed by
    unsecured senior debt which consists of senior notes, fixed rate
    notes and other notes with varying interest rates, followed by
    subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated debt
    securities. Payments of interest and principal on the
    Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other
    obligations at the operating company level and senior to
    obligations at the Holding Company, may be made only with the
    prior approval of the insurance department of the state of
    domicile. Collateral financing arrangements are supported by
    either surplus notes of subsidiaries or financing arrangements
    with the Holding Company and, accordingly, have priority
    consistent with other such obligations.

Certain of the Company’s debt instruments, credit
    facilities and committed facilities contain various
    administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. The
    Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants at both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Senior
    Notes — Senior Debt Securities Underlying Equity
    Units

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition (see
    Note 2) in November 2010, MetLife, Inc. issued to
    ALICO Holdings $3,000 million (estimated fair value of
    $3,011 million) in three series of Debt Securities, which
    constitute a part of the Equity Units more fully described in
    Note 14. The Debt Securities (Series C, D and
    E) are subject to remarketing, initially bear interest at
    1.56%, 1.92% and 2.46%, respectively (an average rate of 1.98%),
    and carry initial maturity dates of June 15, 2023,
    June 15, 2024 and June 15, 2045, respectively. The
    interest rates will be reset in connection with the successful
    remarketings of the Debt Securities. Prior to the first
    scheduled attempted remarketing of the Series C Debt
    Securities, such Debt Securities will be divided into two
    tranches equal in principal amount with maturity dates of
    June 15, 2018 and June 15, 2023. Prior to the first
    scheduled attempted remarketing of the Series E Debt
    Securities, such Debt Securities will be divided into two
    tranches equal in principal amount with maturity dates of
    June 15, 2018 and June 15, 2045.

    existing $1,035 million 4.82% Series A junior
    subordinated debt securities as 6.817% senior debt
    securities, Series A, due 2018. Interest on both series of
    debt securities is payable semiannually. The Series A and
    Series B junior subordinated debt securities were
    originally issued in 2005 in connection with certain common
    equity units. See Notes 13 and 14.

Advances
    from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and held
    $187 million and $124 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also
    entered into advances agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MetLife Bank has received cash advances and under which the FHLB
    of NY has been granted a blanket lien on certain of MetLife
    Bank’s residential mortgage loans, mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MetLife Bank’s repayment obligations. Upon
    any event of default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s
    recovery is limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s
    liability under the advances agreements. The amount of MetLife
    Bank’s liability for advances from the FHLB of NY was
    $3.8 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively, which is included in long-term debt
    and short-term debt depending upon the original tenor of the
    advance. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, MetLife Bank received advances related to long-term
    borrowings totaling $2,103 million, $1,280 million and

    no liability for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The estimated fair
    value of loan and investment security collateral pledged by
    MetLife Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $1.8 billion and
    $1.5 billion, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the weighted average interest
    rate on these advances was 0.26% and 0.79%, respectively. During
    the year ended December 31, 2009, the average daily balance

Collateral
    Financing Arrangements

Associated
    with the Closed Block

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In
    connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors
    placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,
    $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of

35-year

surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the
    assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make
    interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is
    contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval. At both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the amount of the surplus notes
    outstanding was $2.5 billion.

Simultaneous with the issuance of the surplus notes, the Holding
    Company entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated
    financial institution, under which the Holding Company is
    entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below. The Holding Company may also be required to
    pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value
    of the surplus notes. Any such payments would be accounted for
    as a receivable and included in other assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets and would not reduce
    the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such
    payments would, however, reduce the amount of interest payments
    due from the Holding Company under the agreement. Any payment
    received from the unaffiliated financial institution would
    reduce the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and
    would also increase the amount of interest payments due from the
    Holding Company under the agreement. In addition, the
    unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge
    collateral to the Holding Company related to any increase in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. During 2008, the
    Holding Company paid an aggregate of $800 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution relating to declines in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. The Holding Company
    did not receive any payments from the unaffiliated financial
    institution during 2008. During 2009, on a net basis, the
    Holding Company received $375 million from the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to changes in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. No payments were made or received by
    the Holding Company during 2010. Since the closing of the
    collateral financing arrangement in December 2007, on a net
    basis, the Holding Company has paid $425 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution related to changes in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. In addition, at
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company had pledged
    collateral with an estimated fair value of $230 million to
    the unaffiliated financial institution. At December 31,
    2009, the Holding Company had no collateral pledged to the
    unaffiliated financial institution in connection with this
    agreement. At December 31, 2010, the Holding Company had
    pledged collateral with an estimated fair value of
    $49 million to the unaffiliated financial institution. The
    Holding Company may also be required to make a payment to the
    unaffiliated financial institution in connection with any early
    termination of this agreement.

A majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus
    notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the
    Company, to support MRC’s statutory obligations associated
    with the assumed closed block liabilities. During 2007, MRC
    deposited $2.0 billion into the trust, from the proceeds of
    the surplus notes issued in 2007. During 2008, MRC deposited an
    additional $314 million into the trust. No amount was
    deposited into the trust during 2009. During 2010, MRC
    transferred $497 million out of the trust. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the estimated fair value of
    assets held in trust by the Company was $2.0 billion and
    $2.4 billion, respectively. The assets are principally
    invested in fixed maturity securities and are presented as such
    within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with the
    related income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest
    on the collateral financing arrangement is included as a
    component of other expenses.

Total interest expense related to the collateral financing
    arrangement was $36 million, $51 million and
    $117 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Associated
    with Secondary Guarantees

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MRSC, a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of the Company, entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, $2.8 billion had
    been drawn upon under the collateral financing arrangement. The
    collateral financing arrangement may be extended by agreement of
    the Holding Company and the unaffiliated financial institution
    on each anniversary of the closing.

Proceeds from the collateral financing arrangement were placed
    in trusts to support MRSC’s statutory obligations
    associated with the reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The
    trusts are VIEs which are consolidated by the Company. The
    unaffiliated financial institution is entitled to the return on
    the investment portfolio held by the trusts. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company held assets in
    trust with an estimated fair value of $3.3 billion and
    $3.2 billion, respectively, associated with the collateral
    financing arrangement. The assets are principally invested in
    fixed maturity securities and are presented as such within the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with the related
    income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest
    on the collateral financing arrangement is included as a
    component of other expenses.

In connection with the collateral financing arrangement, the
    Holding Company entered into an agreement with the same
    unaffiliated financial institution under which the Holding
    Company is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio
    held by the trusts established in connection with this
    collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of
    a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The collateral financing
    agreement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing. The Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit
    into the trusts, related to any decline in the estimated fair
    value of the assets held by the trusts, as well as amounts
    outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the collateral
    financing arrangement. During 2010, no payments were made or
    received by the Holding Company. During 2009 and 2008, the
    Holding Company contributed $360 million and
    $320 million, respectively, as a result of declines in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in the trusts. Cumulatively,
    since May 2007, the Holding Company has contributed a total of
    $680 million as a result of declines in the estimated fair
    value of the assets in the trusts, all of which was deposited
    into the trusts.

In addition, the Holding Company may be required to pledge
    collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this
    agreement. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Holding
    Company had pledged $63 million and $80 million,
    respectively, under the agreement.

Transaction costs associated with the collateral financing
    arrangement of $5 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and are being amortized over the
    period from May 2007, the date the Holding Company entered into
    the collateral financing arrangement, to its expiration. Total
    interest expense related to the collateral financing arrangement
    was $30 million, $44 million and $107 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

In connection with each of the securities described above, the
    Holding Company may redeem or may cause the redemption of the
    securities (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    the date five years prior to the scheduled redemption date at
    their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
    excluding, the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain
    circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to the date five years
    prior to the scheduled redemption date at their principal amount
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. The Holding
    Company also has the right to, and in certain circumstances the
    requirement to, defer interest payments on the securities for a
    period up to ten years. Interest compounds during such periods
    of deferral. If interest is deferred for more than five
    consecutive years, the Holding Company is required to use
    proceeds from the sale of its common stock or warrants on common
    stock to satisfy interest payment obligation. In connection with
    each of the securities described above, the Holding Company
    entered into a replacement capital covenant (“RCC”).
    As part of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not
    repay, redeem, or purchase the securities on or before a date
    ten years prior to the final maturity date of each issuance,
    unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds
    during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the securities due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the securities and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of the Holding
    Company’s indebtedness (which will initially be its
    5.70% senior notes due June 2035). The Holding Company also
    entered into a replacement capital obligation which will
    commence during the six month period prior to the scheduled
    redemption date and under which the Holding Company must use
    reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital to
    permit repayment of the securities through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities.

Issuance costs associated with the issuance of the securities of
    $5 million and $8 million were incurred during the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    issuance costs have been capitalized, are

included in other assets, and are amortized over the period from
    the issuance date until the scheduled redemption date of the
    respective issuances. Interest expense on outstanding junior
    subordinated debt securities was $258 million,
    $231 million and $186 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities Underlying Common Equity
    Units

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued $1,067 million
    4.82% Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B
    junior subordinated debt securities due no later than February
    2039 and February 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $64 million in trust
    common securities of MetLife Capital Trust II
    (“Series A Trust”) and MetLife Capital
    Trust III (“Series B Trust”) and, together
    with the Series A Trust, (the “Capital Trusts”),
    both subsidiary trusts of MetLife, Inc., and $2,070 million
    in aggregate cash proceeds from the sale by the subsidiary
    trusts of trust preferred securities, constituting part of the
    common equity units. The subsidiary trusts each issued
    $1,035 million of trust preferred securities and
    $32 million of trust common securities.

In August 2008, the Series A Trust was dissolved and
    $32 million of the Series A junior subordinated debt
    securities were returned to the Holding Company concurrently
    with the cancellation of the $32 million of trust common
    securities of the Series A Trust held by MetLife, Inc. Upon
    dissolution of the Series A Trust, the remaining
    $1,035 million of Series A junior subordinated debt
    securities were distributed to the holders of the trust
    preferred securities and such trust preferred securities were
    cancelled. In connection with the remarketing transaction in
    August 2008, the remaining $1,035 million of MetLife, Inc.
    Series A junior subordinated debt securities were modified,
    as permitted by their terms, to be 6.817% senior debt
    securities, Series A, due August 2018. The Company did not
    receive any proceeds from the remarketing. See also
    Notes 11, 14 and 18.

In February 2009, the Series B Trust was dissolved and
    $32 million of the Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities were returned to the Holding Company concurrently
    with the cancellation of the $32 million of trust common
    securities of the Series B Trust held by MetLife, Inc. Upon
    dissolution of the Series B Trust, the remaining
    $1,035 million of Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities were distributed to the holders of the trust
    preferred securities and such trust preferred securities were
    cancelled. In connection with the remarketing transaction in
    February 2009, the remaining $1,035 million of MetLife,
    Inc. Series B junior subordinated debt securities were
    modified, as permitted by their terms, to be 7.717% senior
    debt securities, Series B, due February 2019. The Company
    did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. See also
    Notes 11, 14 and 18.

Interest expense on the junior subordinated debt securities
    underlying the common equity units was $6 million and
    $84 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. There was no interest expense on the junior
    subordinated debt securities underlying the common equity units
    for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Common
    Equity Units

Acquisition
    of ALICO

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition (see
    Note 2) in November 2010, MetLife, Inc. issued to
    ALICO Holdings 40.0 million Equity Units with an aggregate
    stated amount at issuance of $3,000 million and an
    estimated fair value of $3,189 million. Each Equity Unit
    has an initial stated amount of $75 per unit and initially
    consists of: (i) three Purchase Contracts, each of which
    obligates the holder to purchase, on a subsequent settlement
    date, a variable number of shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock,
    par value $0.01 per share, for a purchase price of $25 ($75 in
    the aggregate); and (ii) a


/


undivided beneficial ownership interest in each of three series
    of Debt Securities issued by MetLife, Inc., each series of Debt
    Securities having an aggregate principal amount of
    $1,000 million. Distributions on the Equity Units will be
    made quarterly, and will consist of contract payments on the
    Purchase Contracts and interest payments on the Debt Securities,
    at an aggregate annual rate of 5.00% of the stated amount at any
    time. The excess of the estimated fair value of the Equity Units
    over the estimated fair value of the Debt Securities (see
    Note 11), after accounting for the present value of future
    contract payments recorded in

F-158


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

other liabilities, results in a net decrease to additional
    paid-in capital of $69 million, representing the fair value
    of the Purchase Contracts discussed below.

The Equity Units, the Debt Securities and the common stock
    issuable upon settlement of the Purchase Contracts are subject
    to the terms of an investor rights agreement entered into among
    MetLife, Inc., AIG and ALICO Holdings, which grants to ALICO
    Holdings certain rights and sets forth certain agreements with
    respect to ALICO Holdings’ ownership, voting and transfer
    of the shares, including minimum holding periods, restrictions
    on the number of shares ALICO Holdings can sell at one time, its
    agreement to vote the common stock in the same proportion as the
    common stock voted by all other holders and its agreement not to
    seek control or influence the Company’s management or Board
    of Directors. The Equity Units are not listed on any exchange or
    inter-dealer quotation system. The Equity Units have been
    pledged to secure certain indemnification obligations of ALICO
    Holdings under the Stock Purchase Agreement. See Note 2.

Purchase
    Contracts

Settlement of the Purchase Contracts of each series will occur
    upon the successful remarketing of the related series of Debt
    Securities, or upon a final failed remarketing of the related
    series, as described below under “— Debt
    Securities.” On each settlement date subsequent to a
    successful remarketing, the holder will pay $25 per Equity Unit
    and MetLife, Inc. will issue to such holder a variable number of
    shares of its common stock in settlement of the applicable
    Purchase Contract. The number of shares to be issued will depend
    on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of
    MetLife, Inc.’s common stock during the 20 trading day
    periods ending on, and including, the third day prior to the
    initial scheduled settlement date for each series of Purchase
    Contracts. The initially-scheduled settlement dates are
    October 10, 2012 for the Series C Purchase Contracts,
    September 11, 2013 for the Series D Purchase Contracts
    and October 8, 2014 for the Series E Purchase
    Contracts. If the average value of MetLife, Inc.’s common
    stock as calculated pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement
    during the applicable 20 trading day period is less than or
    equal to $35.42, as such amount may be adjusted (the
    “Reference Price”), the number of shares to be issued
    in settlement of the Purchase Contract will equal $25 divided by
    the Reference Price, as calculated pursuant to the Stock
    Purchase Agreement (the “Maximum Settlement Rate”). If
    the market value of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock is greater
    than or equal to $44.275, as such amount may be adjusted (the
    “Threshold Appreciation Price”), the number of shares
    to be issued in settlement of the Purchase Contract will equal
    $25 divided by the Threshold Appreciation Price, as so
    calculated (the “Minimum Settlement Rate”). If the
    market value of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock is greater
    than the Reference Price and less than the Threshold
    Appreciation Price, the number of shares to be issued will equal
    $25 divided by the applicable market value, as so calculated. In
    the event of an unsuccessful remarketing of any series of Debt
    Securities and the postponement of settlement to a later date,
    the average market value used to calculate the settlement rate
    for a particular series will not be recalculated, although
    certain corporate events may require adjustments to the
    settlement rate. After settlement of all the Purchase Contracts,
    MetLife, Inc. will receive proceeds of $3,000 million and
    issue between 67.8 million and 84.7 million shares of
    its common stock, subject to certain adjustments. The holder of
    an Equity Unit may, at its option, settle the related Purchase
    Contracts before the applicable settlement date. However, upon
    early settlement, the holder will receive the Minimum Settlement
    Rate.

Distributions on the Purchase Contracts will be made quarterly
    at an average annual rate of 3.02%. The value of the Purchase
    Contracts at issuance of $247 million was calculated as the
    present value of the future contract payments and was recorded
    in other liabilities with an offsetting decrease in additional
    paid-in capital. The other liabilities balance will be reduced
    as contract payments are made. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, no contract payments were made.

Debt
    Securities

The Debt Securities are senior, unsecured notes of MetLife, Inc.
    which, in the aggregate, pay quarterly distributions at an
    initial average annual rate of 1.98% and are included in
    long-term debt (see Note 11 for further

F-159


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

discussion of terms). The Debt Securities will be initially
    pledged as collateral to secure the obligations of each Equity
    Unit holder under the related Purchase Contracts. Each series of
    the Debt Securities will be subject to a remarketing and sold on
    behalf of participating holders to investors. The proceeds of a
    remarketing, net of any related fees, will be applied on behalf
    of participating holders who so elect to settle any obligation
    of the holder to pay cash under the related Purchase Contract on
    the applicable settlement dates. The initially-scheduled
    remarketing dates are October 10, 2012 for the
    Series C Debt Securities, September 11, 2013 for the
    Series D Debt Securities and October 8, 2014 for the
    Series E Debt Securities, subject to delay if there are one
    or more unsuccessful remarketings. If the initial attempted
    remarketing of a series is unsuccessful, up to two additional
    remarketing attempts will occur. At the remarketing date, the
    remarketing agent may reset the interest rate on the Debt
    Securities, subject to a reset cap for each of the first two
    attempted remarketings of each series. If a remarketing is
    successful, the reset rate will apply to all outstanding Debt
    Securities of the applicable tranche of the remarketed series,
    whether or not the holder participated in the remarketing and
    will become effective on the settlement date of such
    remarketing. If the first remarketing attempt with respect to a
    series is unsuccessful, the applicable Purchase Contract
    settlement date will be delayed for three calendar months, at
    which time a second remarketing attempt will occur in connection
    with settlement. If the second remarketing attempt is
    unsuccessful, one additional delay may occur on the same basis.
    If both additional remarketing attempts are unsuccessful, a
    “final failed remarketing” will have occurred, and the
    interest rate on such series of Debt Securities will not be
    reset and the holder may put such series of Debt Securities to
    MetLife, Inc. at a price equal to its principal amount plus
    accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and apply the principal
    amount against the holder’s obligations under the related
    Purchase Contract.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

The treasury stock method is used to determine the potential
    dilution of the Purchase Contracts on earnings per common share.
    There was no dilution associated with the Purchase Contracts for
    the year ended December 31, 2010.

Acquisition
    of The Travelers Insurance Company

In connection with financing the acquisition of The Travelers
    Insurance Company on July 1, 2005, the Holding Company
    distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375% common equity
    units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a registered public
    offering on June 21, 2005. The common equity units
    consisted of interests in trust preferred securities issued by
    MetLife Capital Trusts II and III, and stock purchase
    contracts issued by the Holding Company. The only assets of
    MetLife Capital Trusts II and III were junior
    subordinated debt securities issued by the Holding Company. The
    common equity units ceased to exist upon the closing of the
    remarketing of the underlying debt instruments and the
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts in August 2008 and
    February 2009. See Notes 13 and 18.

    valuation allowance reflects management’s assessment, based
    on available information, that it is more likely than not that
    the deferred income tax asset for certain foreign net operating
    and capital loss carryforwards and certain foreign unrealized
    losses will not be realized. The tax benefit will be recognized
    when management believes that it is more likely than not that
    these deferred income tax assets are realizable. In 2010, the
    Company recorded an overall increase to the deferred tax
    valuation allowance of $44 million, comprised of a decrease
    of $2 million related to certain foreign unrealized losses,
    an increase of $18 million related to certain foreign
    capital loss carryforwards, an increase of $28 million
    related to certain state and foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards.

The Company has not provided U.S. deferred taxes on
    cumulative earnings of certain

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely.
    These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have

    Statements — (Continued)

been reinvested in active

non-U.S. business

operations. The Company does not intend to repatriate these
    earnings to fund U.S. operations. Deferred taxes are
    provided for earnings of

non-U.S. affiliates

and associated companies when the Company plans to remit those
    earnings. At December 31, 2010, the Company has not made a
    provision for U.S. taxes on approximately
    $1,045 million of the excess of the amount for financial
    reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign
    subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. It is
    not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability
    related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.

The Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal
    government and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as
    foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous
    examination by the IRS and other tax authorities in
    jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business
    operations. The income tax years under examination vary by
    jurisdiction. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer
    subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or foreign income
    tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2000. In
    early 2009, the Company and the IRS completed and substantially
    settled the audit years of 2000 to 2002. A few issues not
    settled have been escalated to the next level, IRS Appeals. In
    April 2010, the IRS exam of the current audit cycle, years 2003
    to 2006 began.

The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    decrease in the next 12 months pending the outcome of
    remaining issues, tax-exempt income and tax credits associated
    with the 2000 to 2002 IRS audit. A reasonable estimate of the
    decrease cannot be made at this time. However, the Company
    continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of the issues
    will not result in a material change to its consolidated
    financial statements, although the resolution of income tax
    matters could impact the Company’s effective tax rate for a
    particular future period.

The Company classifies interest accrued related to unrecognized
    tax benefits in interest expense, included within other
    expenses, while penalties are included in income tax expense.

At December 31, 2010, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $810 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $536 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by
    $37 million from December 31, 2009 primarily due to
    increases for tax positions of prior years offset by reductions
    for tax positions of prior years and settlements reached with
    the IRS. The increases for tax positions of prior years included
    $169 million from the acquisition of American Life.
    Settlements with tax authorities amounted to $59 million,
    all of which was reclassified to current and deferred income tax
    payable, as applicable, with $3 million paid in 2010.

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $773 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $583 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by
    $7 million from December 31, 2008 primarily due to
    additions for tax positions of the current and prior years
    offset by settlements reached with the IRS. Settlements with tax
    authorities amounted to $46 million, of which
    $44 million was reclassified to current income tax payable
    and paid in 2009 and $2 million reduced current income tax
    expense.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $766 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $567 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $74 million from December 31, 2007 primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, leasing and tax
    credits offset by additions for tax positions of the current
    year. As a result of the settlements, items within the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, in the amount of
    $153 million, were reclassified to current and deferred
    income tax payable, as applicable, of which $20 million was
    paid in 2008 and $133 million was paid in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
    recognized $39 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2010, the Company had $221 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $23 million increase from
    December 31, 2009 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted primarily from
    an increase of $20 million from the acquisition of American
    Life, along with an increase of $39 million of interest
    expense and a $36 million decrease primarily resulting from
    the aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $36 million
    decrease, $18 million has been reclassified to current
    income tax payable, of which $2 million was paid in 2010.
    The remaining $18 million reduced interest expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recognized $44 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had $198 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $22 million increase from
    December 31, 2008 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an
    increase of $44 million of interest expense and a
    $22 million decrease primarily resulting from the
    aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $22 million
    decrease, $20 million was reclassified to current income
    tax payable and was paid in 2009. The remaining $2 million
    reduced interest expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $37 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had $176 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $42 million decrease from
    December 31, 2007 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an
    increase of $37 million of interest expense and a
    $79 million decrease primarily resulting from the
    aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $79 million
    decrease, $78 million was reclassified to current income
    tax payable in 2008, with $7 million and $71 million
    paid in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The remaining
    $1 million reduced interest expense.

The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have indicated
    that they intend to address through regulations the methodology
    to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction
    (“DRD”), related to variable life insurance and
    annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income
    subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference
    between the actual tax expense and expected amount determined
    using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. Any regulations
    that the IRS ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will
    be subject to public notice and comment, at which time insurance
    companies and other interested parties will have the opportunity
    to raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope
    and application of such regulations. As a result, the ultimate
    timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown at this
    time. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company recognized an income tax benefit of $87 million and
    $216 million, respectively, related to the separate account
    DRD. The 2010 benefit included an expense of $57 million
    related to a

Contingencies,
    Commitments and Guarantees

Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain.
    Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate
    documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of
    witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply
    the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented,
    whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. The review includes senior legal and financial
    personnel. Estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are established when
    it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of the matters noted below. It is
    possible that some of the matters could require the Company to
    pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in
    amounts that could not be estimated at December 31, 2010.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups
    of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.

F-165

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs— it had no special relationship
    with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute
    or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs;
    (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC;
    (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the cause of the
    plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure
    occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and
    (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has
    expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial
    courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC,
    while other trial courts have denied MLIC’s motions to
    dismiss. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive
    favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases
    brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend
    aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure,
    including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the
    year in connection with settlements made in that year and in
    prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’
    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.

In 2007, MLIC received approximately 7,161 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 79,717 claims, and paid
    approximately $28.2 million for settlements reached in 2007
    and prior years. In 2006, MLIC received approximately 7,870 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 87,070
    claims, and paid approximately $35.5 million for
    settlements reached in 2006 and prior years. In 2005, MLIC
    received approximately 18,500 new claims, ending the year with a
    total of approximately 100,250 claims, and paid approximately
    $74.3 million for settlements reached in 2005 and prior
    years. In 2004, MLIC received approximately 23,900 new claims,
    ending the year with a total of approximately 108,000 claims,
    and paid approximately $85.5 million for settlements
    reached in 2004 and prior years. In 2003, MLIC received
    approximately 58,750 new claims, ending the year with a total of
    approximately 111,700 claims, and paid approximately
    $84.2 million for settlements reached in 2003 and prior
    years. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the
    dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of
    any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims

F-166


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently
    accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary.
    While the potential future charges could be material in the
    particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are
    recorded, based on information currently known by management,
    management does not believe any such charges are likely to have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provided for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion in excess of a
    $400 million self-insured retention. The Company’s
    initial option to commute the excess insurance policies for
    asbestos-related claims would have arisen at the end of 2008. On
    September 29, 2008, MLIC entered into agreements commuting
    the excess insurance policies at September 30, 2008. As a
    result of the commutation of the policies, MLIC received cash
    and securities totaling $632 million. Of this total, MLIC
    received $115 million in fixed maturity securities on
    September 26, 2008, $200 million in cash on
    October 29, 2008, and $317 million in cash on
    January 29, 2009. MLIC recognized a loss on commutation of
    the policies in the amount of $35.3 million during 2008.

In the years prior to commutation, the excess insurance policies
    for asbestos-related claims were subject to annual and per claim
    sublimits. Amounts exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were approximately $16 million, $8 million and
    $0, respectively. Amounts were recoverable under the policies
    annually with respect to claims paid during the prior calendar
    year. Each asbestos-related policy contained an experience fund
    and a reference fund that provided for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund was greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund was less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund was tied to performance of the
    S&P 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
    A claim with respect to the prior year was made under the excess
    insurance policies in each year from 2003 through 2008 for the
    amounts paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of
    the retention. The foregone loss reimbursements were
    approximately $62.2 million with respect to claims for the
    period of 2002 through 2007. Because the policies were commuted
    at September 30, 2008, there will be no claims under the
    policies or forgone loss reimbursements with respect to payments
    made in 2008 and thereafter.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its
    past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are
    reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal
    defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant
    assumptions underlying MLIC’s analysis of the adequacy of
    its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation
    include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the
    cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its
    exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its
    liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through
    December 31, 2010.

Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (“FINRA”) seeking a broad range of information. The
    issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters
    vary widely. The Company cooperates in these inquiries.

Attorneys general from 50 states and several state banking
    and mortgage regulators announced a multistate joint
    investigation of mortgage servicers to determine whether
    inaccurate affidavits or other documents were submitted in
    support of foreclosure proceedings. MetLife Bank, and
    specifically its mortgage servicing department within MetLife
    Home Loans, received requests for information from some of these
    state attorneys general and other regulators. Also, the Acting
    Comptroller of the Currency disclosed in testimony before
    Congress that 14 mortgage servicing businesses affiliated with
    banking organizations, including that of MetLife Bank, have been
    the subject of an intra-agency confidential “horizontal
    examination” of mortgage servicing and foreclosure
    activities. The Acting Comptroller also testified that federal
    banking regulators expect to issue administrative enforcement
    orders to such businesses and to seek civil money penalties. The
    Acting Comptroller’s testimony also indicated that other
    federal agencies, including the Department of Justice and the
    Federal Trade Commission, were examining potential actions with
    respect to such businesses. MetLife is cooperating with its
    regulators in connection with their review of these matters but
    cannot predict the outcome of these matters. It is possible that
    additional state or federal regulators or legislative bodies may
    pursue similar investigations or make related inquiries.
    Management believes that the Company’s financial statements
    as a whole will not be materially affected by the MetLife Bank
    regulatory matters.

United States of America v. EME Homer City Generation,
    L.P., et al. (W.D. Pa., filed January 4,
    2011).

On January 4, 2011, the United States
    commenced a civil action in United States District Court for the
    Western District of Pennsylvania against EME Homer City
    Generation L.P. (“EME Homer City”), Homer City OL6
    LLC, and other defendants regarding the operations of the Homer
    City Generating Station, an electricity generating facility.
    Homer City OL6 LLC, an entity owned by MLIC, is a passive
    investor with a noncontrolling interest in the electricity
    generating facility, which is solely operated by the lessee, EME
    Homer City. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and assessment
    of civil penalties for alleged violations of the federal Clean
    Air Act and Pennsylvania’s State Implementation Plan. The
    alleged violations were the subject of Notices of Violations
    (“NOVs”) that the Environmental Protection Agency
    (“EPA”) issued to EME Homer City, Homer City OL6 LLC,
    and others in June 2008 and May 2010. On January 7, 2011,
    the United States District Court for the Western District of
    Pennsylvania granted the motion by the Pennsylvania Department
    of Environmental Protection and the State of New York to
    intervene in the lawsuit as additional plaintiffs. On
    January 7, 2011, two plaintiffs filed a putative class
    action titled

Scott Jackson and Maria Jackson v. EME
    Homer City Generation L.P., et. al.

in the United States
    District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on
    behalf of a putative class of persons who have allegedly
    incurred damage to their persons

and/or

property because of the violations alleged in the action brought
    by the United States. Homer City OL6 LLC is a defendant in this
    action. EME Homer City has acknowledged its obligation to
    indemnify Homer City OL6 LLC for any claims relating to the NOVs.

In the Matter of Chemform, Inc. Site, Pompano Beach, Broward
    County, Florida.

In July 2010, the EPA advised
    MLIC that it believed payments were due under two settlement
    agreements, known as “Administrative Orders on
    Consent,” that New England Mutual Life Insurance Company
    (“New England Mutual”) signed in 1989 and 1992 with
    respect to the cleanup of a Superfund site in Florida (the
    “Chemform Site”). The EPA originally contacted MLIC
    (as successor to New England Mutual) and a third party in 2001,
    and advised that they owed additional

clean-up

costs for the Chemform Site. The matter was not resolved at that
    time. The EPA is requesting payment of an amount under
    $1 million from MLIC and a third party for past costs and
    for future environmental testing costs at the Chemform Site.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states and FINRA,
    and occasionally the SEC, have had investigations or inquiries
    relating to sales of individual life insurance policies or
    annuities or other products

by MLIC, MICC, New England Life Insurance Company and GALIC, and
    the four Company broker-dealers, which are MetLife Securities,
    Inc. (“MSI”), New England Securities Corporation,
    Walnut Street Securities, Inc. and Tower Square Securities, Inc.
    These investigations often focus on the conduct of particular
    financial services representatives and the sale of unregistered
    or unsuitable products or the misuse of client assets. Over the
    past several years, these and a number of investigations by
    other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments
    and certain other relief, including restitution payments. The
    Company may continue to resolve investigations in a similar
    manner. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in
    its consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for these sales practices-related
    investigations or inquiries.

Retained
    Asset Account Matters

The New York Attorney General announced on July 29, 2010
    that his office had launched a major fraud investigation into
    the life insurance industry for practices related to the use of
    retained asset accounts as a settlement option for death
    benefits and that subpoenas requesting comprehensive data
    related to retained asset accounts had been served on MetLife
    and other insurance carriers. The Company received the subpoena
    on July 30, 2010. The Company also has received requests
    for documents and information from U.S. congressional
    committees and members as well as various state regulatory
    bodies, including the New York Insurance Department. It is
    possible that other state and federal regulators or legislative
    bodies may pursue similar investigations or make related
    inquiries. Management cannot predict what effect any such
    investigations might have on the Company’s earnings or the
    availability of the Company’s retained asset account known
    as the Total Control Account (“TCA”), but management
    believes that the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole would not be materially affected.
    Management believes that any allegations that information about
    the TCA is not adequately disclosed or that the accounts are
    fraudulent or otherwise violate state or federal laws are
    without merit.

MLIC is a defendant in lawsuits related to the TCA. The lawsuits
    include claims of breach of contract, breach of a common law
    fiduciary duty or a quasi-fiduciary duty such as a confidential
    or special relationship, or breach of a fiduciary duty under the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”).

Clark, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (D.
    Nev., filed March 28, 2008).

This putative
    class action lawsuit alleges breach of contract and breach of a
    common law fiduciary

and/or

quasi-fiduciary duty arising from use of the TCA to pay life
    insurance policy death benefits. As damages, plaintiffs seek
    disgorgement of the difference between the interest paid to the
    account holders and the investment earnings on the assets
    backing the accounts. In March 2009, the court granted in part
    and denied in part MLIC’s motion to dismiss,
    dismissing the fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims but
    allowing a breach of contract claim and a special or
    confidential relationship claim to go forward. On
    September 9, 2010, the court granted MLIC’s motion for
    summary judgment. On September 20, 2010, plaintiff filed a
    Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the
    Ninth Circuit.

Faber, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
    (S.D.N.Y., filed December 4, 2008).

This
    putative class action lawsuit alleges that MLIC’s use of
    the TCA as the settlement option under group life insurance
    policies violates MLIC’s fiduciary duties under ERISA. As
    damages, plaintiffs seek disgorgement of the difference between
    the interest paid to the account holders and the investment
    earnings on the assets backing the accounts. On October 23,
    2009, the court granted MLIC’s motion to dismiss with
    prejudice. On November 24, 2009, plaintiffs filed a Notice
    of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit.

Keife, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company

(D.
    Nev., filed in state court on July 30, 2010 and removed to
    federal court on September 7, 2010). This putative class
    action lawsuit raises a breach of contract claim arising from
    MLIC’s use of the TCA to pay life insurance benefits under
    the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance program. As
    damages, plaintiffs seek disgorgement of the difference between
    the interest paid to the account holders and the investment
    earnings on the assets backing the accounts. In September 2010,
    plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification of the breach
    of contract claim, which the court has stayed. On
    November 22, 2010, MLIC filed a motion to dismiss.

Other
    U.S. Litigation

Travelers Ins. Co., et al. v. Banc of America Securities
    LLC (S.D.N.Y., filed December 13, 2001).

On
    January 6, 2009, after a jury trial

,

the district
    court entered a judgment in favor of The Travelers Insurance
    Company, now known as MICC, in the amount of approximately
    $42 million in connection with securities and common law
    claims against the defendant. On May 14, 2009, the district
    court issued an opinion and order denying the defendant’s
    post judgment motion seeking a judgment in its favor or, in the
    alternative, a new trial. On July 20, 2010, the United
    States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued an order
    affirming the district court’s judgment in favor of MICC
    and the district court’s order denying defendant’s
    post-trial motions. On October 14, 2010, the Second Circuit
    issued an order denying defendant’s petition for rehearing
    of its appeal. On October 20, 2010, the defendant paid MICC
    approximately $42 million, which represents the judgment
    amount due to MICC. This lawsuit is now fully resolved.

Roberts, et al. v. Tishman Speyer Properties, et al.
    (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed January 22, 2007)

. This
    lawsuit was filed by a putative class of market rate tenants at
    Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village against parties
    including Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company
    (“MTL”) and Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity
    Company. Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity Company has merged
    into MTL and no longer exists as a separate entity. These
    tenants claim that MTL, as former owner, and the current owner
    improperly deregulated apartments while receiving J-51 tax
    abatements. The lawsuit seeks declaratory relief and damages for
    rent overcharges. Although the tenants allege over
    $200 million in damages in the complaint, MTL strongly
    disputes the tenants’ damages amounts. In October 2009, the
    New York State Court of Appeals issued an opinion denying
    MTL’s motion to dismiss the complaint. The lawsuit has
    returned to the trial court where MTL continues to vigorously
    defend against the claims. The Company believes adequate
    provision has been made in its consolidated financial statements
    for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for this
    lawsuit. It is reasonably possible that the Company’s total
    exposure may be greater than the liability currently accrued and
    that future charges to income may be necessary. Management
    believes that the Company’s financial statements as a whole
    will not be materially affected by any such future charges.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007).

A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs asserted legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs sought rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. In August 2009, the district
    court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. On
    February 2, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for
    the Tenth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district court
    granting MLIC’s and MSI’s summary judgment motion.

Sales Practices Claims.

Over the past several
    years, the Company has faced numerous claims, including class
    action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of
    individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or
    other products. Some of the current cases seek substantial
    damages, including punitive and treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees. The Company continues to vigorously defend
    against the claims in these matters. The Company believes
    adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial
    statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for
    sales practices matters.

International
    Litigation

Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada v. Metropolitan
    Life Ins. Co. (Super. Ct., Ontario, October
    2006).

In 2006, Sun Life Assurance Company of
    Canada (“Sun Life”), as successor to the purchaser of
    MLIC’s Canadian operations, filed this lawsuit in Toronto,
    seeking a declaration that MLIC remains liable for “market
    conduct claims” related to certain individual life
    insurance policies sold by MLIC and that have been transferred
    to Sun Life. Sun Life had asked that the court require MLIC to
    indemnify Sun Life for these claims pursuant to indemnity
    provisions in the sale agreement for the sale of MLIC’s
    Canadian operations entered into in June of 1998. In January
    2010, the court found that Sun Life had given timely notice of
    its claim for indemnification but, because it found

    Inc.

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

that Sun Life had not yet incurred an indemnifiable loss,
    granted MLIC’s motion for summary judgment. Both parties
    appealed. In September 2010, Sun Life notified MLIC that a
    purported class action lawsuit was filed against Sun Life in
    Toronto,

Kang v. Sun Life Assurance Co. (Super. Ct.,
    Ontario, September 2010)

, alleging sales practices claims
    regarding the same individual policies sold by MLIC and
    transferred to Sun Life. Sun Life contends that MLIC is
    obligated to indemnify Sun Life for some or all of the claims in
    this lawsuit. MLIC is currently not a party to the

Kang v. Sun Life

lawsuit.

Italy Fund Redemption Suspension Complaints and
    Litigation.

As a result of suspension of
    withdrawals and diminution in value in certain funds offered
    within certain unit-linked policies sold by the Italian branch
    of Alico Life International, Ltd. (“ALIL”), a number
    of policyholders invested in those funds have either commenced
    or threatened litigation against ALIL, alleging
    misrepresentation, inadequate disclosures and other related
    claims. These policyholders contacted ALIL beginning in July
    2009 alleging that the funds operated at variance to the
    published prospectus and that prospectus risk disclosures were
    allegedly wrong, unclear, and misleading. The limited number of
    lawsuits that have been filed to date have either been resolved
    or are proceeding through litigation. In March 2010, ALIL
    learned that the public prosecutor in Milan had opened a formal
    investigation into the actions of ALIL employees, as well as of
    employees of ALIL’s major distributor, based upon a
    policyholder complaint. The complaint filed by the policyholder
    has now been withdrawn. ALIL is cooperating with the Italian and
    Irish regulatory authorities, which have jurisdiction in
    connection with this matter. The Stock Purchase Agreement
    includes a provision pursuant to which the Holding Company and
    certain related parties may seek indemnification for liabilities
    in excess of an agreed upon amount arising out of certain
    specified policyholder claims and governmental investigations in
    connection with the above-mentioned unit-linked policies. See
    also “Indemnification Assets and Contingent
    Consideration” in Note 2.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its
    activities as an insurer, mortgage lending bank, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses of all pending
    investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters
    referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax

offsets. In addition, Japan has established a Policyholder
    Protection Commission as a contingency to protect policyholders
    against the insolvency of life insurance companies in Japan
    through assessments to companies licensed to provide life
    insurance.

Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments were as
    follows:

    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Argentina

The Argentine economic, regulatory and legal environment,
    including interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators
    and courts, is uncertain. Potential legal or governmental
    actions related to pension reform, fiduciary responsibilities,
    performance guarantees and tax rulings could adversely affect
    the results of the Company.

In 2007, pension reform legislation in Argentina was enacted
    which relieved the Company of its obligation to provide death
    and disability policy coverages and resulted in the elimination
    of related insurance liabilities. The reform reinstituted the
    government’s pension plan system and allowed for pension
    participants to transfer their future contributions to the
    government pension plan system.

Although it no longer received compensation, the Company
    continued to be responsible for managing the funds of those
    participants that transferred to the government system. This
    change resulted in the establishment of a liability for future
    servicing obligations and the elimination of the Company’s
    obligations under death and disability policy coverages. During
    2008, the future servicing obligation was reduced by
    $23 million, net of income tax, when information regarding
    the level of participation in the government pension plan became
    fully available.

In September 2008, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled against the
    validity of the 2002 Pesification Law enacted by the Argentine
    government. This ruling applied to certain social security
    pension annuity contractholders that had filed a lawsuit against
    the 2002 Pesification Law. The annuity contracts impacted by
    this ruling, which were deemed peso denominated under the 2002
    Pesification Law, are now considered to be U.S. dollar
    denominated obligations of the Company. The applicable
    contingent liabilities were then adjusted and refined to be
    consistent with this ruling. The impact of the refinements
    resulting from the change in these contingent liabilities and
    the associated future policyholder benefits was an increase to
    net income of $34 million, net of income tax, during the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

In October 2008, the Argentine government announced its
    intention to nationalize private pensions and, in December 2008,
    the Argentine government nationalized the private pension system
    seizing the underlying investments of participants which were
    being managed by the Company. With this action, the
    Company’s

F-172


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

pension business in Argentina ceased to exist and the Company
    eliminated certain assets and liabilities held in connection
    with the pension business. Deferred acquisition costs, deferred
    tax assets, and liabilities — primarily the liability
    for future servicing obligation referred to above —
    were eliminated and the Company incurred severance costs
    associated with the termination of employees. The impact of the
    elimination of assets and liabilities and the incurral of
    severance costs was an increase to net income of
    $6 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

In March 2009, in light of market developments resulting from
    the Supreme Court ruling contrary to the Pesification Law and
    the implementation by the Company of a program to allow the
    contractholders that had not filed a lawsuit to convert to
    U.S. dollars the social security annuity contracts
    denominated in pesos by the Pesification Law, the Company
    further reduced the outstanding contingent liabilities by
    $108 million, net of income tax, which was partially offset
    by the establishment of contingent liabilities from the
    implementation of the program to convert these contracts to
    U.S. dollars of $13 million, net of income tax,
    resulting in a decrease to net loss of $95 million, net of
    income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Further governmental or legal actions are possible in Argentina.
    Such actions may impact the level of existing liabilities or may
    create additional obligations or benefits to the Company’s
    operations in Argentina. Management has made its best estimate
    of its obligations based upon information currently available;
    however, further governmental or legal actions could result in
    changes in obligations which could materially impact the amounts
    presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments

Leases

In accordance with industry practice, certain of the
    Company’s income from lease agreements with retail tenants
    are contingent upon the level of the tenants’ revenues.
    Additionally, the Company, as lessee, has entered into various
    lease and sublease agreements for office space, information
    technology and other equipment. Future minimum rental and
    sublease income, and minimum gross rental payments relating to
    these lease agreements are as follows:

During 2008, the Company moved certain of its operations in New
    York from Long Island City, Queens to Manhattan. As a result of
    this movement of operations and current market conditions, which
    precluded the Company’s immediate and complete sublet of
    all unused space in both Long Island City and Manhattan, the
    Company incurred a lease impairment charge of $38 million
    which is included within other expenses in Banking,
    Corporate & Other. The impairment charge was
    determined based upon the present value of the gross rental
    payments less sublease income discounted at a risk-adjusted rate
    over the remaining lease terms which range from

15-20 years.

The Company has made assumptions with respect to the timing and
    amount of future sublease income in the determination of this
    impairment charge. During 2009, pending sublease deals were
    impacted by the further decline of market conditions, which
    resulted in an additional lease impairment charge of
    $52 million. See Note 19

F-173


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

for discussion of $28 million of such charges related to
    restructuring. Additional impairment charges could be incurred
    should market conditions deteriorate further or last for a
    period significantly longer than anticipated.

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded
    commitments were $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
    anticipates that these amounts will be invested in partnerships
    over the next five years.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company intends to sell the
    majority of these originated residential mortgage loans.
    Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans that will
    be

held-for-sale

are considered derivatives and their estimated fair value and
    notional amounts are included within interest rate forwards in
    Note 4.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be

held-for-investment.

The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $2.4 billion and
    $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third-party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $1.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe
    that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    that could become due under these guarantees in the future.
    Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to
    make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees,
    or commitments.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount,

F-174


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine
    the maximum potential amount that could become due under these
    guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company did
    not record any additional liabilities for indemnities,
    guarantees and commitments. The Company’s recorded
    liabilities were $5 million at both December 31, 2010
    and 2009, for indemnities, guarantees and commitments.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits that are primarily
    based upon years of credited service and final average earnings.
    The cash balance formula primarily utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2010, the majority of active participants were
    accruing benefits under the cash balance formula; however,
    approximately 90% of the Subsidiaries’ obligations result
    from benefits calculated with the traditional formula. The
    U.S. non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental
    benefits in excess of limits applicable to a qualified plan.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total costs of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

In connection with the Acquisition, domestic American Life
    employees who became employees of certain Subsidiaries
    (including those who remained employees of companies acquired in
    the Acquisition) were credited with service recognized by AIG
    for purposes of determining eligibility under the pension plans
    with respect to benefits earned under the pension plans
    subsequent to the closing date of the Acquisition.

Additionally, in connection with the Acquisition, the Company
    acquired certain pension plans sponsored by American Life. As of
    the end of the year, these plans had liabilities of
    approximately $595 million and assets of approximately
    $97 million.

Measurement dates used for all of the Subsidiaries’ defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    correspond with the fiscal year ends of sponsoring Subsidiaries,
    which are December 31 for most Subsidiaries and November 30 for
    American Life.

Net periodic pension costs and net periodic other postretirement
    benefit plan costs are comprised of the following:

i)

Service Costs — Service costs are the increase in the
    projected (expected) pension benefit obligation resulting from
    benefits payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service
    rendered during the current year.

ii)

Interest Costs on the Liability — Interest costs are
    the time value adjustment on the projected (expected) pension
    benefit obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Settlement and Curtailment Costs — The aggregate
    amount of net gains (losses) recognized in net periodic benefit
    costs due to settlements and curtailments. Settlements result
    from actions that relieve/eliminate the plan’s
    responsibility for benefit obligations or risks associated with
    the obligations or assets used for the settlement. Curtailments
    result from an event that significantly reduces/eliminates plan
    participants’ expected years of future services or benefit
    accruals.

iv)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    pension and other postretirement fund assets in a particular
    year.

F-177


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains (Losses) —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on pension and
    other postretirement plan assets or projected (expected) pension
    benefit obligation during a particular period. These gains and
    losses are accumulated and, to the extent they exceed 10% of the
    greater of the PBO or the fair value of plan assets, the excess
    is amortized into pension and other postretirement benefit costs
    over the expected service years of the employees.

vi)

Amortization of Prior Service Costs — These costs
    relate to the recognition of increases or decreases in pension
    and other postretirement benefit obligation due to amendments in
    plans or initiation of new plans. These increases or decreases
    in obligation are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) at the time of the amendment. These costs are then
    amortized to pension and other postretirement benefit costs over
    the expected service years of the employees affected by the
    change.

The estimated net actuarial (gains) losses and prior service
    costs (credit) for the pension plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit costs over the next year are $176 million and
    $5 million, respectively.

The estimated net actuarial (gains) losses and prior service
    costs (credit) for the defined benefit other postretirement
    benefit plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic benefit costs over
    the next year are $34 million and ($108) million,
    respectively.

The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 created various subsidies
    for sponsors of retiree drug programs. Two common ways of
    providing subsidies were the Retiree Drug Subsidy
    (“RDS”) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug
    Plans (“PDP”). From 2006 through 2010, the Company
    applied for and received the RDS each year. The RDS program
    provides the subsidy through cash payments made by Medicare to
    the Company, resulting in smaller net claims paid by the
    Company. A summary of the reduction to the APBO and the related
    reduction to the components of net periodic other postretirement
    benefits plan costs resulting from receipt of the RDS is
    presented below. As of January 1, 2011, as a result of
    changes made under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
    Act of 2010, the Company will no longer apply for the RDS.
    Instead it has joined PDP and will indirectly receive Medicare
    subsidies in the form of smaller gross benefit payments for
    prescription drug coverage.

The weighted average discount rate for most plans is determined
    annually based on the yield, measured on a yield to worst basis,
    of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt
    instruments available on the valuation date, which would provide
    the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate projected
    benefit obligation when due.

The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets is
    based on anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in
    which the plans invest, weighted by target allocation
    percentages. Anticipated future performance is based on
    long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector,
    adjusted for the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on
    the performance of the markets. While the precise expected
    return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to
    year, the policy of most of the Subsidiaries’ is to hold
    this long-term assumption constant as long as it remains within
    reasonable tolerance from the derived rate.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets for use in
    that plan’s valuation in 2011 is currently anticipated to
    be 7.25% for pension benefits and postretirement medical
    benefits and 5.25% for postretirement life benefits.

The assumed healthcare costs trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit costs were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-and Post-Medicare eligible claims

7.8% in 2011, gradually decreasing each year until 2083 reaching
    the ultimate rate of 4.4%.

8.2% in 2010, gradually decreasing each year until 2079 reaching
    the ultimate rate of 4.1%.

Plan
    Assets

Most Subsidiaries have issued group annuity and life insurance
    contracts supporting the pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans assets, which are invested primarily in separate
    accounts.

The underlying assets of the separate accounts are principally
    comprised of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments,
    fixed maturity and equity securities, mutual funds, real estate,
    private equity investments and hedge funds investments.

The comparative presentation of the 2009 plan assets has been
    realigned to conform to the 2010 presentation to disclose the
    estimated fair value of the underlying assets of each separate
    account at the security level.

The pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are
    categorized into the three-level fair value hierarchy, as
    defined in Note 1, based upon the priority of the inputs to
    the respective valuation technique. The following summarizes the
    types of assets included within the three-level fair value
    hierarchy presented in the table above.

Level 1

This category includes investments in liquid securities, such as
    cash, short-term money market and bank time deposits, expected
    to mature within a year.

Level 2

This category includes certain separate accounts that are
    primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities.
    The estimated fair value of such separate account is based upon
    reported NAV provided by fund managers and this value represents
    the amount at which transfers into and out of the respective
    separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide
    reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated
    through observable market data.

Certain separate accounts are invested in investment
    partnerships designated as hedge funds. The values for these
    separate accounts is determined monthly based on the NAV of the
    underlying hedge fund investment. Additionally, such hedge funds
    generally contain lock out or other waiting period provisions
    for redemption requests to be filled. While the reporting and
    redemption restrictions may

F-183


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

limit the frequency of trading activity in separate accounts
    invested in hedge funds, the reported NAV, and thus the
    referenced value of the separate account, provides a reasonable
    level of price transparency that can be corroborated through
    observable market data. Directly held investments are primarily
    invested in U.S. and foreign government and corporate
    securities.

Level 3

This category includes separate accounts that are invested in
    real estate and private equity investments that provide little
    or no price transparency due to the infrequency with which the
    underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to
    liquidate in an orderly manner. Accordingly, the values for
    separate accounts invested in these alternative asset classes
    are based on inputs that cannot be readily derived from or
    corroborated by observable market data.

A rollforward of all pension and other postretirement benefit
    plan assets measured at estimated fair value on a recurring
    basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs

The U.S. Subsidiaries provide employees with benefits under
    various ERISA benefit plans. These include qualified pension
    plans, postretirement medical plans and certain retiree life
    insurance coverage. The assets of the Subsidiaries’
    qualified pension plans are held in insurance group annuity
    contracts, and the vast majority of the assets of the
    postretirement medical plan and backing the retiree life
    coverage are held in insurance contracts. All of these contracts
    are issued by Company insurance affiliates, and the assets under
    the contracts are held in insurance separate accounts that have
    been established by the Company. The insurance contract provider
    engages investment management firms (“Managers”) to
    serve as

sub-advisors

for the separate accounts based on the specific investment needs
    and requests identified by the plan fiduciary. These Managers
    have portfolio management discretion over the purchasing and
    selling of securities and other investment assets pursuant to
    the respective investment management agreements and guidelines
    established for each insurance separate account. The assets of
    the qualified pension plans and postretirement medical plans
    (the “Invested Plans”) are well diversified across
    multiple asset categories and across a number of different
    Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations
    within any given asset category or with any given Manager.

The Invested Plans, other than those held in participant
    directed investment accounts, are managed in accordance with
    investment policies consistent with the longer-term nature of
    related benefit obligations and within prudent risk parameters.
    Specifically, investment policies are oriented toward
    (i) maximizing the Invested Plan’s funded status;
    (ii) minimizing the volatility of the Invested Plan’s
    funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed
    liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of return in
    excess of a custom benchmark and industry standards over
    appropriate reference time periods. These goals are expected to
    be met through identifying appropriate and

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

diversified asset classes and allocations, ensuring adequate
    liquidity to pay benefits and expenses when due and controlling
    the costs of administering and managing the Invested Plan’s
    investments. Independent investment consultants are periodically
    used to evaluate the investment risk of Invested Plan’s
    assets relative to liabilities, analyze the economic and
    portfolio impact of various asset allocations and management
    strategies and to recommend asset allocations.

Certain foreign subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans that
    cover employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula,
    similar to the U.S. plans discussed above. The investment
    objectives are also similar, subject to local regulations.
    Generally, these international pension plans invest directly in
    high quality equity and fixed maturity securities. The assets of
    the foreign pension plans are comprised of cash and cash
    equivalents, equity and fixed maturity securities, real estate
    and hedge fund investments.

Derivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to
    manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an
    asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a
    portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an
    asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial
    variable. Derivatives are also prohibited for use in creating
    exposures to securities, currencies, indices or any other
    financial variable that are otherwise restricted.

Expected
    Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plan to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of ERISA. In accordance with such practice, no
    contributions were required for both of the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009. No contributions will be
    required for 2011. The Subsidiaries made discretionary
    contributions of $255 million to the qualified pension plan
    during the year ended December 31, 2010. The Subsidiaries
    made no discretionary contributions to the qualified pension
    plan during the year ended December 31, 2009. The
    Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions to the qualified pension plan of $175 million
    in 2011.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    primarily funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as
    they become due under the provision of the plans. These payments
    totaled $70 million and $57 million for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These
    payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in
    2011.

Postretirement benefits, other than those provided under
    qualified pension plans, are either: (i) not vested under
    law; (ii) a non-funded obligation of the Subsidiaries; or
    (iii) both. Current regulations do not require funding for
    these benefits. The Subsidiaries use their general assets, net
    of participant’s contributions, to pay postretirement
    medical claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing any plan
    assets. Total payments equaled $154 million and
    $158 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and
    2009, respectively.

The Subsidiaries expect to make contributions of
    $120 million, net of participant’s contributions,
    towards benefit obligations (other than those under qualified
    pension plans) in 2011. As noted previously, the Subsidiaries

F-187


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

no longer expect to receive the RDS under the Medicare
    Modernization Act of 2003 to partially offset payment of such
    benefits. Instead, the gross benefit payments that will be made
    under the PDP will already reflect subsidies.

Gross benefit payments for the next ten years, which reflect
    expected future service where appropriate, are expected to be as
    follows:

Additional
    Information

As previously discussed, most of the assets of the pension and
    other postretirement benefit plans are held in group annuity and
    life insurance contracts issued by the Subsidiaries. Total
    revenues from these contracts recognized in the consolidated
    statements of operations were $46 million, $45 million
    and $42 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, and included policy charges and net
    investment income from investments backing the contracts and
    administrative fees. Total investment income (loss), including
    realized and unrealized gains (losses), credited to the account
    balances was $767 million, $725 million and
    ($1,090) million for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The terms of these contracts
    are consistent in all material respects with those the
    Subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly
    situated.

Savings
    and Investment Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor savings and investment plans for
    substantially all Company employees under which a portion of
    employee contributions are matched. The Subsidiaries contributed
    $86 million, $93 million and $70 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

18.

Equity

Preferred
    Stock

There are 200,000,000 authorized shares of preferred stock, of
    which 6,857,000 shares were designated for issuance of
    convertible preferred stock in connection with the financing of
    the Acquisition. See “— Convertible Preferred
    Stock” below.

The Holding Company has outstanding 24 million shares of
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the
    “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $600 million.

The Holding Company has outstanding 60 million shares of
    6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the
    “Series B preferred shares”), with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Series A and Series B preferred shares (the
    “Preferred Shares”) rank senior to the Convertible
    Preferred Stock and the common stock with respect to dividends
    and liquidation rights. Dividends on the Preferred Shares are
    not cumulative. Holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled
    to receive dividend payments only when, as and if

F-188


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

declared by the Holding Company’s Board of Directors or a
    duly authorized committee of the Board. If dividends are
    declared on the Series A preferred shares, they will be
    payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of the greater
    of: (i) 1.00% above

3-month

LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the Holding Company has no obligation to
    pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not
    dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends
    may, however, be paid or declared on the Holding Company’s
    common stock — or any other securities ranking junior
    to the Preferred Shares — unless the full dividends
    for the latest completed dividend period on all Preferred
    Shares, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or
    provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and equity levels. In addition, under
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board policy, the Holding
    Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn
    sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable at the
    Holding Company’s option in whole or in part, at a
    redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share, plus declared and
    unpaid dividends.

In December 2008, the Holding Company entered into an RCC
    related to the Preferred Shares. As a part of the RCC, the
    Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem or
    purchase the Preferred Shares on or before December 31,
    2018, unless such repayment, redemption or purchase is made from
    the proceeds of the issuance of certain capital securities. The
    RCC is for the benefit of holders of one or more series of its
    indebtedness as designated from time to time by the Holding
    Company. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain
    events, including the date on which there are no series of
    outstanding eligible debt securities.

In connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, the
    Holding Company incurred $57 million of issuance costs
    which have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
    capital.

Convertible
    Preferred Stock

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition (see
    Note 2) in November 2010, the Holding Company issued
    to ALICO Holdings 6,857,000 shares of Convertible Preferred
    Stock with a $0.01 par value per share, a liquidation
    preference of $0.01 per share and a fair value of
    $2,805 million.

The Convertible Preferred Stock will convert into
    68,570,000 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock (subject to anti-dilution adjustments) upon a favorable
    vote of the Holding Company’s common stockholders. If the
    Company (i) pays a dividend or makes another distribution
    on common stock to all holders of common stock payable, in whole
    or in part, in shares of common stock; (ii) subdivides or
    splits the outstanding shares of common stock into a greater
    number of shares; or (iii) combines or reclassifies the
    outstanding shares of common stock into a smaller number of
    shares, then the conversion rate will be adjusted by multiplying
    the conversion rate by the number of shares of common stock
    which a person who owns only one share of common stock
    immediately before the record date or effective date of the
    applicable event would own immediately after giving effect to
    such dividend, distribution, subdivision, split, combination or
    reclassification. If a favorable vote of its common stockholders
    is not obtained by the first anniversary of the Acquisition
    Date, then the Company must pay ALICO Holdings approximately
    $300 million and use reasonable efforts to list the
    preferred stock on NYSE. The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks
    senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and
    liquidation rights, and holders of the Convertible Preferred
    Stock will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when,
    as and if declared by the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors. Under the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock,
    the Board will declare a dividend payment or other distribution
    on the Convertible Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis at
    any time and with the same terms as any dividend or other
    distribution declared on MetLife, Inc.’s common stock. No
    distribution is payable on the Convertible Preferred Stock
    unless there is a concurrent distribution on the MetLife, Inc.
    common stock.

F-190


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Convertible Preferred Stock does not have voting rights
    except in certain circumstances when the Convertible Preferred
    Stock is listed on the same exchange on which MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock is listed, and where the dividends have
    not been paid notwithstanding payment of dividends on MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock for an equivalent of six or more
    dividend payment periods whether or not those periods are
    consecutive. Under such circumstances, the holders of the
    Convertible Preferred Stock have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company. The Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable and
    is not subject to any sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase
    fund or similar provisions.

For purposes of the earnings per common share calculation, the
    Convertible Preferred Stock is assumed converted into shares of
    common stock for both basic and diluted weighted average shares.
    See Note 20.

Common
    Stock

Issuances

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition (see
    Note 2) in November 2010, the Holding Company issued
    to ALICO Holdings 78,239,712 new shares of its common stock at
    $40.90 per share with a fair value of $3,200 million.

In anticipation of the Acquisition (see Note 2), in August
    2010, the Holding Company issued 86,250,000 new shares of its
    common stock at $42.00 per share for gross proceeds of
    $3,623 million. In connection with the offering of common
    stock, the Holding Company incurred $94 million of issuance
    costs which have been recorded as a reduction of additional
    paid-in capital.

In February 2009, the Holding Company delivered
    24,343,154 shares of newly issued common stock for
    $1,035 million, and in August 2008 the Holding Company
    delivered 20,244,549 shares of its common stock from
    treasury stock also for $1,035 million. Each issuance was
    made in connection with the initial settlement of the stock
    purchase contracts issued as part of the common equity units
    sold in June 2005, as described in Note 14.

In October 2008, the Holding Company issued
    86,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $26.50
    per share for gross proceeds of $2,286 million. Of the
    shares issued, 75,000,000 shares, with a value of
    $4,040 million were issued from treasury stock for
    consideration of $1,988 million. In connection with the
    offering of common stock, the Holding Company incurred
    $60 million of issuance costs which have been recorded as a
    reduction of additional paid-in capital.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    332,121 shares, 861,586 shares and
    2,271,188 shares of common stock were issued from treasury
    stock for $18 million, $46 million and
    $118 million, respectively, to satisfy various stock option
    exercises and other stock-based awards. During the year ended
    December 31, 2010, 2,182,174 new shares of common stock
    were issued for $74 million to satisfy various stock option
    exercises and other stock-based awards. There were no new shares
    of common stock issued to satisfy the various stock option
    exercises and other stock-based awards during both of the years
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Repurchase
    Programs

At January 1, 2008, the Company had $511 million
    remaining under its September 2007 stock repurchase program
    authorization. In both January and April 2008, the
    Company’s Board of Directors authorized additional
    $1.0 billion common stock repurchase programs. During the
    year ended December 31, 2008, the Company repurchased
    19,716,418 shares under accelerated share repurchase
    programs and 1,550,000 shares under open market repurchases
    for $1,162 million and $88 million, respectively.
    During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the
    Company did not repurchase any shares. At December 31,
    2010, the Company had $1,261 million remaining under its
    January and April 2008 stock repurchase program authorizations.

MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Under these authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its
    common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open
    market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading
    plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated
    transactions. Any future common stock repurchases will be
    dependent upon several factors, including the Company’s
    capital position, its liquidity, its financial strength and
    credit ratings, general market conditions and the market price
    of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock compared to
    management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying
    value and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors.
    Whether or not to purchase any common stock and the size and
    timing of any such purchases will be determined in the
    Company’s complete discretion.

Other

In September 2008, in connection with the split-off of RGA as
    described in Note 2, the Holding Company received from
    MetLife, Inc. stockholders 23,093,689 shares of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock with a fair market value of
    $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock with a
    net book value of $1,716 million resulting in a loss on
    disposition, including transaction costs, of $458 million.

    Compensation Plans

Description
    of Plans for Employees and Agents — General
    Terms

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
    “2000 Stock Plan”) authorized the granting of awards
    to employees and agents in the form of options to buy shares of
    MetLife, Inc. common stock (“Stock Options”) that
    either qualify as incentive Stock Options under
    Section 422A of the Code or are non-qualified. By
    December 31, 2009 all awards under the 2000 Stock Plan had
    either vested or been forfeited. No awards were made under the
    2000 Stock Plan in 2010.

Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation
    Plan (the “2005 Stock Plan”), awards granted to
    employees and agents may be in the form of Stock Options, Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
    Performance Shares or Performance Share Units, Cash-Based Awards
    and Stock-Based Awards (each as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan
    with reference to MetLife, Inc. common stock).

The aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan is 68,000,000, plus those shares available but
    not utilized under the 2000 Stock Plan and those shares utilized
    under the 2000 Stock Plan that are recovered due to forfeiture
    of Stock Options. Each share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in
    connection with a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right
    reduces the number of shares remaining for issuance under that
    plan by one, and each share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in
    connection with awards other than Stock Options or Stock
    Appreciation Rights reduces the number of shares remaining for
    issuance under that plan by 1.179 shares. At
    December 31, 2010, the aggregate number of shares remaining
    available for issuance pursuant to the 2005 Stock

Plan was 40,477,451. Stock Option exercises and other awards
    settled in shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares
    held in treasury by the Company or by the issuance of new shares.

Compensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan
    is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest,
    which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures
    over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant.
    Unless a material deviation from the assumed forfeiture rate is
    observed during the term in which the awards are expensed, any
    adjustment necessary to reflect differences in actual experience
    is recognized in the period the award becomes payable or
    exercisable.

Compensation expense related to awards under the 2005 Stock Plan
    is principally related to the issuance of Stock Options,
    Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units. The majority of
    the awards granted each year under the 2005 Stock Plan are made
    in the first quarter of each year.

Description
    of Plans for Directors — General Terms

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan, as amended
    (the “2000 Directors Stock Plan”) authorized the
    granting of awards in the form of MetLife, Inc. common stock,
    non-qualified Stock Options, or a combination of the foregoing
    to non-management Directors of MetLife, Inc. As of
    December 31, 2009, all awards under the 2000 Directors
    Stock Plan had either vested or been forfeited. No awards were
    made under the 2000 Directors Stock Plan in 2010.

Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management Director Stock
    Compensation Plan (the “2005 Directors Stock
    Plan”), awards granted may be in the form of non-qualified
    Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or
    Restricted Stock Units, or Stock-Based Awards (each as
    defined in the 2005 Directors Stock Plan with reference to
    MetLife, Inc. common stock) to non-management Directors of
    MetLife, Inc. The number of shares authorized for issuance under
    the 2005 Directors Stock Plan is 2,000,000. There were no
    shares carried forward from the 2000 Directors Stock Plan
    to the 2005 Directors Stock Plan. At December 31,
    2010, the aggregate number of shares remaining available for
    issuance pursuant to the 2005 Directors Stock Plan was
    1,808,114. Stock Option exercises and other awards settled in
    shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares held in
    treasury by the Company or by the issuance of new shares.

Compensation expense related to awards under the
    2005 Directors Plan is recognized based on the number of
    shares awarded. The Stock-Based Awards granted under the
    2005 Directors Plan have vested immediately. The majority
    of the awards granted each year under the 2005 Directors
    Stock Plan are made in the second quarter of each year.

Stock
    Options

Stock Options are the contingent right of award holders to
    purchase shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock at a stated price
    for a limited time. All Stock Options have an exercise price
    equal to the closing price of MetLife, Inc. common stock
    reported on the NYSE on the date of grant, and have a maximum
    term of ten years. The vast majority of Stock Options granted
    have become or will become exercisable at a rate of one-third of
    each award on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant
    date. Other Stock Options have become or will become exercisable
    on the third anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject
    to continued service, except for employees who are retirement
    eligible and in certain other limited circumstances.

The total fair value on the date of the grant was
    $53 million.

The fair value of Stock Options is estimated on the date of
    grant using a binomial lattice model. Significant assumptions
    used in the Company’s binomial lattice model, which are
    further described below, include: expected volatility of the
    price of MetLife, Inc. common stock; risk-free rate of return;
    expected dividend yield on MetLife, Inc. common stock; exercise
    multiple; and the post-vesting termination rate.

Expected volatility is based upon an analysis of historical
    prices of MetLife, Inc. common stock and call options on that
    common stock traded on the open market. The Company uses a
    weighted-average of the implied volatility for publicly-traded
    call options with the longest remaining maturity nearest to the
    money as of each

F-194


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

valuation date and the historical volatility, calculated using
    monthly closing prices of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock. The
    Company chose a monthly measurement interval for historical
    volatility as it believes this better depicts the nature of
    employee option exercise decisions being based on longer-term
    trends in the price of the underlying shares rather than on
    daily price movements.

The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates
    different risk-free rates based on the imputed forward rates for
    U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual
    term of the option. The table below presents the full range of
    rates that were used for options granted during the respective
    periods.

Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend
    distributions compared to the price of the underlying common
    stock as of the valuation date and held constant over the life
    of the Stock Option.

The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates the
    contractual term of the Stock Options and then factors in
    expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting termination rate,
    or the rate at which vested options are exercised or expire
    prematurely due to termination of employment, to derive an
    expected life. Exercise behavior in the binomial lattice model
    used by the Company is expressed using an exercise multiple,
    which reflects the ratio of exercise price to the strike price
    of Stock Options granted at which holders of the Stock Options
    are expected to exercise. The exercise multiple is derived from
    actual historical exercise activity. The post-vesting
    termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise
    experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.

The following table presents the weighted average assumptions,
    with the exception of risk-free rate, which is expressed as a
    range, used to determine the fair value of Stock Options issued:

Performance
    Shares

Performance Shares are units that, if they vest, are multiplied
    by a performance factor to produce a number of final Performance
    Shares which are payable in shares of MetLife, Inc. common
    stock. Performance Shares are accounted for as equity awards,
    but are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual
    dividends paid on MetLife, Inc. common stock during the
    performance period. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of
    Performance Shares is based upon the closing price of MetLife,
    Inc. common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present
    value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock during the
    performance period.

Performance Share awards normally vest in their entirety at the
    end of the three-year performance period. Vesting is subject to
    continued service, except for employees who are retirement
    eligible and in certain other limited circumstances. Vested
    Performance Shares are multiplied by a performance factor of 0.0
    to 2.0 based largely on MetLife, Inc.’s performance in
    change in annual net operating earnings and total shareholder
    return over the applicable three-year performance period
    compared to the performance of its competitors. A performance
    factor of 0.94 was applied for the January 1,
    2007 — December 31, 2009 performance period.

    the end of the respective performance periods. At
    December 31, 2010, the three year performance period for
    the 2008 Performance Share grants was completed, but the
    performance factor has not yet been calculated. Included in the
    immediately preceding table are 824,825 outstanding Performance
    Shares to which the performance factor will be applied.

Restricted
    Stock Units

Restricted Stock Units are units that, if they vest, are payable
    in shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock. Restricted Stock Units
    are accounted for as equity awards, but are not credited with
    dividend-equivalents for actual dividends paid on MetLife, Inc.
    common stock during the performance period. Accordingly, the
    estimated fair value of Restricted Stock Units is based upon the
    closing price of MetLife, Inc. common stock on the date of
    grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be
    paid on that stock during the performance period.

The vast majority of Restricted Stock Units normally vest in
    their entirety on the third anniversary of their grant date.
    Other Restricted Stock Units normally vest in their entirety on
    the fifth anniversary of their grant date. Vesting is subject to
    continued service, except for employees who are retirement
    eligible and in certain other limited circumstances.

Statutory
    Equity and Income

Except for American Life, each insurance company’s state of
    domicile imposes minimum risk-based capital (“RBC”)
    requirements that were developed by the NAIC. The formulas for
    determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors
    that are applied to financial balances or various levels of
    activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Regulatory
    compliance is determined by a ratio of total adjusted capital,
    as defined by the NAIC, to authorized control level RBC, as
    defined by the NAIC. Companies below specific trigger points or
    ratios are classified within certain levels, each of which
    requires specified corrective action. Each of the Holding
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries exceeded the
    minimum RBC requirements for all periods presented herein.

American Life does not write business in Delaware or any other
    domestic state and, as such, is exempt from RBC by Delaware law.
    American Life operations are regulated by applicable authorities
    of the countries in which the company operates and are subject
    to capital and solvency requirements in those countries.

The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Statutory Codification”). Statutory
    Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting
    and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory
    accounting principles continue to be established by individual
    state laws and permitted practices. The New York Insurance
    Department (the “Department”) has adopted Statutory
    Codification with certain modifications for the preparation of
    statutory financial statements of insurance companies domiciled
    in New York. Modifications by the various state insurance
    departments may impact the effect of Statutory Codification on
    the statutory capital and surplus of the Holding Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries.

Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by
    charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred,
    establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different
    actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus
    instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.

In addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory
    accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The
    most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net
    deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences
    between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not
    expected to reverse and become recoverable within three years.
    Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition
    to purchase accounting adjustments.

Statutory net income (loss) of MLIC, a New York domiciled
    insurer, was $2,066 million, $1,221 million and
    ($338) million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, to
    be filed with the Department, was $13.2 billion and
    $12.6 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively.

In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the
    years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, cash dividends in
    the aggregate amount of $0 and $215 million, respectively,
    were paid to the Holding Company.

Under New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount
    of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the
    lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately

preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year
    (excluding realized capital gains). MLIC will be permitted to
    pay a dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of
    such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to
    declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the
    Superintendent and the Superintendent does not disapprove the
    dividend within 30 days of its filing. Under New York State
    Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad discretion in
    determining whether the financial condition of a stock life
    insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to
    its shareholders.

Under Delaware State Insurance Law, each of American Life and
    MTL is permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance,
    to pay a stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as
    the amount of the dividend when aggregated with all other
    dividends in the preceding 12 months does not exceed the
    greater of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or
    (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital
    gains). Each of American Life and MTL will be permitted to pay a
    dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the greater of such
    two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration of such a
    dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware Commissioner
    of Insurance (the “Delaware Commissioner”) and the
    Delaware Commissioner either approves the distribution of the
    dividend or does not disapprove the distribution within
    30 days of its filing. In addition, any dividend that
    exceeds earned surplus (defined as unassigned funds) as of the
    last filed annual statutory statement requires insurance
    regulatory approval. Under Delaware State Insurance Law, the
    Delaware Commissioner has broad discretion in determining
    whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance
    company would support the payment of such dividends to its
    shareholders.

Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, MICC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to its stockholders as long as the amount of such
    dividends, when aggregated with all other dividends in the
    preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of:
    (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of
    the immediately preceding calendar year; or (ii) its
    statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding
    calendar year. MICC will be permitted to pay a dividend in
    excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files
    notice of its declaration of such a dividend and the amount
    thereof with the Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance (the
    “Connecticut Commissioner”) and the Connecticut
    Commissioner does not disapprove the payment within 30 days
    after notice. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned
    surplus (unassigned funds, reduced by 25% of unrealized
    appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized
    profits on investments) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under
    Connecticut State Insurance Law, the Connecticut Commissioner
    has broad discretion in determining whether the financial
    condition of a stock life insurance company would support the
    payment of such dividends to its shareholders.

Under Rhode Island State Insurance Law, MPC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a
    stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any twelve-month
    period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its
    surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) net income, not including
    realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar
    year, which may include carry forward net income from the second
    and third preceding calendar years excluding realized capital
    gains and less dividends paid in the second and immediately
    preceding calendar years. MPC will be permitted to pay a
    dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such
    two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare
    such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Rhode Island
    Commissioner”) and the Rhode Island Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    Under Rhode Island State Insurance Code, the Rhode Island
    Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the
    financial condition of a stock property and casualty insurance
    company would support the payment of such dividends to its
    shareholders.

See Note 6 for DAC and VOBA by segment and a rollforward of
    each including impacts of capitalization and amortization. See
    also Note 10 for a description of the DAC amortization
    impact associated with the closed block. Amortization of DAC and
    VOBA includes amortization of negative VOBA related to the
    Acquisition of $64 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. Negative VOBA is recorded in other
    policy-related balances (see Note 2) and therefore,
    the amortization of negative VOBA is an offset to the VOBA
    amortization in Note 6.

Interest
    Expense on Debt and Debt Issue Costs

See Notes 11, 12, 13 and 14 for attribution of interest
    expense by debt issuance. Interest expense on debt and debt
    issue costs includes interest expense related to CSEs of
    $411 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and
    $0 for both of the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    See Note 3.

Lease
    Impairments

See Note 16 for description of lease impairments included
    within other expenses.

Costs
    Related to the Acquisition

See Note 2 for transaction costs and integration-related
    expenses related to the Acquisition which were included in other
    expenses.

Restructuring
    Charges

In September 2008, the Company began an enterprise-wide cost
    reduction and revenue enhancement initiative which is expected
    to be fully implemented by December 31, 2011. This
    initiative is focused on reducing complexity, leveraging scale,
    increasing productivity and improving the effectiveness of the
    Company’s operations, as well as providing a foundation for
    future growth. These restructuring costs were included in

F-201

other expenses. As the expenses relate to an enterprise-wide
    initiative, they were incurred within Banking,
    Corporate & Other. Estimated restructuring costs may
    change as management continues to execute its restructuring
    plans. Restructuring charges associated with this
    enterprise-wide initiative were as follows:

For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the
    change in severance charge estimates of ($1) million,
    ($8) million and ($8) million, respectively, was due
    to changes in estimates for variable incentive compensation,
    COBRA benefits, employee outplacement services and for employees
    whose severance status changed.

In addition to the above charges, the Company has recognized
    lease charges of $28 million associated with the
    consolidation of office space since the inception of the
    initiative.

Management anticipates further restructuring charges, including
    severance, lease and asset impairments, will be incurred during
    the year ending December 31, 2011. However, such
    restructuring plans were not sufficiently developed to enable
    the Company to make an estimate of such restructuring charges at
    December 31, 2010.

See Note 2 for discussion of restructuring charges related
    to the Acquisition.

Business
    Segment Information

MetLife is organized into five segments: Insurance Products,
    Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and
    Auto & Home (collectively,
    “U.S. Business”) and International. The assets
    and liabilities of ALICO as of November 30, 2010 and the
    operating results of ALICO from the Acquisition Date through
    November 30, 2010 are included in the International
    segment. In addition, the Company reports certain of its results
    of operations in Banking, Corporate & Other, which
    includes MetLife Bank and other business activities. For
    reporting purposes beginning in 2011, our

non-U.S. Business

results will be presented within two separate segments: Japan
    and Other International Regions.

Insurance Products offers a broad range of protection products
    and services to individuals and corporations, as well as other
    institutions and their respective employees, and is organized
    into three distinct businesses: Group Life, Individual Life and
    Non-Medical Health. Group Life insurance products and services
    include variable life, universal life and term life products.
    Individual Life insurance products and services include variable
    life, universal life, term life and whole life products.
    Non-Medical Health products and services include dental
    insurance, short- and long-term disability, long-term care and
    other insurance products. Retirement Products offers asset
    accumulation and income products, including a wide variety of
    annuities. Corporate Benefit Funding offers pension risk
    solutions, structured settlements, stable value and investment
    products and other benefit funding products. Auto &
    Home provides personal lines property and casualty insurance,
    including private passenger automobile, homeowners and personal
    excess liability insurance. In the fourth quarter of 2010,
    management realigned certain income annuity products within the
    Company’s segments to better conform to the way it manages
    and assesses its business and began reporting such product
    results in the Retirement Products segment, previously reported
    in the Corporate Benefit Funding segment. Accordingly, prior
    period results for these segments have been adjusted by
    $29 million and $13 million of operating losses, net
    of $15 million and $8 million of income tax benefits,
    for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, to reflect such product reclassifications.

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowments and
    retirement & savings products to both individuals and
    groups.

Banking, Corporate & Other contains the excess capital
    not allocated to the segments, the results of operations of
    MetLife Bank, various

start-up

entities and run-off entities, as well as interest expense
    related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt
    and expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and
    income tax audit issues. Banking, Corporate & Other
    also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which
    generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest
    rates commensurate with related borrowings.

Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss the
    Company uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate
    resources. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment
    reporting, it is the Company’s measure of segment
    performance reported below. Operating earnings does not equate
    to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax
    or net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP and
    should not be viewed as a substitute for those GAAP measures.
    The Company believes the presentation of operating earnings
    herein as the Company measures it for management purposes
    enhances the understanding of its performance by highlighting
    the results from operations and the underlying profitability
    drivers of the businesses.

Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less
    operating expenses, net of income tax.

Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net
    investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses);
    (ii) less amortization of unearned revenue related to net
    investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses);
    (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify
    for hedge accounting treatment; (iv) plus income from
    discontinued real estate operations; (v) less net
    investment income related to contractholder-directed unit-linked
    investments; and (vi) plus, for operating joint ventures
    reported under the equity method of accounting, the
    aforementioned adjustments, those identified in the definition
    of operating expenses and changes in fair value of hedges of
    operating joint venture liabilities, all net of income tax.

F-205


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less
    changes in policyholder benefits associated with asset value
    fluctuations related to experience-rated contractholder
    liabilities and certain inflation-indexed liabilities;
    (ii) less costs related to business combinations (since
    January 1, 2009) and noncontrolling interests;
    (iii) less amortization of DAC and VOBA and changes in the
    policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains
    (losses) and net derivative gains (losses); (iv) less
    interest credited to policyholder account balances related to
    contractholder-directed unit-linked investments; and
    (v) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but
    do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

In addition, operating revenues and operating expenses do not
    reflect the consolidation of certain securitization entities
    that are VIEs as required under GAAP.

Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information
    with respect to the Company’s segments, as well as Banking,
    Corporate & Other for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 and at December 31,
    2010 and 2009. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those of the Company, except for the method of capital
    allocation and the accounting for gains (losses) from
    intercompany sales, which are eliminated in consolidation.
    Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in the Company’s businesses. As a part of
    the economic capital process, a portion of net investment income
    is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated
    equity. The Company allocates certain non-recurring items, such
    as expenses associated with certain legal proceedings, to
    Banking, Corporate & Other.

Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each
    segment’s specifically identifiable asset portfolio
    adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each
    of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of
    such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of
    employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and
    (iii) cost estimates included in the Company’s product
    pricing.

Operating revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10%
    of consolidated operating revenues for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Operating revenues from
    U.S. operations were $44.9 billion, $42.8 billion
    and $42.9 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which represented 85%, 87%
    and 87%, respectively, of consolidated operating revenues.

Discontinued
    Operations

Real
    Estate

The Company actively manages its real estate portfolio with the
    objective of maximizing earnings through selective acquisitions
    and dispositions. Income related to real estate classified as

held-for-sale

or sold is presented in discontinued operations. These assets
    are carried at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair
    value less expected disposition costs. Income from discontinued
    real estate operations, net of income tax, was $3 million,
    $11 million and $13 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The carrying value of real estate related to discontinued
    operations was $8 million and $55 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Operations

Texas
    Life Insurance Company

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Holding Company entered
    into an agreement to sell its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cova, the
    parent company of Texas Life, to a third-party and the sale
    occurred in March 2009. See Note 2. The following table
    presents the amounts related to the operations of Cova that have
    been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated

Reinsurance
    Group of America, Incorporated

As more fully described in Note 2, the Company completed a
    tax-free split-off of its majority-owned subsidiary, RGA in
    September 2008. The following table presents the amounts related
    to the operations of RGA that have been reflected as
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax

$

(261

The operations of RGA included direct policies and reinsurance
    agreements with MetLife and some of its subsidiaries. These
    agreements are generally terminable by either party upon
    90 days written notice with respect to future new business.
    Agreements related to existing business generally are not
    terminable, unless the underlying policies terminate or are
    recaptured. These direct policies and reinsurance agreements do
    not constitute significant continuing involvement by the Company
    with RGA. Included in continuing operations in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations are amounts
    related to these transactions, including ceded amounts that
    reduced premiums and fees by $158 million and ceded amounts
    that reduced policyholder benefits and claims by
    $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 that
    have not been eliminated as these transactions have continued
    after the RGA disposition.

Subsequent
    Events

Dividends

On February 18, 2011, the Holding Company announced
    dividends of $0.2500000 per share, for a total of
    $6 million, on its Series A preferred shares, and
    $0.4062500 per share, for a total of $24 million, on its
    Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 7, 2011. Both
    dividends will be payable March 15, 2011 to shareholders of
    record as of February 28, 2011.

Credit
    Facility

On February 1, 2011, the Holding Company entered into a
    committed facility with a third-party bank to provide letters of
    credit for the benefit of Missouri Reinsurance (Barbados) Inc.
    (“MoRe”), a captive reinsurance subsidiary, to address
    its short-term solvency needs based on guidance from the
    regulator. This one-year facility provides for the issuance of
    letters of credit in amounts up to $350 million. Under the
    facility, a letter of credit for $250 million was issued on
    February 2, 2011 and increased to $295 million on
    February 23, 2011, which management believes satisfies
    MoRe’s solvency requirements.

MetLife,

Schedule II

Notes to
    the Condensed Financial Information of Registrant

1.

Basis of
    Presentation

The condensed financial information of MetLife, Inc. (the
    “Holding Company” or the “Registrant”)
    should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
    statements of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries and the notes
    thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).
    These condensed unconsolidated financial statements reflect the
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the
    Holding Company. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting.

The preparation of these condensed unconsolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
    requires management to adopt accounting policies and make
    certain estimates and assumptions. The most important of these
    estimates and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements,
    the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets
    and the provision for potential losses that may arise from
    litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may
    affect the amounts reported in the condensed unconsolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ from these estimates.

2.

Acquisition

On November 1, 2010, the Holding Company acquired all of
    the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Life
    Insurance Company (“American Life”) and Delaware
    American Life Insurance Company (collectively,
    “ALICO”). For further information on the
    $16.4 billion purchase price including cash, common stock,
    convertible preferred stock and common equity units, as well as
    on the capital raised in anticipation of the acquisition, see
    Notes 2, 11, 14 and 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

3.

Schedule II

Notes to
    the Condensed Financial Information of
    Registrant — (Continued)

has agreed to cause each such entity to meet specified capital
    and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations.

In November 2010, the Holding Company guaranteed the obligations
    of Exeter Reassurance Company Ltd. (“Exeter”) in an
    aggregate amount up to $1.0 billion, under a reinsurance
    agreement with MetLife Europe Limited (“MEL”), under
    which Exeter reinsures the guaranteed living benefits and
    guaranteed death benefits associated with certain unit-linked
    annuity contracts issued by MEL.

In January 2010, the Holding Company guaranteed the obligations
    of its subsidiary, Missouri Reinsurance (Barbados) Inc.
    (“MoRe”), under a retrocession agreement with RGA
    Reinsurance (Barbados) Inc., pursuant to which MoRe retrocedes
    certain group term life insurance issued by MLIC.

In December 2009, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont’s (“MRV”)
    reinsurance of certain universal life and term life insurance
    risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to
    take necessary action to cause the third protected cell of MRV
    to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200%
    of such protected cell’s authorized control level
    risk-based capital (“RBC”), as defined in state
    insurance statutes. See Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with MRV’s reinsurance
    of certain universal life and term life insurance risks,
    committed to the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
    Securities and Health Care Administration to take necessary
    action to cause each of the two initial protected cells of MRV
    to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200%
    of such protected cell’s authorized control level RBC,
    as defined in state insurance statutes. See Note 11 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with the collateral financing
    arrangement associated with MetLife Reinsurance Company of
    Charleston’s (“MRC”) reinsurance of a portion of
    the liabilities associated with the closed block, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to make capital
    contributions, if necessary, to MRC so that MRC may at all times
    maintain its total adjusted capital at a level of not less than
    200% of the company action level RBC, as defined in state
    insurance statutes as in effect on the date of determination or
    December 31, 2007, whichever calculation produces the
    greater capital requirement, or as otherwise required by the
    South Carolina Department of Insurance. See Note 12 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company, in connection with the collateral financing
    arrangement associated with MetLife Reinsurance Company of South
    Carolina’s (“MRSC”) reinsurance of universal life
    secondary guarantees, committed to the South Carolina Department
    of Insurance to take necessary action to cause MRSC to maintain
    total adjusted capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 100%
    of MRSC’s authorized control level RBC, as defined in
    state insurance statutes. See Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by
    state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it
    to meet its current obligations on a timely basis.

    Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited (“MSI
    MetLife”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSI
    MetLife to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for
    MSI MetLife to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as
    calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business Law of
    Japan, and to make such loans to MSI MetLife as may be necessary
    to ensure that MSI MetLife has sufficient cash or other liquid
    assets to meet its payment

F-219


MetLife,
    Inc.

obligations as they fall due. As described in Note 2 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Holding
    Company reached an agreement to sell its 50% interest in MSI
    MetLife to a third-party. Upon the close of such sale, the
    Holding Company’s obligations under the net worth
    maintenance agreement will terminate.

The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter, under a reinsurance agreement with MSI
    MetLife under which Exeter reinsures variable annuities written
    by MSI MetLife. This guarantee will remain in place until such
    time as the reinsurance agreement between Exeter and MSI MetLife
    is terminated, notwithstanding any prior disposition of the
    Holding Company’s interest in MSI MetLife as described in
    Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Holding Company also guarantees the obligations of a number
    of its subsidiaries under credit facilities with third-party

Controls
    and Procedures

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,
    estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
    expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The
    objectives of internal control include providing management with
    reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are
    safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,
    and that transactions are executed in accordance with
    management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit
    the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“GAAP”).

Management has documented and evaluated the effectiveness of the
    internal control of the Company at December 31, 2010
    pertaining to financial reporting in accordance with the
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission.

On November 1, 2010, the Holding Company acquired all of
    the issued and outstanding capital stock of American Life
    Insurance Company and Delaware American Life Insurance Company
    (collectively, “ALICO”). As allowed under the
    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
    “SEC”) guidance, management’s assessment of and
    conclusion regarding the design and effectiveness of internal
    control over financial reporting excluded the internal control
    over financial reporting of ALICO, which is relevant to the
    Company’s 2010 consolidated financial statements as of and
    for the year ended December 31, 2010. ALICO represents 17%
    of total assets, and 2% of total revenues of MetLife, Inc. as of
    and for the year ended December 31, 2010. The financial
    reporting systems of ALICO have not yet been integrated into the
    Company’s financial reporting systems and, as such, the
    Company did not have the practical ability to perform an
    assessment of ALICO’s internal control over financial
    reporting in time for this current year-end. Management expects
    to complete the process of integrating ALICO’s internal
    control over financial reporting over the course of 2011. The
    ALICO acquisition represents a material change in internal
    control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

during the quarter ended December 31, 2010.

In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
    2010.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial
    statements and consolidated financial statement schedules
    included in the Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Report of the
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on their audit of
    the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedules is included at

page F-1.

Attestation
    Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their
    attestation report on management’s internal control over
    financial reporting which is set forth below.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. As described in Management’s Annual Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded
    from its assessment the internal control over financial
    reporting at ALICO, acquired on November 1, 2010, as the
    financial reporting systems of ALICO have not yet been
    integrated into the Company’s financial reporting systems
    and, as such, the Company did not have the practical ability to
    perform an assessment of ALICO’s internal control over
    financial reporting in time for this current year-end. ALICO
    represents 17% of total assets and 2% of total revenues of the
    Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over
    financial reporting at ALICO. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control
    Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules of the Company as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 24, 2011
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules.
