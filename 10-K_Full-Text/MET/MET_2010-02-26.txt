Note
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, may contain or
    incorporate by reference information that includes or is based
    upon forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of
    future events. These statements can be identified by the fact
    that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.
    They use words such as “anticipate,”
    “estimate,” “expect,” “project,”
    “intend,” “plan,” “believe” and
    other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a
    discussion of future operating or financial performance. In
    particular, these include statements relating to future actions,
    prospective services or products, future performance or results
    of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts,
    expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal
    proceedings, trends in operations and financial results. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations.”

Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.
    They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining MetLife’s actual future results.
    These statements are based on current expectations and the
    current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and
    uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could
    differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other
    factors that might cause such differences include the risks,
    uncertainties and other factors identified in MetLife,
    Inc.’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the “SEC”). These factors include:
    (i) difficult and adverse conditions in the global and
    domestic capital and credit markets; (ii) continued
    volatility and further deterioration of the capital and credit
    markets, which may affect the Company’s ability to seek
    financing or access its credit facilities;
    (iii) uncertainty about the effectiveness of the
    U.S. government’s plan to stabilize the financial
    system by injecting capital into financial institutions,
    purchasing large amounts of illiquid, mortgage-backed and other
    securities from financial institutions, or otherwise;
    (iv) exposure to financial and capital market risk;
    (v) changes in general economic conditions, including the
    performance of financial markets and interest rates, which may
    affect the Company’s ability to raise capital, generate fee
    income and market-related revenue and finance statutory reserve
    requirements and may require the Company to pledge collateral or
    make payments related to declines in value of specified assets;
    (vi) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from
    MetLife’s participation in a securities lending program and
    other transactions; (vii) investment losses and defaults,
    and changes to investment valuations; (viii) impairments of
    goodwill and realized losses or market value impairments to
    illiquid assets; (ix) defaults on the Company’s
    mortgage loans; (x) the impairment of other financial
    institutions; (xi) MetLife’s ability to identify and
    consummate on successful terms any future acquisitions, and to
    successfully integrate acquired businesses with minimal
    disruption; (xii) economic, political, currency and other
    risks relating to the Company’s international operations;
    (xiii) MetLife, Inc.’s primary reliance, as a holding
    company, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet debt payment
    obligations and the applicable regulatory restrictions on the
    ability of the subsidiaries to pay such dividends;
    (xiv) downgrades in MetLife, Inc.’s and its
    affiliates’ claims paying ability, financial strength or
    credit ratings; (xv) ineffectiveness of risk management
    policies and procedures, including with respect to guaranteed
    benefits (which may be affected by fair value adjustments
    arising from changes in our own credit spread) on certain of the
    Company’s variable annuity products;
    (xvi) availability and effectiveness of reinsurance or
    indemnification arrangements; (xvii) discrepancies between
    actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices
    for the Company’s products and establishing the liabilities
    for the Company’s obligations for future policy benefits
    and claims; (xviii) catastrophe losses;
    (xix) heightened competition, including with respect to
    pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of
    distributors, the development of new products by new and
    existing competitors and for personnel; (xx) unanticipated
    changes in industry trends; (xxi) changes in accounting
    standards, practices

and/or

policies; (xxii) changes in assumptions related to deferred
    policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), value of business
    acquired (“VOBA”) or goodwill; (xxiii) increased
    expenses relating to pension and postretirement benefit plans;
    (xxiv) deterioration in the experience of the “closed
    block” established in connection with the reorganization of
    MLIC; (xxv) adverse results or other consequences from
    litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations;



(xxvi) discrepancies between actual experience and
    assumptions used in establishing liabilities related to other
    contingencies or obligations; (xxvii) regulatory,
    legislative or tax changes that may affect the cost of, or
    demand for, the Company’s products or services;
    (xxviii) the effects of business disruption or economic
    contraction due to terrorism, other hostilities, or natural
    catastrophes; (xxix) the effectiveness of the
    Company’s programs and practices in avoiding giving its
    associates incentives to take excessive risks; and
    (xxx) other risks and uncertainties described from time to
    time in MetLife, Inc.’s filings with the SEC.

MetLife, Inc. does not undertake any obligation to publicly
    correct or update any forward-looking statement if MetLife, Inc.
    later becomes aware that such statement is not likely to be
    achieved. Please consult any further disclosures MetLife, Inc.
    makes on related subjects in reports to the SEC.

Part I

Item 1.

Business

As used in this

Form 10-K,

“MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,”
    “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”).

With a more than

140-year

history, we have grown to become a leading, global provider of
    insurance, employee benefits and financial services with more
    than 70 million customers and operations throughout the
    United States and the regions of Latin America, Asia
    Pacific and Europe, Middle East and India (“EMEI”).
    Over the past several years, we have grown our core businesses,
    as well as successfully executed on our growth strategy. This
    has included completing a number of transactions that have
    resulted in the acquisition and in some cases divestiture of
    certain businesses while also further strengthening our balance
    sheet to position MetLife for continued growth.

In December 2009, we began reporting results under our new
    U.S. Business organization. U.S. Business consists of
    Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit
    Funding (“CBF”) and Auto & Home. The former
    Institutional Business & Individual Business segments
    have been reclassified into the following three segments:

•

Insurance Products (group life, individual life and non-medical
    health insurance products);

•

Retirement Products (individual and institutional annuity
    products); and

•

Corporate Benefit Funding (pension closeouts, structured
    settlements and other benefit funding solutions).

The financial reporting format for the Auto & Home
    segment, which is also part of U.S. Business and consists
    of our property & casualty insurance products, remains
    unchanged from prior periods.

Through our U.S. Business organization, we provide a
    variety of insurance and financial services products —
    including life, dental, disability and long-term care insurance,
    guaranteed interest and stable value products, various annuity
    products, and auto & home insurance —
    through both proprietary and independent retail distribution
    channels, as well as at the workplace. This business serves over
    60,000 group customers, including over 90 of the top one hundred
    FORTUNE

®

companies, and provides protection and retirement solutions to
    millions of individuals.

Our International segment operates in 16 countries within the
    Latin America, Asia Pacific and EMEI regions. MetLife is the
    largest life insurer in Mexico and also holds leading market
    positions in Chile and Japan. We are also investing in organic
    growth efforts in a number of countries, including India, China
    and South Korea. International is the fastest-growing of
    MetLife’s businesses, and we have clearly identified it to
    be one of the biggest future growth areas.

Within the U.S., we also provide a wide array of savings and
    mortgage banking products. Through its own organic growth
    efforts and the completion of two mortgage company acquisitions
    in 2008, MetLife Bank, National Association (“MetLife
    Bank”), ranked among the top four reverse mortgage
    originators and the top 11 mortgage originators for the year
    ended December 31, 2009, according to Reverse Mortgage
    Insight and Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry trade group
    publication. Results of our banking operation are reported in
    Banking, Corporate & Other.

Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of
    consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. Financial
    information, including revenues, expenses, income and loss, and
    total assets by segment, is provided in Note 22 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

With a $328 billion general account portfolio invested
    primarily in investment grade corporate bonds, structured
    finance securities, commercial & agricultural mortgage
    loans, U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed
    securities, as well as real estate and corporate equity, we are
    one of the largest institutional investors in the United States.
    Over the past several years, we have taken a number of actions
    to further diversify and strengthen our general account
    portfolio.



Our well-recognized brand names, leading market positions,
    competitive and innovative product offerings and financial
    strength and expertise should help drive future growth and
    enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of
    fairness, honesty and integrity.

Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the
    following specific objectives to achieve our goals:

•

Build on our widely recognized brand name

•

Capitalize on our large customer base of institutions and
    individual consumers

•

Expand and leverage our broad, diverse distribution
    channels

•

Continue to introduce innovative and competitive products

Capitalize on opportunities to provide retirement income
    solutions

•

Maintain balanced focus on income and protection products

Maintain and enhance capital efficiency

•

Continue to achieve organizational efficiencies through our
    Operational Excellence initiative

Overview

Insurance
    Products

Our Insurance Products segment offers a broad range of
    protection products and services aimed at serving the financial
    needs of our customers throughout their lives. These products
    are sold to individuals and corporations, as well as other
    institutions and their respective employees. We have built a
    leading position in the U.S. group insurance market through
    long-standing relationships with many of the largest corporate
    employers in the United States, and are one of the largest
    issuers of individual life insurance products in the United
    States. We are organized into three businesses: Group Life,
    Individual Life and Non-Medical Health.

Our Group Life insurance products and services include variable
    life, universal life, and term life products. We offer group
    insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary
    benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the
    employee. These group products and services also include
    employee paid supplemental life and are offered as standard
    products or may be tailored to meet specific customer needs.

Our Individual Life insurance products and services include
    variable life, universal life, term life and whole life
    products. Additionally, through our broker-dealer affiliates, we
    offer a full range of mutual funds and other securities
    products. The elimination of transactions from activity between
    the segments within U.S. Business occurs within Individual Life.
    The major products in this area are:

Variable Life.

Variable life products provide
    insurance coverage through a contract that gives the
    policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on
    the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with
    certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life
    products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the
    policyholder into a variety of separate accounts or directed to
    the Company’s general account. In the separate accounts,
    the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment
    results. We collect specified fees for the management of these
    various investment accounts and any net return is credited
    directly to the policyholder’s account. In some instances,
    third-party money management firms manage investment accounts
    that support variable insurance products. With some products, by
    maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the
    advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death
    benefit from adverse investment experience.



Universal Life.

Universal life products
    provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life,
    except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances,
    are allocated only to the Company’s general account.
    Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or
    decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of
    the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of
    premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained
    for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified
    expenses. Interest is credited to the policyholder’s
    account at interest rates we determine, subject to specified
    minimums. Specific charges are made against the
    policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection
    and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain
    premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Term Life.

Term life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified
    time period in return for the periodic payment of premiums.
    Specified coverage periods range from one year to 30 years,
    but in no event are they longer than the period over which
    premiums are paid. Death benefits may be level over the period
    or decreasing. Decreasing coverage is used principally to
    provide for loan repayment in the event of death. Premiums may
    be guaranteed at a level amount for the coverage period or may
    be non-level and non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are
    sometimes referred to as pure protection products, in that there
    are typically no savings or investment elements. Term contracts
    expire without value at the end of the coverage period when the
    insured party is still living.

Whole Life.

Whole life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for
    the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined
    period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of
    the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be
    level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
    Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a
    participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders
    may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death
    benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or
    reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.
    Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder,
    this group of products provides significant flexibility to
    individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs
    and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed
    benefits.

Our Non-Medical Health insurance products and services include
    dental insurance, group short- and long-term disability,
    individual disability income, long-term care (“LTC”),
    critical illness and accidental death & dismemberment
    coverages. Other products and services include
    employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance provided
    through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid legal
    plans. We also sell administrative services-only
    (“ASO”) arrangements to some employers. The major
    products in this area are:

Dental.

Dental products provide insurance and
    ASO plans that assist employees, retirees and their families in
    maintaining oral health while reducing

out-of-pocket

expenses and providing superior customer service. Dental plans
    include the Preferred Dentist Program and the Dental Health
    Maintenance Organization.

Disability.

Disability products provide a
    benefit in the event of the disability of the insured. In most
    instances, this benefit is in the form of monthly income paid
    until the insured reaches age 65. In addition to income
    replacement, the product may be used to provide for the payment
    of business overhead expenses for disabled business owners or
    mortgage payment protection. This is offered on both a group and
    individual basis.

Long-term Care.

LTC products provide a fixed
    benefit amount on a daily or monthly basis for individuals who
    need assistance with activities of daily living or have a
    cognitive impairment. These products are offered on both a group
    and individual basis.

Retirement
    Products

Our Retirement products segment includes a variety of variable
    and fixed annuities that are primarily sold to individuals and
    employees of corporations and other institutions. The major
    products in this area are:

Variable Annuities.

Variable annuities provide
    for both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs.
    Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make deposits
    into various investment accounts, as determined by the
    contractholder. The investment accounts are separate accounts
    and risks associated with such investments are borne entirely by
    the contractholder, except where guaranteed minimum benefits are



involved. In certain variable annuity products, contractholders
    may also choose to allocate all or a portion of their account to
    the Company’s general account and are credited with
    interest at rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. In
    addition, contractholders may also elect certain minimum death
    benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for which
    additional fees are charged.

Fixed Annuities.

Fixed annuities provide for
    both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed
    annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided
    by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the
    preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made
    into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited
    interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited
    periods of time, ranging from one to ten years. Fixed income
    annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
    period of years

and/or

for
    the life of the annuitant.

Corporate
    Benefit Funding

Our Corporate Benefit Funding segment includes an array of
    annuity and investment products, including, guaranteed interest
    products and other stable value products, income annuities, and
    separate account contracts for the investment management of
    defined benefit and defined contribution plan assets. This
    segment also includes certain products to fund postretirement
    benefits and company, bank or trust owned life insurance used to
    finance non-qualified benefit programs for executives. The major
    products in this area are:

Stable Value Products.

We offer general
    account guaranteed interest contracts, separate account
    guaranteed interest contracts, and similar products used to
    support the stable value option of defined contribution plans.
    We also offer private floating rate funding agreements that are
    used for money market funds, securities lending cash collateral
    portfolios and short-term investment funds.

Pensions Closeouts.

We offer general account
    and separate account annuity products, generally in connection
    with the termination of defined benefit pension plans, both
    domestically and in the United Kingdom. We also offer
    partial risk transfer solutions that allow for partial transfers
    of pension liabilities. Annuity products include single premium
    buyouts and terminal funding contracts.

Torts and Settlements.

We offer innovative
    strategies for complex litigation settlements, primarily
    structured settlement annuities.

Capital Markets Investment Products.

Products
    offered include funding agreements (including our Global GIC
    Programs), Federal Home Loan Bank advances and funding agreement
    backed commercial paper.

Other Corporate Benefit Funding Products and
    Services.

We offer specialized life insurance
    products designed specifically to provide solutions for
    non-qualified benefit and retiree benefit funding purposes.

Auto &
    Home

Our Auto & Home segment includes personal lines
    property and casualty insurance offered directly to employees at
    their employer’s worksite, as well as to individuals
    through a variety of retail distribution channels, including
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists, direct
    response marketing and the agency distribution group.
    Auto & Home primarily sells auto insurance, which
    represented 68% of Auto & Home’s total net earned
    premiums in 2009. Homeowners and other insurance represented 32%
    of Auto & Home’s total net earned premiums in
    2009. The major products in this area are:

Auto Coverages.

Auto insurance policies
    provide coverage for private passenger automobiles, utility
    automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or
    classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers
    traditional coverage such as liability, uninsured motorist, no
    fault or personal injury protection and collision and
    comprehensive.

Homeowners and Other
    Coverages.

Homeowners’ insurance policies
    provide protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners
    and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage
    to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well
    as coverage for liability arising from ownership



or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal excess liability
    (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other
    liability insurance policies), and coverage for recreational
    vehicles and boat owners.

Traditional insurance policies for dwellings represent the
    majority of Auto & Home’s homeowners’
    policies providing protection for loss on a “replacement
    cost” basis. These policies provide additional coverage for
    reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders
    that have been displaced from their homes.

Sales
    Distribution

Our U.S. Business markets our products and services through
    various distribution groups. Our life insurance and retirement
    products targeted to individuals are sold via sales forces,
    comprised of MetLife employees, in addition to third-party
    organizations. Our group life and non-medical health insurance
    and corporate benefit funding products are sold via sales forces
    primarily comprised of MetLife employees. Personal lines
    property and casualty insurance products are directly marketed
    to employees at their employer’s worksite. Auto &
    Home products are also marketed and sold to individuals by
    independent agents and property and casualty specialists through
    a direct response channel and the agency distribution group.
    MetLife sales employees work with all distribution groups to
    better reach and service customers, brokers, consultants and
    other intermediaries.

Individual
    Sales Distribution

Our individual distribution targets the large middle-income
    market, as well as affluent individuals, owners of small
    businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies.
    We have also been successful in selling our products in various
    multi-cultural markets.

Insurance Products are sold through our individual sales
    distribution organization and also through various third-party
    organizations utilizing two models. In the coverage model,
    wholesalers sell to high net worth individuals and small- to
    medium-sized businesses through independent general agencies,
    financial advisors, consultants, brokerage general agencies and
    other independent marketing organizations under contractual
    arrangements. Wholesalers sell through financial intermediaries,
    including regional broker-dealers, brokerage firms, financial
    planners and banks.

Retirement Products are sold through our individual sales
    distribution organization and also through various third-party
    organizations such as regional broker-dealers, New York Stock
    Exchange (“NYSE”) brokerage firms, financial planners
    and banks.

Individual sales distribution representatives market
    Auto & Home products to individuals through a variety
    of means.

The individual sales distribution organization is comprised of
    three channels: the MetLife distribution channel, a career
    agency system, the New England financial distribution channel, a
    general agency system, and MetLife Resources, a career agency
    system.

The MetLife distribution channel had 5,762 MetLife agents under
    contract in 82 agencies at December 31, 2009. The career
    agency sales force focuses on the large middle-income and
    affluent markets, including multi-cultural markets. We support
    our efforts in multi-cultural markets through targeted
    advertising, specially trained agents and sales literature
    written in various languages.

The New England financial distribution channel included 36
    general agencies providing support to 2,232 general agents and a
    network of independent brokers throughout the United States at
    December 31, 2009. The New England financial distribution
    channel targets high net worth individuals, owners of small
    businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies.

MetLife Resources, a focused distribution channel of MetLife,
    markets retirement, annuity and other financial products on a
    national basis through 621 MetLife agents and independent
    brokers at December 31, 2009. MetLife Resources targets the
    nonprofit, educational and healthcare markets.



We market and sell Auto & Home products through
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists, a direct
    response channel and the agency distribution group. In recent
    years, we have increased the number of independent agents
    appointed to sell these products.

In 2009, Auto & Home’s business was concentrated
    in the following states, as measured by amount and percentage of
    total direct earned premiums:

Group
    Sales Distribution

Insurance Products distributes its group life and non-medical
    health insurance products and services through a sales force
    that is segmented by the size of the target customer. Marketing
    representatives sell either directly to corporate and other
    group customers or through an intermediary, such as a broker or
    consultant. Voluntary products are sold through the same sales
    channels, as well as by specialists for these products.
    Employers have been emphasizing such voluntary products and, as
    a result, we have increased our focus on communicating and
    marketing to such employees in order to further foster sales of
    those products. At December 31, 2009, the group life and
    non-medical health insurance sales channels had 385 marketing
    representatives.

Retirement Products markets its retirement, savings, investment
    and payout annuity products and services to sponsors and
    advisors of benefit plans of all sizes. These products and
    services are offered to private and public pension plans,
    collective bargaining units, nonprofit organizations, recipients
    of structured settlements and the current and retired members of
    these and other institutions.

Corporate Benefit Funding products and services are distributed
    through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers located
    in 12 offices around the country. In addition, the
    retirement & benefits funding organization works with
    individual distribution and group life and non-medical health
    insurance distribution areas to better reach and service
    customers, brokers, consultants and other intermediaries.

Auto & Home is a leading provider of personal lines
    property and casualty insurance products offered to employees at
    their employer’s worksite. At December 31, 2009, 2,223
    employers offered MetLife Auto & Home products to
    their employees.

Group marketing representatives market personal lines property
    and casualty insurance products to employers through a variety
    of means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to group
    customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife commences
    marketing efforts to employees. Employees who are interested in
    the auto and homeowners products can call a toll-free number to
    request a quote to purchase coverage and to request payroll
    deduction over the telephone. Auto & Home has also
    developed a proprietary software that permits an employee in
    most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance through
    Auto & Home’s Internet website.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
    arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and
    distribution opportunities of group products and services. We
    also seek to sell our group products and services through
    sponsoring organizations and affinity groups. For example, we
    are the provider of LTC products for the National Long-Term Care
    Coalition, a group of some of the nation’s largest
    employers. In addition, we also provide life and dental coverage
    to federal employees.



International

Overview

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and
    retirement & savings products to both individuals and
    groups. We focus on emerging markets primarily within the Latin
    America, Asia Pacific and EMEI regions. We operate in
    international markets through subsidiaries and joint ventures.
    See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could
    Negatively Affect Our Profitability,” and “Risk
    Factors — Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability,” and
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Latin
    America Region

We operate in the Latin America region in Mexico, Chile, Brazil,
    Argentina, and Uruguay. The operations in Mexico and Chile
    represented 83% of the total premiums and fees in this region
    for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Mexican operation
    is the largest life insurance company in both the individual and
    group businesses in Mexico according to Asociación Mexicana
    de Instituciones de Seguro, a Mexican industry trade group which
    provides ranking for insurance companies. The Chilean operation
    is the second largest annuity company in Chile, based on market
    share according to Superintendencia Valores y Seguros, the
    Chilean insurance regulator. The Chilean operation also offers
    individual life insurance and group insurance products. We also
    actively market individual life insurance, group insurance
    products and credit life coverage in Argentina, but the
    nationalization of the pension system substantially reduced our
    presence in Argentina. The business environment in Argentina has
    been, and may continue to be, affected by governmental and legal
    actions which impact our results of operations.

Asia
    Pacific Region

We operate in the Asia Pacific region in South Korea, Hong Kong,
    Taiwan, Australia, Japan, and China. The activities in the
    region are primarily focused on individual business. The
    operations in South Korea and Hong Kong represented 63% of the
    total premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. The South Korean operation has
    significant sales of variable universal life and annuity
    products. The Hong Kong operation has significant sales of
    variable universal life and endowment products. The Japanese
    joint venture operation offers fixed and guaranteed variable
    annuities and variable life products. We have a quota share
    reinsurance agreement with the joint venture in Japan, whereby
    we assume 100% of the living and death guarantee benefits
    associated with the variable annuity business written after
    April 2005 by the joint venture. The operating results of the
    joint venture operations in Japan and China are reflected in net
    investment income and are not consolidated in the financial
    results.

Europe,
    Middle East and India Region

We operate in Europe in the United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland and
    Ireland. The results of our operations in the Middle East and
    our consolidated joint venture in India are also included in our
    EMEI region. The operations in the United Kingdom and India
    represented 72% of the total premiums and fees in this region
    for the year ended December 31, 2009. The United Kingdom
    operation underwrites risk in its home market and fourteen other
    countries across Europe and the Middle East offering credit
    insurance coverage. The Indian operation has significant sales
    of unit-linked and traditional life insurance products.

Banking,
    Corporate & Other

Banking, Corporate & Other contains the excess capital
    not allocated to the business segments, which is invested to
    optimize investment spread and to fund company initiatives,
    various

start-up

entities, and run-off entities. Banking, Corporate &
    Other also includes interest expense related to the majority of
    our outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings. The elimination of transactions from activity
    between U.S. Business, International, and Banking,
    Corporate & Other occurs within Banking,
    Corporate & Other.



Banking, Corporate & Other also includes the financial
    results of MetLife Bank, which offers a variety of residential
    mortgage and deposit products. The residential mortgage banking
    activities include the origination and servicing of mortgage
    loans. Mortgage loans are

held-for-investment

or sold primarily into Federal National Mortgage Association
    (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    (“FHLMC”) or Government National Mortgage Association
    (“GNMA”) securities. MetLife Bank also leverages
    MetLife’s investment platform to source commercial and
    agriculture loans as investments on its balance sheet. MetLife
    Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal
    Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”) and is subject to
    regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the
    Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and secondarily by
    the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and
    the Federal Reserve.

Products offered by MetLife Bank include forward and reverse
    residential mortgage loans and consumer deposits. Residential
    mortgage loans are originated through MetLife Bank’s
    national sales force, mortgage brokers and mortgage
    correspondents. In addition, MetLife Bank principally seeks
    deposits from direct customers via the Internet and mail, as
    well as customers of its affiliates having access to
    affiliates’ distribution channels and field force,
    including through voluntary benefits platforms.

The origination of forward and reverse mortgage single family
    loans include both variable and fixed rate products. MetLife
    Bank does not originate

sub-prime

or
    alternative residential mortgage loans (“Alt-A”)
    mortgage loans and the funding for the mortgage banking
    activities is provided by deposits and borrowings.

Deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money
    market savings accounts, certificates of deposit
    (“CDs”) and individual retirement accounts. MetLife
    Bank participates in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry
    Service program through which certain customer CDs are exchanged
    for CDs of similar amounts from participating banks. The deposit
    products provide a relatively stable source of funding and
    liquidity and are used to fund securities and loans.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined
    amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when
    a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes
    disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to
    provide for future annuity payments. We compute the amounts for
    actuarial liabilities reported in our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). For
    more details on Policyholder Liabilities see
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of
    Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Future
    Policy Benefits” and “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Policyholder Liabilities.”

Pursuant to state insurance laws, the Holding Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries establish statutory reserves, reported as
    liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective
    policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts
    sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken
    together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed
    rates. Statutory reserves generally differ from actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits determined using GAAP.

The New York Insurance Law and regulations require certain
    MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of
    Insurance or other state insurance departments, with each annual
    report, an opinion and memorandum of a “qualified
    actuary” that the statutory reserves and related actuarial
    amounts recorded in support of specified policies and contracts,
    and the assets supporting such statutory reserves and related
    actuarial amounts, make adequate provision for their statutory
    liabilities with respect to these obligations. See
    “— Regulation — Insurance Regulation
    — Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.”

Underwriting
    and Pricing

Underwriting

Underwriting generally involves an evaluation of applications
    for Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit
    Funding, and Auto & Home by a professional staff of
    underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the
    amount of risk that we are willing to accept. In addition to the
    products described above, the International segment, also offers
    credit insurance and in a limited number of countries, major
    medical products. We



employ detailed underwriting policies, guidelines and procedures
    designed to assist the underwriter to properly assess and
    quantify risks before issuing policies to qualified applicants
    or groups.

Insurance underwriting considers not only an applicant’s
    medical history, but also other factors such as financial
    profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco
    use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk
    characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with
    certain voluntary products, employees may be underwritten on an
    individual basis. We generally perform our own underwriting;
    however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under
    guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to
    accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or
    group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for
    coverage are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is
    not issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined
    and approved by our underwriters.

Our remote underwriting offices, intermediaries, as well as our
    corporate underwriting office are periodically reviewed via
    continuous on-going internal underwriting audits to maintain
    high-standards of underwriting and consistency across the
    Company. Such offices are also subject to periodic external
    audits by reinsurers with whom we do business.

We have established senior level oversight of the underwriting
    process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of
    our customers, while supporting our financial strength and
    business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting,
    mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in
    our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and
    establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and
    strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer,
    the agent and us.

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six
    principal aspects: evaluating potential worksite marketing
    employer accounts and independent agencies; establishing
    guidelines for the binding of risks; reviewing coverage bound by
    agents; underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case
    basis, presented by agents outside the scope of their binding
    authority; pursuing information necessary in certain cases to
    enable Auto & Home to issue a policy within our
    guidelines; and ensuring that renewal policies continue to be
    written at rates commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of the
    U.S. Business distribution channels have binding authority
    for risks which fall within its published underwriting
    guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting guidelines
    may be submitted for approval to the underwriting department;
    alternatively, agents in such a situation may call the
    underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the risk
    themselves. In most states, the Company generally has the right
    within a specified period (usually the first 60 days) to
    cancel any policy.

Pricing

Pricing has traditionally reflected our corporate underwriting
    standards. Product pricing is based on the expected payout of
    benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for
    mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment
    returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as
    inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based on
    various factors, which may include investment return, expenses,
    persistency and optionality. For certain investment oriented
    products in the U.S. and certain business sold
    internationally, pricing may include prospective and
    retrospective experience rating features. Prospective experience
    rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the
    purpose of determining future premium rates and all prior year
    gains and losses are borne by the Company. Retrospective
    experience rating also involves the evaluation of past
    experience for the purpose of determining the actual cost of
    providing insurance for the customer, however, the contract
    includes certain features that allow the Company to recoup
    certain losses or distribute certain gains back to the
    policyholder based on actual prior years’ experience.

Rates for group life and non-medical health products are based
    on anticipated results for the book of business being
    underwritten. Renewals are generally reevaluated annually or
    biannually and are repriced to reflect actual experience on such
    products. Products offered by CBF are priced frequently and are
    very responsive to bond yields, and such prices include
    additional margin in periods of market uncertainty. This
    business is predominantly illiquid, because policyholders have
    no contractual rights to cash values and no options to change
    the form of the product’s benefits.



Rates for individual life insurance products are highly
    regulated and must be approved by the state regulators where the
    product is sold. Generally such products are renewed annually
    and may include pricing terms that are guaranteed for a certain
    period of time. Fixed and variable annuity products are also
    highly regulated and approved by the individual state
    regulators. Such products generally include penalties for early
    withdrawals and policyholder benefit elections to tailor the
    form of the product’s benefits to the needs of the opting
    policyholder. The Company periodically reevaluates the costs
    associated with such options and will periodically adjust
    pricing levels on its guarantees. Further, the Company from time
    to time may also reevaluate the type and level of guarantee
    features currently being offered.

Rates for Auto & Home’s major lines of insurance
    are based on its proprietary database, rather than relying on
    rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in part
    from a number of variables specific to each risk. The pricing of
    personal lines insurance products takes into account, among
    other things, the expected frequency and severity of losses, the
    costs of providing coverage (including the costs of acquiring
    policyholders and administering policy benefits and other
    administrative and overhead costs), competitive factors and
    profit considerations. The major pricing variables for personal
    lines insurance include characteristics of the insured property,
    such as age, make and model or construction type, as well as
    characteristics of the insureds, such as driving record and loss
    experience, and the insured’s personal financial
    management. Auto & Home’s ability to set and
    change rates is subject to regulatory oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state,
    Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is
    required to write or share the cost of private passenger
    automobile insurance for higher risk individuals who would
    otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This
    “involuntary” market, also called the “shared
    market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations
    of each state, and policies written in this market are generally
    written at rates higher than standard rates.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. The current
    economic environment, with its volatility and uncertainty is not
    expected to materially impact the pricing of our products.

Reinsurance
    Activity

We enter into various agreements with reinsurers that cover
    individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of business,
    primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or
    catastrophe excess basis. These reinsurance agreements spread
    risk and minimize the effect of losses. The extent of each risk
    retained by us depends on our evaluation of the specific risk,
    subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum retention limits
    based on the characteristics of coverages. We also cede first
    dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. In addition to
    reinsuring mortality risk, we reinsure other risks, as well as
    specific coverages. We routinely reinsure certain classes of
    risks in order to limit our exposure to particular travel,
    avocation and lifestyle hazards. We obtain reinsurance for
    capital requirement purposes and also when the economic impact
    of the reinsurance agreement makes it appropriate to do so.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer
    agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event a claim
    is paid. However, we remain liable to our policyholders with
    respect to ceded reinsurance should any reinsurer be unable to
    meet its obligations under these agreements. Since we bear the
    risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we
    primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated
    reinsurers. We analyze recent trends in arbitration and
    litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers. We
    monitor ratings and evaluate the financial strength of our
    reinsurers by analyzing their financial statements. In addition,
    the reinsurance recoverable balance due from each reinsurer is
    evaluated as part of the overall monitoring process.
    Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances are evaluated
    based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance
    recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including
    secured trusts, funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters
    of credit.

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of
    reinsurers. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreements,
    reinsurance balances recoverable could become uncollectible.
    Cessions under reinsurance arrangements do not discharge our
    obligations as the primary insurer.



U.S.
    Business

Our Insurance Products segment participates in reinsurance
    activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to
    significant risks, and provide additional capacity for future
    growth. For our individual life insurance products, we have
    historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess
    of retention basis or a quota share basis. Until 2005, we
    reinsured up to 90% of the mortality risk for all new individual
    life insurance policies that we wrote through our various
    subsidiaries. During 2005, we changed our retention practices
    for certain individual life insurance policies. Under the new
    retention guidelines, we reinsure up to 90% of the mortality
    risk in excess of $1 million. Retention limits remain
    unchanged for other new individual life insurance policies.
    Policies reinsured in years prior to 2005 remain reinsured under
    the original reinsurance agreements. On a case by case basis, we
    may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of
    amounts in excess of our retention limits. We evaluate our
    reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our
    retention at any time. Placement of reinsurance is done
    primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis
    for risks with specific characteristics.

For other policies within the Insurance Products segment, we
    generally retain most of the risk and only cede particular risks
    on certain client arrangements.

Our Retirement Products segment reinsures a portion of the
    living and death benefit guarantees issued in connection with
    our variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, we
    pay a reinsurance premium generally based on fees associated
    with the guarantees collected from policyholders, and receive
    reimbursement for benefits paid or accrued in excess of account
    values, subject to certain limitations. We enter into similar
    agreements for new or in-force business depending on market
    conditions.

Our Corporate Benefit Funding segment has periodically engaged
    in reinsurance activities, as considered appropriate.

Our Auto & Home segment purchases reinsurance to
    manage its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe
    losses) and to protect statutory surplus. We cede to reinsurers
    a portion of losses and premiums based upon the exposure of the
    policies subject to reinsurance. To manage exposure to large
    property and casualty losses, we utilize property catastrophe,
    casualty and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

International

Our International segment has periodically engaged in
    reinsurance activities, as considered appropriate.

Banking,
    Corporate & Other

We also reinsure through 100% quota share reinsurance agreements
    certain run-off long-term care and workers’ compensation
    business written by MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut
    (“MICC”), a subsidiary of the Company.

Catastrophe
    Coverage

We have exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute to
    significant fluctuations in our results of operations. We use
    excess of retention and quota share reinsurance arrangements to
    provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to
    larger risks.

    balances, included in premiums and other receivables in the
    consolidated balance sheets, see Note 9 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Regulation

Insurance
    Regulation

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is licensed to transact
    insurance business in, and is subject to regulation and
    supervision by, all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
    Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands and



Northern Mariana Islands. Each of MetLife’s insurance
    subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each U.S. and
    international jurisdiction where they conduct insurance
    business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most
    jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial
    aspects of insurers, including standards of solvency, statutory
    reserves, reinsurance and capital adequacy, and the business
    conduct of insurers. In addition, statutes and regulations
    usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the
    approval of policy forms and certain other related materials
    and, for certain lines of insurance, the approval of rates. Such
    statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and
    concentration of investments. New York Insurance Law limits the
    amount of compensation that insurers doing business in New York
    may pay to their agents, as well as the amount of total
    expenses, including sales commissions and marketing expenses,
    that such insurers may incur in connection with the sale of life
    insurance policies and annuity contracts throughout the United
    States.

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally
    including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance
    regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it
    does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to
    periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries
    must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of
    insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms
    relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which
    they operate.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) has established a program of accrediting
    state insurance departments. NAIC accreditation contemplates
    that accredited states will conduct periodic examinations of
    insurers domiciled in such states. NAIC-accredited states will
    not accept reports of examination of insurers from unaccredited
    states, except under limited circumstances. As a direct result,
    insurers domiciled in unaccredited states may be subject to
    financial examination by accredited states in which they are
    licensed, in addition to any examinations conducted by their
    domiciliary states. In 2009, the New York State Department of
    Insurance (the “Department”), MLIC’s principal
    insurance regulator, received accreditation from the NAIC.
    Previously, the Department was not accredited by the NAIC, but
    the absence of this accreditation did not have a significant
    impact upon our ability to conduct our insurance businesses.

State and federal insurance and securities regulatory
    authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and
    attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding
    compliance by the Holding Company and its insurance subsidiaries
    with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations
    regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities
    businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective
    action when warranted. See Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Holding Company Regulation.

The Holding
    Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation
    under the insurance holding company laws of various
    jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and
    regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but
    generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that
    are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register
    with state regulatory authorities and to file with those
    authorities certain reports, including information concerning
    its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
    intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
    companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its
    affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Dividends from Subsidiaries.” The New York Insurance Law
    and the regulations thereunder also restrict the aggregate
    amount of investments MLIC may make in non-life insurance
    subsidiaries, and provide for detailed periodic reporting on
    subsidiaries.

Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.

Most of the jurisdictions in which
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are admitted to
    transact business require life and property and casualty
    insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate
    in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain
    contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets.



In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against
    MetLife have not been material. We have established liabilities
    for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate for
    assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject
    to insolvency proceedings. See Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    the insolvency assessments.

Statutory Insurance Examination.

As part of
    their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments
    conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records,
    accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
    states. State insurance departments also have the authority to
    conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are
    licensed in their states. During the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2009, MetLife has not received any material
    adverse findings resulting from state insurance department
    examinations of its insurance subsidiaries conducted during this
    three-year period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states and Financial
    Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC,
    MetLife Securities, Inc., New England Mutual Life Insurance
    Company, New England Life Insurance Company, New England
    Securities Corporation, General American Life Insurance Company,
    Walnut Street Securities, Inc., MICC and Tower Square
    Securities, Inc. Over the past several years, these and a number
    of investigations by other regulatory authorities were resolved
    for monetary payments and certain other relief. We may continue
    to resolve investigations in a similar manner. See Note 16
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.

Annually, MetLife’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct an
    analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each
    case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states
    that the statutory reserves, when considered in light of the
    assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and
    sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations
    and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot
    be provided, the insurer must set up additional reserves by
    moving funds from surplus. Since inception of this requirement,
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries which are required by
    their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided
    such opinions without qualifications.

Surplus and Capital.

The Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision
    of the regulators in each jurisdiction in which they are
    licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary
    authority, in connection with the continued licensing of these
    insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit sales to
    policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine
    that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or
    capital or that the further transaction of business will be
    hazardous to policyholders. See “— Risk-Based
    Capital.”

Risk-Based Capital
    (“

RBC

”).

Each of the
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to
    RBC requirements and reports its RBC based on a formula
    calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and
    statutory reserve items, as well as taking into account the risk
    characteristics of the insurer. The major categories of risk
    involved are asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk,
    market risk and business risk. The formula is used as an early
    warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately
    capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory
    action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. State
    insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to
    require various actions by, or take various actions against,
    insurers whose RBC ratio does not meet or exceed certain RBC
    levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC of
    each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC
    levels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company
    — Capital.”

The NAIC provides standardized insurance industry accounting and
    reporting guidance through its Accounting Practices and
    Procedures Manual (the “Manual”). However, statutory
    accounting principles continue to be established by individual
    state laws, regulations and permitted practices. The Department
    has adopted the Manual with certain modifications for the
    preparation of statutory financial statements of insurance
    companies domiciled in New York. Changes to the Manual or
    modifications by the various state insurance departments may
    impact the statutory capital and surplus of the Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries.



Regulation of Investments.

Each of the
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    state laws and regulations that require diversification of its
    investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in
    certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed
    income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments,
    and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and
    regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory
    limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of
    measuring surplus, and, in some instances, would require
    divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that
    the investments made by each of the Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such
    regulations at December 31, 2009.

Federal Initiatives.

Although the federal
    government generally does not directly regulate the insurance
    business, federal initiatives often have an impact on our
    business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal
    measures are proposed which may significantly affect the
    insurance business. In addition, various forms of direct and
    indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from
    time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an
    optional federal charter for insurance companies. As part of a
    proposed comprehensive reform of financial services regulation,
    Congress is considering the creation of an office within the
    federal government to collect information about the insurance
    industry, recommend prudential standards, and represent the
    United States in dealings with foreign insurance regulators. See
    “Risk Factors — Our Insurance and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth.”

Legislative Developments.

As part of their
    proposed financial services regulatory reform legislation, the
    Obama Administration and Congress have made various proposals
    that would change the capital and liquidity requirements, credit
    exposure concentrations and similar prudential matters for bank
    holding companies, banks and other financial firms. For example:

•

Bank regulatory agencies have issued proposed interagency
    guidance for funding and liquidity risk management that would
    apply to MetLife as a bank holding company.

•

The proposals under consideration in Congress also include
    special regulatory and insolvency regimes, including even higher
    capital and liquidity standards, for financial institutions that
    are deemed to be systemically significant. These insolvency
    regimes could vary from the resolution regimes currently
    applicable to some subsidiaries of such companies and could
    include assessments on financial companies to provide for a
    systemic resolution fund.

•

The Obama Administration, members of Congress and Federal
    banking regulators have suggested new or increased taxes or
    assessments on banks and financial firms to mitigate the costs
    to taxpayers of various government programs established to
    address the financial crisis and to offset the costs of
    potential future crises.

•

The proposed legislation also includes new conditions on the
    writing and trading of certain standardized and non-standardized
    derivatives.

Congress is also considering establishing a new governmental
    agency that would supervise and regulate institutions that
    provide certain financial products and services to consumers.
    Although the consumer financial services to which this
    legislation would apply might exclude certain insurance
    business, the new agency would have authority to regulate
    consumer services provided by MetLife Bank. The proposed
    legislation may also eliminate or significantly restrict federal
    pre-emption of state consumer protection laws applicable to
    banking services, which would increase the regulatory and
    compliance burden on MetLife Bank and could adversely affect its
    business and results of operations. We cannot predict whether
    these or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if
    any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations or on our
    dealings with other financial institutions. See “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are
    Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what
    legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any
    such legislation on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.



Governmental
    Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions

U.S. Federal Governmental
    Responses.

Throughout 2008 and continuing in
    2009, Congress, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
    U.S. Treasury and other agencies of the Federal government
    took a number of increasingly aggressive actions (in addition to
    continuing a series of interest rate reductions that began in
    the second half of 2007) intended to provide liquidity to
    financial institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor
    confidence in particular troubled institutions and to prevent or
    contain the spread of the financial crisis. These measures
    included:

•

expanding the types of institutions that have access to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s discount window;

•

providing asset guarantees and emergency loans to particular
    distressed companies;

•

a temporary ban on short selling of shares of certain financial
    institutions (including, for a period, MetLife);

•

programs intended to reduce the volume of mortgage foreclosures
    by modifying the terms of mortgage loans for distressed
    borrowers;

•

temporarily guaranteeing money market funds; and

•

programs to support the mortgage-backed securities market and
    mortgage lending.

In addition to these actions, pursuant to the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), enacted in October
    2008, the U.S. Treasury injected capital into selected
    financial institutions and their holding companies. EESA also
    authorizes the U.S. Treasury to purchase mortgage-backed
    and other securities from financial institutions as part of the
    overall $700 billion available for the purpose of
    stabilizing the financial markets. The Federal government, the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York, FDIC and other governmental
    and regulatory bodies also took other actions to address the
    financial crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York made funds available to commercial and financial companies
    under a number of programs, including the Commercial Paper
    Funding Facility (the “CPFF”), and the FDIC
    established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the
    “FDIC Program”). In March 2009, MetLife, Inc. issued
    $397 million of senior notes guaranteed by the FDIC under
    the FDIC Program. The FDIC Program and the CPFF expired in late
    2009 and early 2010, respectively. During the period of its
    existence, the Company made limited use of the CPFF, and no
    amounts were outstanding under the CPFF at December 31,
    2009. In October 2009, the FDIC established a limited six-month
    emergency guarantee facility upon expiration of the FDIC
    Program. Participating entities can apply to the FDIC for
    permission to issue FDIC-guaranteed debt during the period
    beginning October 31, 2009 through April 30, 2010.

In February 2009, the Treasury Department outlined a financial
    stability plan with additional measures to provide capital
    relief to institutions holding troubled assets, including a
    capital assistance program for banks that have undergone a
    “stress test” (the “Capital Assistance
    Program”) and a public-private investment fund to purchase
    troubled assets from financial institutions. MetLife was
    eligible to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s Capital
    Purchase Program, a voluntary capital infusion program
    established under EESA, but elected not to participate in that
    program. MetLife took part in the “stress test” and
    was advised by the Federal Reserve in May 2009 that, based on
    the stress test’s economic scenarios and methodology,
    MetLife had adequate capital to sustain a further deterioration
    in the economy. The choices made by the U.S. Treasury in
    its distribution of amounts available under the EESA, the
    Capital Assistance Program and other programs could have the
    effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services
    industry more than others or providing advantages to some of our
    competitors. See “Risk Factors — Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability.”

In addition to the various measures to foster liquidity and
    recapitalize the banking sector, the Federal government also
    passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February
    2009 that provided for nearly $790 billion in additional
    federal spending, tax cuts and federal aid intended to spur
    economic activity.

MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible
    to sell assets to the U.S. Treasury under one or more of
    the programs established under EESA, and some of their assets
    may be among those the U.S. Treasury or the public-private
    investment partnership proposed by the U.S. Treasury offers
    to purchase, either directly or through auction. MetLife, Inc.
    and its affiliates may also be able to purchase assets under
    some of these programs,



including the public-private investment program and the Term
    Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which provides funding
    for the purchase of specified types of asset-backed securities.

MetLife Bank has the capacity to borrow from the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York’s Discount Window and from the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York under the Term Auction Facility. At
    December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding borrowings
    under the Term Auction Facility.

State Insurance Regulatory Responses.

In
    January 2009, the NAIC considered, but declined, a number of
    reserve and capital relief proposals made by the American
    Council of Life Insurers (the “ACLI”), acting on
    behalf of its member companies. However, notwithstanding that
    NAIC action, insurance companies had the right to approach the
    insurance regulator in their respective state of domicile and
    request relief. Several MetLife insurance entities requested and
    were granted relief, resulting in a beneficial impact on
    reserves and capital. During the latter part of 2009, the NAIC
    adopted a number of reserve and capital relief proposals made by
    the ACLI, acting on behalf of its member companies. These
    changes superseded the actions described above and have
    generally resulted in lower statutory reserve and capital
    requirements, effective December 31, 2009, for life
    insurance companies. We cannot quantify or project the impact on
    the competitive landscape of the reserve and capital relief
    granted or any subsequent regulatory relief that may be granted.

In late 2009, following rating agency downgrades of virtually
    all residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”)
    from certain vintages, the NAIC engaged PIMCO, a well-known
    investment management firm, to analyze approximately 20,000
    residential mortgage-backed securities held by insurers and
    evaluate the likely loss that holders of those securities would
    suffer in the event of a default. PIMCO’s analysis showed
    that the severity of expected losses on those securities
    evaluated that are held by our insurance companies was
    significantly less than would be implied by the rating
    agencies’ ratings of such securities. The NAIC incorporated
    the results of PIMCO’s analysis into the risk-based capital
    charges assigned to the evaluated securities, with a beneficial
    impact on the risk-based capital to our insurance subsidiaries.

In late 2009, the NAIC approved an adjustment, for year-end 2009
    only, to the mortgage experience adjustment factor (the
    “MEAF”), which is utilized in calculating the RBC
    charges that are assigned to commercial and agricultural
    mortgages held by our domestic insurers. The MEAF calculation
    includes the ratio of an insurer’s commercial and
    agricultural mortgage default experience to the industry average
    commercial and agricultural mortgage default experience and,
    prior to the adjustment, had a cap of 350% and a floor of 50% of
    an industry-wide base factor. As a result of the adjustment, the
    minimum adjustment factor was raised from 50% to 75% and the
    maximum adjustment factor was lowered from 350% to 125%, based
    on an insurer’s actual experience. As a result of our
    experience and the increase in the floor, the corresponding RBC
    charges of certain of our domestic insurers, including MLIC,
    increased. It is our understanding that the Capital Adequacy
    Task Force of the NAIC will monitor market conditions and
    progress on proposals that may result in modifying or extending
    the proposal beyond 2009. There can be no assurance that the
    short-term adjustment will continue beyond 2009.

In late 2009, the NAIC issued Statement of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“SSAP”) 10R (“SSAP 10R”). SSAP
    10R increased the amount of deferred tax assets that may be
    admitted on a statutory basis. The admission criteria for
    realizing the value of deferred tax assets was increased from a
    one year to a three year period. Further, the aggregate cap on
    deferred tax assets that may be admitted was increased from 10%
    to 15% of surplus. These changes increased the capital and
    surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, thereby positively
    impacting RBC at December 31, 2009. To temper this positive
    RBC impact, and as a temporary measure at December 31, 2009
    only, a 5% pre-tax RBC charge must be applied to the additional
    admitted deferred tax assets generated by SSAP 10R.

Foreign Governmental Responses.

In an effort
    to strengthen the financial condition of key financial
    institutions or avert their collapse, and to forestall or reduce
    the effects of reduced lending activity, a number of foreign
    governments have also taken actions similar to some of those
    taken by the U.S. Federal government, including injecting
    capital into domestic financial institutions in exchange for
    ownership stakes. We cannot predict whether these actions will
    achieve their intended purpose or how they will impact
    competition in the financial services industry.



Broker-Dealer
    and Securities Regulation

Some of the Company’s subsidiaries and their activities in
    offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to
    extensive regulation under the federal securities laws
    administered by the SEC. These subsidiaries issue variable
    annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through
    separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
    (the “Investment Company Act”). Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and
    variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts
    are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the “Securities Act”). Other subsidiaries are
    registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
    and are members of, and subject to, regulation by the FINRA.
    Further, some of the Company’s subsidiaries are registered
    as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment
    Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers
    Act”), and are also registered as investment advisers in
    various states, as applicable. Certain variable contract
    separate accounts sponsored by the Company’s subsidiaries
    are exempt from registration, but may be subject to other
    provisions of the federal securities laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA
    from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations
    regarding compliance by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries
    with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate
    with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action
    when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to protect investors in the securities markets and
    generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and
    enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the
    conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and
    regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and
    regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide
    investment advisory services, offer products similar to those
    described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental
    Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to
    extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also
    the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities
    and costs in connection with any required remediation of such
    properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies
    that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities.
    We routinely have environmental assessments performed with
    respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real
    property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide
    assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not
    arise. However, based on information currently available to us,
    we believe that any costs associated with compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of such
    properties will not have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

Employee
    Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”)
    Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit
    plans that are subject to ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities
    are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code,
    including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must
    perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan
    participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA
    and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to
    engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain
    relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable
    provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by
    the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”).

In

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v.

Harris Trust and Savings Bank (1993),

the
    U.S. Supreme Court held that certain assets in excess of
    amounts necessary to satisfy guaranteed obligations under a
    participating group annuity general account contract are
    “plan assets.” Therefore, these assets are subject to
    certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA, which requires
    fiduciaries to perform their duties solely in the interest of
    ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. On January 5,
    2000, the Secretary of Labor issued final regulations
    indicating, in cases where an insurer has issued a policy backed
    by the insurer’s general account to or for an employee
    benefit



plan, the extent to which assets of the insurer constitute plan
    assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply
    only with respect to a policy issued by an insurer on or before
    December 31, 1998 (“Transition Policy”). No
    person will generally be liable under ERISA or the Code for
    conduct occurring prior to July 5, 2001, where the basis of
    a claim is that insurance company general account assets
    constitute plan assets. An insurer issuing a new policy that is
    backed by its general account and is issued to or for an
    employee benefit plan after December 31, 1998 will
    generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under ERISA,
    unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so
    that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be
    considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These
    requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the
    employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must
    permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day
    notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s
    option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance
    (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a
    book value payment of such amount in annual installments with
    interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to
    ensure compliance with these regulations.

Banking
    Regulation

As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is
    subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and
    guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the
    business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as
    well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC, the
    Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Federal banking laws and
    regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s
    business and operations with respect to, among other things,
    chartering to carry on business as a bank; maintaining minimum
    capital ratios; capital management in relation to the
    bank’s assets; safety and soundness standards; loan loss
    and other statutory reserves; liquidity; financial reporting and
    disclosure standards; counterparty credit concentration;
    restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;
    lending limits; payment of interest; unfair or deceptive acts or
    practices; privacy; and bank holding company and bank change of
    control. The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for
    funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to
    depositors. Federal and state banking regulators regularly
    re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and
    their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the bank.

Financial
    Holding Company Regulation

Regulatory Agencies.

In connection with its
    acquisition of a federally-chartered commercial bank, MetLife,
    Inc. became a bank holding company and financial holding company
    on February 28, 2001. As such, the Holding Company is
    subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to inspection,
    examination, and supervision by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In addition, MetLife Bank is
    subject to regulation and examination primarily by the OCC and
    secondarily by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the FDIC.

Financial Holding Company Activities.

As a
    financial holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and
    investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to
    those that are “financial” in nature or
    “incidental” or “complementary” to such
    financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature
    include securities underwriting, dealing and market making,
    sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance
    underwriting and agency, merchant banking and activities that
    the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be closely related
    to banking. In addition, under the insurance company investment
    portfolio provision of the GLB Act, financial holding companies
    are authorized to make investments in other financial and
    non-financial companies, through their insurance subsidiaries,
    that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
    with state insurance law, provided the financial holding company
    does not routinely manage or operate such companies except as
    may be necessary to obtain a reasonable return on investment.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies
    — Capital.

MetLife, Inc. and MetLife
    Bank are subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines
    issued by the federal banking



regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies.
    The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to
    take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to
    institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At
    December 31, 2009, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank were in
    compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Consumer Protection
    Laws.

Numerous other federal and state laws also
    affect the Holding Company’s and MetLife Bank’s
    earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer
    protection laws. The GLB Act included consumer privacy
    provisions that, among other things, require disclosure of a
    financial institution’s privacy policy to customers. In
    addition, these provisions permit states to adopt more extensive
    privacy protections through legislation or regulation. As part
    of its consideration of comprehensive reform of financial
    services regulation, Congress is considering establishing a
    Consumer Financial Protection Agency, a new governmental agency
    that would supervise and regulate institutions that provide
    certain financial products and services to consumers. Although
    the consumer financial services to which this legislation would
    apply might exclude certain insurance business, the new agency
    would have authority to regulate consumer services provided by
    MetLife Bank. The proposed legislation may also eliminate or
    significantly restrict federal pre-emption of state consumer
    protection laws applicable to banking services, which would
    increase the regulatory and compliance burden on MetLife Bank
    and could adversely affect its business and results of
    operations.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Change of
    Control.

Because MetLife, Inc. is a financial
    holding company and bank holding company under the federal
    banking laws, no person may acquire control of MetLife, Inc.
    without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. A
    change of control is conclusively presumed upon acquisition of
    25% or more of any class of voting securities and rebuttably
    presumed upon acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting
    securities. Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.’s
    ownership of MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC would be
    required in connection with a change of control (generally
    presumed upon the acquisition of 10% or more of any class of
    voting securities) of MetLife, Inc.

Competition

We believe that competition faced by our business segments is
    based on a number of factors, including service, product
    features, scale, price, financial strength, claims-paying
    ratings, credit ratings, ebusiness capabilities and name
    recognition. We compete with a large number of other insurance
    companies, as well as non-insurance financial services
    companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for
    individual consumers, employer and other group customers as well
    as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment
    products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of
    products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to
    other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability
    ratings. Many of our insurance products are underwritten
    annually and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers
    may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors
    rather than renewing coverage with us.

We believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began
    in the latter half of 2008, its impact on the capital position
    of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and
    rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In
    particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted
    financial strength as the most significant differentiator from
    the perspective of some customers and certain distributors. We
    believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this
    environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its
    individual products through other financial institutions such as
    banks and broker-dealers. These distribution partners are
    currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of
    the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial
    market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the risk
    associated with certain variable annuity products and has led
    many companies in our industry to re-examine the pricing and
    features of the products they offer. The effects of current
    market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life
    insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate
    impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest
    companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the
    current circumstances.

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurance companies for sales
    representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other
    insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the
    basis of our financial



position, support services and compensation and product
    features. See “— U.S. Business —
    Sales Distribution.” We continue to undertake several
    initiatives to grow our career agency force, while continuing to
    enhance the efficiency and production of our existing sales
    force. We cannot provide assurance that these initiatives will
    succeed in attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of
    individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our
    results of operations and financial position could be materially
    adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and
    retaining agents.

Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation.
    Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory
    environment can affect our competitive position within the life
    insurance industry and within the broader financial services
    industry. See “— Regulation,” “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are
    Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and “Risk Factors
    — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities
    Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability.”

Company
    Ratings

Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of
    rating agencies, including A.M. Best Company
    (“A.M. Best”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”),
    Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    (“S&P”), regarding the ability of an insurance
    company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and
    contractholders. Credit ratings represent the opinions of rating
    agencies regarding an issuer’s ability to repay its
    indebtedness.

Rating
    Stability Indicators

Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable,” “negative”
    or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term
    trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a
    rating change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to
    indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a
    “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency from
    changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating
    agencies assign rating modifiers such as “CreditWatch”
    or “Under Review” to indicate their opinion regarding
    the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are
    generally assigned in connection with certain events such as
    potential mergers and acquisitions, or material changes in a
    company’s results, in order for the rating agencies to
    perform its analysis to fully determine the rating implications
    of the event. See “Risk Factors — A Downgrade or
    a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit
    Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.”

Rating
    Actions

Throughout 2009, A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s, and
    S&P maintained its outlook for the U.S. life insurance
    sector as negative. We believe the rating agencies have
    heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to such
    institutions, increased the frequency and scope of their credit
    reviews, and have requested additional information from the
    companies that they rate. In December 2009 and February 2010,
    Moody’s and Fitch, respectively, downgraded by one notch
    the insurer financial strength and credit ratings assigned to
    MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries and each raised the rating
    outlook from “negative” to “stable.” In
    February 2010, S&P and A.M. Best each placed the
    ratings of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries on
    “CreditWatch with negative implications” and



“Under Review with negative implications,”
    respectively, based on our disclosure of a potential
    acquisition. Our insurer financial strength ratings and credit
    ratings at the date of this filing are listed in the tables

The foregoing insurer financial strength ratings reflect each
    rating agency’s opinion of MLIC and the Holding
    Company’s other insurance subsidiaries’ financial
    characteristics with respect to their ability to pay obligations
    under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their
    terms, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of
    investors in the Holding Company’s securities. Credit
    ratings are opinions of each agency with respect to specific
    securities and contractual financial obligations and the
    issuer’s ability and willingness to meet those obligations
    when due. Neither insurer financial strength nor credit ratings
    are statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase,
    hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating
    should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

A ratings downgrade (or the potential for such a downgrade) of
    MLIC or any of the Holding Company’s other insurance
    subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, increase the
    number of policies surrendered and withdrawals by policyholders
    of cash values from their policies, adversely affect
    relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers
    and other distributors of our products and services, negatively
    impact new sales, and adversely affect our ability to compete
    and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition. See also
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” for a more complete description of the
    impact of a ratings downgrade.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Difficult
    Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy
    Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and
    Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in
    the Near Future

Our business and results of operations are materially affected
    by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy
    generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the
    world. The stress experienced by global capital markets that
    began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially
    increased during 2008 and into 2009. Concerns over the
    availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market,
    geopolitical issues, energy costs, inflation and a declining
    real estate market in the United States contributed to increased
    volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the
    markets in the near term. These factors, combined with declining
    business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment,
    precipitated a recession. Most economists believe this recession
    ended in the third quarter of 2009, when positive growth
    returned, and now expect positive growth will continue in 2010.
    However, the expected recovery is weaker than normal, and the
    unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time. In
    addition, the fixed-income markets have experienced a period of
    extreme volatility which negatively impacted market liquidity
    conditions. Initially, the concerns on the part of market
    participants were focused on the

sub-prime

segment of the mortgage-backed securities market. However, these
    concerns expanded to include a broad range of mortgage- and
    asset-backed and other fixed income securities, including those
    rated investment grade, the U.S. and international credit
    and interbank money markets generally, and a wide range of
    financial institutions and markets, asset classes and sectors.
    Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and
    have less opportunity for disposal. Domestic and international
    equity markets have also experienced heightened volatility and
    turmoil, with issuers (such as our company) that have exposure
    to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets particularly
    affected. These events and continued market upheavals may have
    an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large
    investment portfolio and are also dependent upon customer
    behavior. Our revenues are likely to decline in such
    circumstances and our profit margins could erode. In addition,
    in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the
    global credit crisis, we could incur significant capital or
    operating losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we
    are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.

We are a significant writer of variable annuity products. The
    account values of these products decrease as a result of
    downturns in capital markets. Decreases in account values reduce
    the fees generated by our variable annuity products, cause the
    amortization of deferred acquisition costs to accelerate and
    could increase the level of liabilities we must carry to support
    those variable annuities issued with any associated guarantees.

Factors such as consumer spending, business investment,
    government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital
    markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic
    environment and, ultimately, the amount and



profitability of our business. In an economic downturn
    characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower
    corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer
    spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products
    could be adversely affected. In addition, we may experience an
    elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of
    policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance
    premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse
    changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and
    could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition. The recent market turmoil
    has also raised the possibility of legislative, regulatory and
    governmental actions. We cannot predict whether or when such
    actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could
    have on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition. See “— Actions of the
    U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other
    Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and
    Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended
    Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive
    Position,”  “— Our Insurance and Banking
    Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth” and “— Competitive Factors May
    Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability”.

Adverse
    Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect
    Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Access to Capital and Cost
    of Capital

The capital and credit markets are sometimes subject to periods
    of extreme volatility and disruption. Such volatility and
    disruption could cause liquidity and credit capacity for certain
    issuers to be limited.

We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our
    debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities
    lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities.
    Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our
    operations, and our business will suffer. The principal sources
    of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations,
    deposit funds, and cash flow from our investment portfolio and
    assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily
    convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets
    also include short-term instruments such as repurchase
    agreements and commercial paper. Sources of capital in normal
    markets include long-term instruments, medium- and long-term
    debt, junior subordinated debt securities, capital securities
    and equity securities.

In the event market or other conditions have an adverse impact
    on our capital and liquidity beyond expectations and our current
    resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek
    additional financing. The availability of additional financing
    will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions,
    regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit,
    the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of
    credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings
    and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers
    or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or
    short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment
    losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to
    a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be
    impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take
    negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity
    may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be
    able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable
    terms, or at all.

Our liquidity requirements may change if, among other things, we
    are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on
    short notice under securities lending agreements.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit
    markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate
    our business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such
    market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely
    manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital
    requirements; and access the capital necessary to grow our
    business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital,
    issue different types of securities than we would otherwise,
    less effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor
    securities than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of
    capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly
    reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of operations,
    financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position
    could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the
    financial markets.



Actions
    of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
    Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and
    Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended
    Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive
    Position

In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system
    and financial markets and going concern threats to investment
    banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008,
    President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act
    of 2008 (“EESA”) into law. Pursuant to EESA, the
    U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things,
    purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other
    securities (including newly issued preferred shares and
    subordinated debt) from financial institutions for the purpose
    of stabilizing the financial markets. The U.S. federal
    government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the FDIC and
    other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are
    considering taking other actions to address the financial
    crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York made
    funds available to commercial and financial companies under a
    number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding
    Facility, which expired in early 2010. The U.S. Treasury
    has established programs based in part on EESA and in part on
    the separate authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the
    FDIC, to foster purchases from and by banks, insurance companies
    and other financial institutions of certain kinds of assets for
    which valuations have been low and markets weak. Some of the
    programs established by governmental and regulatory bodies have
    recently been discontinued or will be in the near term. We
    cannot predict what impact, if any, this could have on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition.

Although such actions appear to have provided some stability to
    the financial markets, our business, financial condition and
    results of operations and the trading price of our common stock
    could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that
    credit availability and prices for financial assets revert to
    their low levels of late 2008 and early 2009 or do not continue
    to improve. Furthermore, Congress has considered, and may
    consider in the future, legislative proposals that could impact
    the estimated fair value of mortgage loans, such as legislation
    that would permit bankruptcy courts to rewrite the terms of a
    mortgage contract, including reducing the principal balance of
    mortgage loans owed by bankrupt borrowers. If such legislation
    is enacted, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our
    non-agency prime RMBS holdings and could cause a ratings
    downgrade in such holdings which, in turn, would cause an
    increase in unrealized losses on such securities and increase
    the risk-based capital that we must hold to support such
    securities. See “ — We Are Exposed to Significant
    Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May Adversely Affect
    Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity,
    and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from Period to
    Period.” In addition, the U.S. federal government
    (including the FDIC) and private lenders have begun programs to
    reduce the monthly payment obligations of mortgagors

and/or

reduce the principal payable on residential mortgage loans. As a
    result, we may need to maintain or increase our engagement in
    similar activities in order to comply with program requirements
    and to remain competitive. We cannot predict whether the funds
    made available by the U.S. federal government and its
    agencies will be enough to continue stabilizing or to further
    revive the financial markets or, if additional amounts are
    necessary, whether Congress will be willing to make the
    necessary appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would
    be towards any such appropriations, or what additional
    requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any
    such additional funds.

President Obama has proposed a “Financial Crisis
    Responsibility Fee” which would be imposed on financial
    firms with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets.
    The fee is intended to recover the cost of the Troubled Assets
    Relief Program established under EESA, which the Obama
    Administration currently estimates will be $117 billion.
    The fee would be imposed annually on covered financial firms for
    at least ten years and possibly longer. As a bank holding
    company with more than $50 billion of consolidated assets,
    MetLife appears to be subject to the proposed fee. Full details
    of the proposed fee, the companies subject to it, and the manner
    in which it would be assessed have not yet been released, so we
    cannot estimate its financial impact on us. However, it is
    possible that the proposed fee could have a material adverse
    impact on our results of operations.

The choices made by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve
    Board and the FDIC in their distribution of amounts available
    under EESA and any of the proposed new asset purchase programs
    could have the effect of supporting some aspects of the
    financial services industry more than others. Some of our
    competitors have received, or may in the future receive, funding
    under one or more of the federal government’s capital
    infusion programs. This



could adversely affect our competitive position. See
    “ — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability.”

See also “— Proposals to Regulate Compensation,
    if Implemented, Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and
    Retaining Management and Other Employees with the Talent and
    Experience to Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively”
    and “— Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are
    Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth.”

Our
    Insurance and Banking Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and
    Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and
    Limit Our Growth

Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of
    insurance and other laws and regulations. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation.” State insurance laws regulate most aspects of
    our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance
    subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the
    states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they
    are licensed. Our

non-U.S. insurance

operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory
    authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and
    operate.

State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory
    authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among
    other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with
    statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;

•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through
    the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices,
    distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;

•

regulating advertising;

•

protecting privacy;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and
    solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and
    minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance
    policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions
    between affiliates; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess
    insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
    policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an
    assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have
    currently established for these potential liabilities may not be
    adequate. See “Business — Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and
    Similar Arrangements.”

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly

re-examine

existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies
    and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered
    the need for regulations

and/or

laws
    to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of
    investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York
    and in



other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation Disclosure
    Amendment to its Producers Licensing Model Act which, if adopted
    by the states, would require disclosure by agents or brokers to
    customers that insurers will compensate such agents or brokers
    for the placement of insurance and documented acknowledgement of
    this arrangement in cases where the customer also compensates
    the agent or broker. Several states have enacted laws similar to
    the NAIC amendment. Others have enacted laws or proposed
    disclosure regulations which, under differing circumstances,
    require disclosure of specific compensation earned by a producer
    on the sale of an insurance or annuity product. We cannot
    predict how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or
    alternative regulations or the extent to which these regulations
    may have a material adverse impact on our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly
    regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation
    and administrative policies in several areas can significantly
    and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include
    financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension
    regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform
    legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct
    and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed
    from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of
    an optional federal charter for insurance companies. As part of
    a proposed comprehensive reform of financial services
    regulation, Congress is considering the creation of an office
    within the federal government to collect information about the
    insurance industry, recommend prudential standards, and
    represent the United States in dealings with foreign insurance
    regulators.

Other aspects of financial services regulatory reform proposals
    that have been considered could affect our business. For example:

•

The Obama Administration and Congress have made various
    proposals that would change the capital and liquidity
    requirements, credit exposure concentrations and similar
    prudential matters for bank holding companies, banks and other
    financial firms.

•

Bank regulatory agencies have issued proposed interagency
    guidance for funding and liquidity risk management that would
    apply to MetLife as a bank holding company.

•

The proposals under consideration in Congress also include
    special regulatory and insolvency regimes, including even higher
    capital, prudential and liquidity standards for financial
    institutions that are deemed to be systemically significant.
    These insolvency regimes could vary from the resolution regimes
    currently applicable to some subsidiaries of such companies and
    could include assessments on financial companies to provide for
    a systemic resolution fund.

•

The Obama Administration, members of Congress and Federal
    banking regulators have suggested new or increased taxes or
    assessments on banks and financial firms to mitigate the costs
    to taxpayers of various government programs established to
    address the financial crisis and to offset the costs of
    potential future crises. See “— Actions of the
    U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other
    Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and
    Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended
    Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive
    Position.”

•

The proposed legislation also includes new conditions on the
    writing and trading of certain standardized and non-standardized
    derivatives.

The creation of an additional supervisor with authority over
    MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the likelihood of additional
    regulations, and the other changes discussed above could require
    changes to MetLife’s operations. Whether such changes would
    affect our competitiveness in comparison to other institutions
    is uncertain, since it is possible that at least some of our
    competitors will be similarly affected. Competitive effects are
    possible, however, if MetLife, Inc. were required to pay any new
    or increased taxes, or if it were determined to be systemically
    significant and were subjected to higher capital and liquidity
    requirements and generally stricter prudential supervisory
    standards as a result. It is unclear at present whether
    systemically significant institutions will be helped or hurt
    competitively if such additional requirements are imposed. We
    cannot predict whether these or other proposals will be adopted,
    or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such
    laws, could have on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations or on our dealings with other financial
    institutions.



As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is
    subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and
    guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the
    business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as
    well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC, the
    Federal Reserve and the FDIC.

Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of
    MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to,
    among other things:

•

chartering to carry on business as a bank;

•

maintaining minimum capital ratios;

•

capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;

•

safety and soundness standards;

•

loan loss and other related liabilities;

•

liquidity;

•

financial reporting and disclosure standards;

•

counterparty credit concentration;

•

restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;

•

lending limits;

•

payment of interest;

•

unfair or deceptive acts or practices;

•

privacy; and

•

bank holding company and bank change of control.

Furthermore, Congress is considering establishing a new
    governmental agency that would supervise and regulate
    institutions that provide certain financial products and
    services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services
    to which this legislation would apply might exclude certain
    insurance business, the new agency would have authority to
    regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank. Federal
    pre-emption of state consumer protection laws applicable to
    banking services may be eliminated or significantly restricted
    in any financial services regulatory reform legislation that
    Congress may pass, which would increase the regulatory and
    compliance burden on MetLife Bank and could adversely affect its
    business and results of operations.

The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors.
    Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our
    control, the liabilities that we have currently established for
    these potential liabilities may not be adequate.

Federal and state banking regulators regularly re-examine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their
    products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on the financial condition and results
    of operations of MetLife Bank.

Our international operations are subject to regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is
    similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of
    our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate
    in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that
    affect their operations also may affect our business
    relationships with them and their ability to purchase or
    distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. See “— Our International
    Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks
    that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability.”

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
    consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
    regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect
    compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.



From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations
    or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries that could, if
    determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot
    predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that
    could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the
    interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and
    statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in
    areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.

We are also subject to other regulations, including banking
    regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional
    regulations. See “Business — Regulation.”

We Are
    Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which
    May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial
    Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary
    from Period to Period

We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets
    risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange
    rates, market volatility, the performance of the economy in
    general, the performance of the specific obligors included in
    our portfolio and other factors outside our control.

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the
    market price and cash flow variability associated with changes
    in interest rates. A rise in interest rates will increase the
    net unrealized loss position of our fixed income investment
    portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically
    within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life
    insurance businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk.
    Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders
    may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate
    environment, requiring us to liquidate fixed income investments
    in an unrealized loss position. Due to the long-term nature of
    the liabilities associated with certain of our life insurance
    businesses, guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, and
    structured settlements, sustained declines in long-term interest
    rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging
    costs. In other situations, declines in interest rates may
    result in increasing the duration of certain life insurance
    liabilities, creating asset-liability duration mismatches. Our
    investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive
    instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be
    adversely affected by changes in interest rates from
    governmental monetary policies, domestic and international
    economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our
    control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net
    unrealized loss position of our fixed income investment
    portfolio, offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return
    on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates
    would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our fixed
    income investment portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on
    funds reinvested. Our mitigation efforts with respect to
    interest rate risk are primarily focused towards maintaining an
    investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a
    weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the
    duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However,
    our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may be
    inaccurate and we may be forced to liquidate fixed income
    investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the
    liability. Although we take measures to manage the economic
    risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we
    may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our fixed
    income investments relative to our liabilities. See also
    “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price
    and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit
    spreads. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net
    unrealized loss position of the fixed-income investment
    portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit based
    non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and,
    if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an
    extended period of time, would likely result in higher

other-than-temporary

impairments (“OTTI”). Credit spread tightening will
    reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of
    fixed maturity securities. In addition, market volatility can
    make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading
    becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include
    assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to
    period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
    Credit spreads on both corporate and structured securities
    widened significantly during 2008, resulting in continuing
    depressed pricing. As a result of improved conditions, credit
    spreads narrowed in 2009. If there is a resumption of
    significant volatility in the markets, it could cause changes in
    credit spreads and defaults  and a lack of pricing transparency
    which, individually or in tandem, could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial
    condition,



liquidity or cash flows through realized investment losses,
    impairments, and changes in unrealized loss positions. See also
    “— Guarantees Within Certain of Our Variable
    Annuity Guarantee Benefits that Protect Policyholders Against
    Significant Downturns in Equity Markets May Increase the
    Volatility of Our Results Related to the Inclusion of an Own
    Credit Adjustment in the Estimated Fair Value of the Liability
    for These Guaranteed Benefits.”

Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for
    lower earnings associated with certain of our insurance
    businesses where fee income is earned based upon the estimated
    fair value of the assets under management. Equity market
    downturns and volatility may discourage purchases of separate
    account products, such as variable annuities and variable life
    insurance that have underlying mutual funds with returns linked
    to the performance of the equity markets, and may cause some of
    our existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce
    investments in those products. In addition, downturns and
    volatility in equity markets can have a material adverse effect
    on the revenues and returns from our savings and investment
    products and services. Because these products and services
    depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under
    management, a decline in the equity markets could reduce our
    revenues by reducing the value of the investments we manage. The
    retail annuity business in particular is highly sensitive to
    equity markets, and a sustained weakness in the equity markets
    could decrease revenues and earnings in variable annuity
    products. Furthermore, certain of our annuity products offer
    guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit
    exposure should equity markets decline. The Company uses
    derivatives to mitigate the impact of such increased potential
    benefit exposures. We are also exposed to interest rate and
    equity risk based upon the discount rate and expected long-term
    rate of return assumptions associated with our pension and other
    postretirement benefit obligations. Sustained declines in
    long-term interest rates or equity returns likely would have a
    negative effect on the funded status of these plans.

We also provide certain guarantees within some of our products
    that protect policyholders against significant downturns in the
    equity markets. For example, we offer variable annuity products
    with guaranteed features, such as death benefits, withdrawal
    benefits, and minimum accumulation and income benefits. In
    volatile or declining equity market conditions, we may need to
    increase liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholder
    account balances, negatively affecting our net income. The
    Company uses derivatives to mitigate the impact of volatile or
    declining equity market conditions. A decline in equity markets
    also may reduce the estimated fair value of the investments
    supporting our pension and post retirement benefit plan
    obligations, changing the funded status of such plans, and
    adversely affect our results of operations. Lastly, we invest a
    portion of our investments in equity securities, leveraged
    buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds and
    the estimated fair value of such investments may be impacted by
    downturns or volatility in equity markets.

Our primary exposure to real estate risk relates to commercial
    and agricultural real estate. Our exposure to commercial and
    agricultural real estate risk stems from various factors. These
    factors include, but are not limited to, market conditions
    including the demand and supply of space, creditworthiness of
    tenants and partners, capital markets volatility and the
    inherent interest rate movement. Recently, a significantly
    weakened economic environment has led to declining commercial
    real estate tenant demand, increasing vacancy rates and
    declining property incomes. In addition, capital market
    conditions and accessibility to financing has prompted an
    increase in the risk premiums assessed in the sector. These
    trends have resulted in decreases in the value of our equity
    commercial real estate holdings, and deterioration in the value
    of the collateral securing our commercial mortgages. In
    addition, our real estate joint venture development program is
    subject to risks including, but not limited to, reduced property
    sales and decreased availability of financing which could
    adversely impact the joint venture developments

and/or

operations. The state of the economy and speed of recovery in
    fundamental and capital market conditions in the commercial and
    agricultural real estate sectors will continue to influence the
    performance of our investments in these sectors. These factors
    and others beyond our control could have a material adverse
    effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial
    condition, liquidity or cash flows through net investment
    income, realized investment losses and impairments.

Our primary foreign currency exchange risks are described under
    “— Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could Negatively Affect Our
    Profitability.” Significant declines in equity prices,
    changes in U.S. interest rates, changes in credit spreads,
    and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity. Changes in these
    factors, which are significant risks to us, can affect our net
    investment income in any period, and such changes can be
    substantial.



A portion of our investments are made in leveraged buy-out
    funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds reported
    within other limited partnership interests, many of which make
    private equity investments. The amount and timing of net
    investment income from such investment funds tends to be uneven
    as a result of the performance of the underlying investments,
    including private equity investments. The timing of
    distributions from the funds, which depends on particular events
    relating to the underlying investments, as well as the
    funds’ schedules for making distributions and their needs
    for cash, can be difficult to predict. As a result, the amount
    of net investment income that we record from these investments
    can vary substantially from quarter to quarter. Recent equity,
    real estate and credit market volatility have further reduced
    net investment income and related yields for these types of
    investments and we may continue to experience reduced net
    investment income due to continued volatility in the equity,
    real estate and credit markets in 2010.

In 2009, the disruption in the global financial markets
    moderated, although not all markets are functioning normally and
    many remain reliant upon government investments and liquidity.
    Continuing challenges include continued weakness in the
    U.S. real estate market and increased mortgage loan
    delinquencies, investor anxiety over the U.S. economy,
    rating agency downgrades of various structured products and
    financial issuers, unresolved issues with structured investment
    vehicles and monoline financial guarantee insurers, deleveraging
    of financial institutions and hedge funds and a serious
    dislocation in the inter-bank market. If there is a resumption
    of significant volatility in the markets, it could cause changes
    in interest rates, declines in equity prices, and the
    strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the
    U.S. Dollar which, individually or in tandem, could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows through
    realized investment losses, impairments, and changes in
    unrealized loss positions.

Changes
    in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability

Some of our products, principally traditional whole life
    insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts,
    expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce
    our “spread,” or the difference between the amounts
    that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general
    account and the rate of return we are able to earn on general
    account investments intended to support obligations under the
    contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.

As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be
    forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured
    or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our
    investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the
    fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage
    loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio
    with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates,
    which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates
    can help offset decreases in investment margins on some
    products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be
    limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates
    and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset
    yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially
    become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an
    important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA, and
    significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate
    amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected
    reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining
    interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be
    relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting
    in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium
    features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency,
    or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force
    from year to year, during a period when our new investments
    carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could
    also reduce our return on investments that do not support
    particular policy obligations. Accordingly, declining interest
    rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our
    profitability.

The sufficiency of our life insurance statutory reserves in
    Taiwan is highly sensitive to interest rates and other related
    assumptions. This is due to the sustained low interest rate
    environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate
    guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health
    contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of
    long-duration investments in the Taiwanese capital markets to
    match such long-duration liabilities. The key assumptions
    include current Taiwan government bond yield rates increasing
    from current levels of 1.8% to 3.0% over the next ten years, a
    modest increase in lapse rates, mortality and morbidity levels
    remaining consistent with recent experience, and
    U.S. Dollar-denominated investments making up 35% of total
    assets backing



life insurance statutory reserves. Current statutory reserve
    adequacy analysis shows that provisions are adequate; however,
    adverse changes in key assumptions for interest rates, lapse
    experience and mortality and morbidity levels could lead to a
    need to strengthen reserves.

Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect
    our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest
    rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the
    investments in MetLife’s general account with higher
    yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates
    necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We,
    therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower
    profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of
    existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy
    loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as
    policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as
    interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows
    requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of
    those investments are adversely affected by the increase in
    market interest rates, which may result in realized investment
    losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us
    to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would
    increase our current expenses and reduce net income. An increase
    in market interest rates could also have a material adverse
    effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by
    decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income
    securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment
    portfolio. Lastly, an increase in interest rates could result in
    decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of
    variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.

Some
    of Our Investments Are Relatively Illiquid and Are in Asset
    Classes that Have Been Experiencing Significant Market Valuation
    Fluctuations

We hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as
    privately-placed fixed maturity securities; mortgage loans;
    policy loans and leveraged leases; equity real estate, including
    real estate joint ventures and funds; and other limited
    partnership interests. These asset classes represented 33.2% of
    the carrying value of our total cash and investments at
    December 31, 2009. Even some of our very high quality
    investments have been more illiquid as a result of the current
    market conditions.

If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in
    excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or
    return cash collateral in connection with our investment
    portfolio, derivatives transactions or securities lending
    program, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a
    timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise
    would have been able to realize, or both.

The reported value of our relatively illiquid types of
    investments, our investments in the asset classes described
    above and, at times, our high quality, generally liquid asset
    classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market
    price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our
    investments in the current market, there can be no assurance
    that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we
    have recorded them and we could be forced to sell them at
    significantly lower prices.

Our
    Participation in a Securities Lending Program Subjects Us to
    Potential Liquidity and Other Risks

We participate in a securities lending program whereby blocks of
    securities, which are included in fixed maturity securities and
    short-term investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily
    brokerage firms and commercial banks. We generally obtain
    collateral in an amount equal to 102% of the estimated fair
    value of the loaned securities, which is obtained at the
    inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or
    equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. In limited
    instances, during the extraordinary market events beginning in
    the fourth quarter of 2008 and through part of 2009, we accepted
    collateral less than 102% at the inception of certain loans, but
    never less than 100%, of the estimated fair value of such loaned
    securities. At December 31, 2009, we had no loans
    outstanding where we had accepted at the inception of the loan
    collateral less than 102%, of the estimated fair value of such
    loaned securities. These loans involved U.S. Government
    Treasury Bills which we considered to have limited variation in
    their estimated fair value during the term of the loan. See
    “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments — Securities Lending.”

Returns of loaned securities by the third parties would require
    us to return the cash collateral associated with such loaned
    securities. In addition, in some cases, the maturity of the
    securities held as invested collateral (i.e., securities that we
    have purchased with cash received from the third parties) may
    exceed the term of the related



securities on loan and the estimated fair value may fall below
    the amount of cash received as collateral and invested. If we
    are required to return significant amounts of cash collateral on
    short notice and we are forced to sell securities to meet the
    return obligation, we may have difficulty selling such
    collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner, be
    forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for
    less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under
    normal market conditions, or both. In addition, under stressful
    capital market and economic conditions, such as those conditions
    we experienced during 2008 and 2009, liquidity broadly
    deteriorates, which may further restrict our ability to sell
    securities.

If we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities
    over time, the amount of investment income generated by these
    activities will also likely decline.

Our
    Requirements to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments Related to
    Declines in Estimated Fair Value of Specified Assets May
    Adversely Affect Our Liquidity and Expose Us to Counterparty
    Credit Risk

Some of our transactions with financial and other institutions
    specify the circumstances under which the parties are required
    to pledge collateral related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the specified assets. In addition, under the terms
    of some of our transactions, we may be required to make payments
    to our counterparties related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the specified assets. The amount of collateral we
    may be required to pledge and the payments we may be required to
    make under these agreements may increase under certain
    circumstances, which could adversely affect our liquidity. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Collateral Financing
    Arrangements” and Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gross
    Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities May be
    Realized or Result in Future Impairments, Resulting in a
    Reduction in Our Net Income

Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as

available-for-sale,

except trading securities, are reported at their estimated fair
    value. Unrealized gains or losses on

available-for-sale

securities are recognized as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded from net income. Our
    gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities
    at December 31, 2009 were $10.8 billion. The portion
    of the $10.8 billion of gross unrealized losses for fixed
    maturity and equity securities where the estimated fair value
    has declined and remained below amortized cost or cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater was $5.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009. The accumulated change in estimated fair
    value of these

available-for-sale

securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is
    realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the
    decline in estimated fair value is determined to be

other-than-temporary

and an impairment charge to earnings is taken. Realized losses
    or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net
    income in a particular quarterly or annual period.

The
    Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken
    on Our Investments is Highly Subjective and Could Materially
    Impact Our Results of Operations or Financial
    Position

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments
    varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. We update our evaluations regularly and
    reflect changes in allowances and impairments in net investment
    losses as such evaluations are revised. There can be no
    assurance that we have accurately assessed the level of
    impairments taken and allowances provided as reflected in our
    consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, additional
    impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in
    the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future
    impairments or allowances.

For example, the cost of our fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for impairments deemed to be

other-than-temporary

that are charged to earnings in the period in which the
    determination is made. The assessment of whether impairments
    have occurred is based on our

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The review of our fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair



value has declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by
    less than 20%; (ii) securities where the estimated fair
    value has declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by
    20% or more for less than six months; and (iii) securities
    where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below
    cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.

Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the
    security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates
    about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings
    potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process
    include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and
    the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost
    or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of
    securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial
    difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an
    entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources; (vi) with respect to fixed
    maturity securities, whether we have the intent to sell or will
    more likely than not be required to sell a particular security
    before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below
    cost or amortized cost; (vii) with respect to equity
    securities, whether we have the ability and intent to hold a
    particular security for a period of time sufficient to allow for
    the recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount at least
    equal to its cost; (viii) unfavorable changes in forecasted
    cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and
    (ix) other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

Defaults
    on Our Mortgage Loans and Volatility in Performance May
    Adversely Affect Our Profitability

Our mortgage loans face default risk and are principally
    collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential
    properties, as well as automobiles. The carrying value of
    mortgage loans is stated at original cost net of repayments,
    amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and valuation
    allowances, except for residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

accounted for under the fair value option which are carried at
    estimated fair value, as determined on a recurring basis, and
    certain commercial and residential mortgage loans carried at the
    lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on a
    nonrecurring basis. We establish valuation allowances for
    estimated impairments at the balance sheet date. Such valuation
    allowances are based on the excess carrying value of the loan
    over the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
    at the loan’s original effective interest rate, the
    estimated fair value of the loan’s collateral if the loan
    is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral
    dependent, or the loan’s observable market price if the
    loan is

held-for-sale.

We also establish valuation allowances for loan losses when a
    loss contingency exists for pools of loans with similar
    characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on similar
    property types or loans having similar

loan-to-value

or similar debt service coverage factors. At December 31,
    2009, loans that were either delinquent or in the process of
    foreclosure totaled less than 0.5% of our mortgage loan
    investments. The performance of our mortgage loan investments,
    however, may fluctuate in the future. In addition, substantially
    all of our mortgage loans

held-for-investment

have balloon payment maturities. An increase in the default rate
    of our mortgage loan investments could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition through realized investment losses or increases in our
    valuation allowances. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Investments — Mortgage
    Loans.”

Further, any geographic or sector concentration of our mortgage
    loans may have adverse effects on our investment portfolios and
    consequently on our consolidated results of operations or
    financial condition. While we seek to mitigate this risk by
    having a broadly diversified portfolio, events or developments
    that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region
    or sector may have a greater adverse effect on the investment
    portfolios to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated.
    Moreover, our ability to sell assets relating to such particular
    groups of related assets may be limited if other market
    participants are seeking to sell at the same time. In addition,
    legislative proposals that would allow or require modifications
    to the terms of mortgage loans could be enacted. We cannot
    predict whether these proposals will be adopted, or what impact,
    if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on
    our business or investments.



The
    Impairment of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us

We have exposure to many different industries and
    counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry, including
    brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge
    funds and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of
    these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of
    default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to
    secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when
    the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
    prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
    derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these
    financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt
    instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities,
    derivative transactions and equity investments. Further,
    potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in
    response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking
    system and financial markets, such as investment,
    nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other
    intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new
    authority that may be created, could negatively impact these
    instruments, securities, transactions and investments. There can
    be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the
    carrying value of these investments would not materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We
    Face Unforeseen Liabilities or Asset Impairments or Rating
    Actions Arising from Possible Acquisitions and Dispositions of
    Businesses or Difficulties Integrating Such
    Businesses

We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses
    in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments,
    including goodwill impairments, that arise in connection with
    the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may
    acquire in the future. In addition, there may be liabilities or
    asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in
    the course of performing due diligence investigations on each
    business that we have acquired or may acquire. Furthermore, the
    use of our own funds as consideration in any acquisition would
    consume capital resources that would no longer be available for
    other corporate purposes. Moreover, as a result of uncertainty
    and risks associated with potential acquisitions and
    dispositions of businesses, rating agencies may take certain
    actions with respect to the ratings assigned to MetLife, Inc.

and/or

its
    subsidiaries. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Rating Actions.”

Our ability to achieve certain benefits we anticipate from any
    acquisitions of businesses will depend in large part upon our
    ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an
    efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to integrate
    such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may
    take longer than expected. The integration of operations may
    require the dedication of significant management resources,
    which may distract management’s attention from

day-to-day

business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the
    operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to
    realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such
    acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be
    less than expected.

Fluctuations
    in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities
    Markets Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability

We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar resulting
    from our holdings of

non-U.S. Dollar

denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and
    net income from foreign operations and issuance of

non-U.S. Dollar

denominated instruments, including guaranteed interest contracts
    and funding agreements. These risks relate to potential
    decreases in estimated fair value and income resulting from a
    strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the
    U.S. Dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign
    currencies versus the U.S. Dollar will adversely affect the
    estimated fair value of our

non-U.S. Dollar

denominated investments and our investments in foreign
    subsidiaries. Although we use foreign currency swaps and forward
    contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk, we
    cannot provide assurance that these methods will be effective or
    that our counterparties will perform their obligations. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

From time to time, various emerging market countries have
    experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
    significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to
    foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in
    certain emerging markets.



We have matched substantially all of our foreign currency
    liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with investments
    denominated in their respective foreign currency, which limits
    the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local
    operating results; however, fluctuations in such rates affect
    the translation of these results into our U.S. Dollar basis
    consolidated financial statements. Although we take certain
    actions to address this risk, foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuation could materially adversely affect our reported
    results due to unhedged positions or the failure of hedges to
    effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange
    rate fluctuation. See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability

Our international operations face political, legal, operational
    and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations.
    We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization
    or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls
    or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds
    from these operations out of the countries in which they operate
    or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. Dollars or
    other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are,
    and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where
    these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we
    rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter
    labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and
    trade unions in some countries. In Japan, China and India we
    operate with local business partners with the resulting risk of
    managing partner relationships to the business objectives. If
    our business model is not successful in a particular country, we
    may lose all or most of our investment in building and training
    the sales force in that country.

We are currently planning to expand our international operations
    in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets.
    This may require considerable management time, as well as

start-up

expenses for market development before any significant revenues
    and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets
    may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in
    existing markets may be affected by local economic and market
    conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not
    achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations
    may be negatively impacted.

In recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been
    very challenging. In Argentina, we were formerly principally
    engaged in the pension business. In December 2008, the Argentine
    government nationalized private pensions and seized the pension
    funds’ investments, eliminating the private pensions
    business in Argentina. As a result, we have experienced and will
    continue to experience reductions in the operation’s
    revenues and cash flows. The Argentine government now controls
    all assets which previously were managed by our Argentine
    pension operations. Further governmental or legal actions
    related to our operations in Argentina could negatively impact
    our operations in Argentina and result in future losses.

    Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding the
    impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.

As a
    Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its
    Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds to It to Meet Its Obligations and
    Pay Dividends

MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and
    financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant
    operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and
    permitted payments to it under its tax sharing arrangements with
    its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its
    obligations and to pay preferred and common dividends. If the
    cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries is
    insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding
    company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may be required to raise cash
    through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional
    equity or the sale of assets.

The payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife,
    Inc. by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance
    laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of
    prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In
    addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of
    dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to
    MetLife, Inc. if they determine that the payment could be
    adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation” and Note 18 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and



Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Dividends from
    Subsidiaries.”

Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or
    advances by our foreign subsidiaries to MetLife, Inc. could be
    subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends or
    repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary transfer
    restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the
    jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate. See
    “— Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks That Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability.”

A
    Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or
    Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Financial strength ratings, which various Nationally Recognized
    Statistical Rating Organizations (each, an “NRSRO”)
    publish as indicators of an insurance company’s ability to
    meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important
    to maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to
    market our products and our competitive position. See
    “Business — Company Ratings — Insurer
    Financial Strength Ratings.”

Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including:

•

reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other
    investment products;

•

adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and
    independent sales intermediaries;

•

materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders
    and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;

•

requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and
    services to remain competitive; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at
    reasonable prices or at all.

In addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance
    subsidiaries, various NRSROs also publish credit ratings for
    MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries. Credit ratings
    are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms
    of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors
    in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain
    types of liquidity. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Credit Ratings.” Downgrades in our
    credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations in many ways,
    including adversely limiting our access to capital markets,
    potentially increasing the cost of debt, and requiring us to
    post collateral. For example, with respect to derivative
    transactions with credit ratings downgrade triggers, a two-notch
    downgrade would have impacted our derivative collateral
    requirements by $146 million at December 31, 2009.
    Also, $480 million of liabilities associated with funding
    agreements and other capital market products were subject to
    credit ratings downgrade triggers that permit early termination
    subject to a notice period of 90 days.

In view of the difficulties experienced during 2008 and 2009 by
    many financial institutions, including our competitors in the
    insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs
    will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply
    to such institutions, will continue to increase the frequency
    and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request
    additional information from the companies that they rate, and
    may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in
    the NRSRO models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.
    Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable,” “negative”
    or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term
    trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a
    ratings change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook
    to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however,
    a “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency
    from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain
    rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as
    “CreditWatch” or “Under Review” to indicate
    their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating.
    These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection
    with certain events such as potential mergers and acquisitions,
    or material changes in a company’s results, in order for
    the rating agencies to perform its analysis to fully determine
    the rating implications of the event. Certain rating agencies
    have recently implemented rating actions, including downgrades,
    outlook changes and modifiers, for MetLife, Inc.’s and
    certain of its subsidiaries’ insurer financial strength and
    credit ratings. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Rating Actions.”



We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what
    actions we may take in response to the actions of rating
    agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with
    other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings
    could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any
    NRSRO.

An
    Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a
    Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit
    and Financial Strength Ratings

We have a $2.85 billion five-year revolving credit facility
    that matures in June 2012, as well as other facilities which we
    enter into in the ordinary course of business. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Holding Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Credit and Committed
    Facilities” and Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of
    liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be
    critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our
    ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market
    when alternative sources of credit are tight. The credit
    facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants. We must comply with covenants under our
    credit facilities (including the $2.85 billion five-year
    revolving credit facility), including a requirement to maintain
    a specified minimum consolidated net worth.

Our right to make borrowings under these facilities is subject
    to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including
    our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow
    under these facilities is also subject to the continued
    willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the
    facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the
    covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to
    borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending
    commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other
    reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the
    facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit
    facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Defaults,
    Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Carrying Value of Our
    Fixed Maturity or Equity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our
    Earnings

We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of
    fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and
    interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk
    that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities,
    including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal
    and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows
    paid to our investment. Fixed maturity securities represent a
    significant portion of our investment portfolio. The occurrence
    of a major economic downturn (such as the downturn in the
    economy during late 2008 and 2009), acts of corporate
    malfeasance, widening risk spreads, or other events that
    adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying
    collateral of these securities could cause the estimated fair
    value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our
    earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity
    securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings
    downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular
    securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit
    quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities
    in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect.
    With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or
    guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings
    downgrade affecting

asset-backed

securities (“ABS”) we hold could indicate the credit
    quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the
    capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our
    risk-based capital levels. Any event reducing the estimated fair
    value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could
    have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
    operations and financial condition. Levels of writedowns or
    impairments are impacted by our assessment of intent to sell, or
    whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to
    sell, fixed maturity securities and the intent and ability to
    hold equity securities which have declined in value until
    recovery. If we determine to reposition or realign portions of
    the portfolio so as not to hold certain equity securities, or
    intend to sell or determine that it is more likely than not that
    we will be required to sell, certain fixed maturity securities
    in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery, then we will
    incur an

other-than-temporary

impairment charge in the period that the decision was made not
    to hold the equity security to recovery, or to sell, or the
    determination was made it is more likely than not that we will
    be required to sell the fixed maturity security.



Our
    Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to
    Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Business

Management of risk requires, among other things, policies and
    procedures to record properly and verify a large number of
    transactions and events. We have devoted significant resources
    to develop our risk management policies and procedures and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
    policies and procedures may not be comprehensive. Many of our
    methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use
    of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on
    historical models. As a result, these methods may not fully
    predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater
    than our historical measures indicate. Other risk management
    methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding
    markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that
    is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This
    information may not always be accurate, complete,

up-to-date

or properly evaluated. See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Reinsurance
    May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us
    Against Losses

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    business segments. See “Business — Reinsurance
    Activity.” While reinsurance agreements generally bind the
    reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally
    fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine
    the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new
    business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for
    business already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any
    increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we
    may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or
    may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable
    terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future
    business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect
    to those policies we issue.

If the
    Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification
    Arrangements or to the Derivative Instruments We Use to Hedge
    Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed
    to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivative instruments
    to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general,
    reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
    policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us.
    Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers
    and indemnitors. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers
    will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that
    indemnitors will honor their obligations now or in the future or
    that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A
    reinsurer’s or indemnitor’s insolvency, inability or
    unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance
    agreements or indemnity agreements with us could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various
    business risks. We enter into a variety of derivative
    instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit
    default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments.” If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor
    their obligations under these derivative instruments, our hedges
    of the related risk will be ineffective. This is a more
    pronounced risk to us in view of the stresses suffered by
    financial institutions over the past two years. Such failure
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Differences
    Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving
    Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Results

Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our
    actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we
    use in setting prices for our products and establishing
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Our
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are
    established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will
    need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance
    and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on
    many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to
    be received over the assumed



life of the policy, the timing of the event covered by the
    insurance policy, the amount of benefits or claims to be paid
    and the investment returns on the investments we make with the
    premiums we receive. We establish liabilities for property and
    casualty claims and benefits based on assumptions and estimates
    of damages and liabilities incurred. To the extent that actual
    claims experience is less favorable than the underlying
    assumptions we used in establishing such liabilities, we could
    be required to increase our liabilities.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for
    future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely
    the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our
    liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when those payments may not occur until well into
    the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on
    changes in the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as
    well as our actual experience. We charge or credit changes in
    our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are
    established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally
    established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we
    must increase them. Such increases could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Catastrophes
    May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and
    Reinsurance Availability

Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of
    catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that
    causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics
    have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the
    likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be
    predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on
    the global economy or the economies of particular countries or
    regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system,
    food supply, consumption, overall economic output and,
    eventually, on the financial markets. In addition, a pandemic
    that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors
    or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt
    our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties,
    including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in
    combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have
    a material impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group
    insurance operations, a localized event that affects the
    workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could
    cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims.
    These events could cause a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations in any period and, depending on their
    severity, could also materially and adversely affect our
    financial condition.

Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will
    likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may
    have a material adverse impact on the business, results of
    operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home
    segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to
    manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility
    management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not
    eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms,
    earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather
    (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards),
    fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks.
    Historically, substantially all of our catastrophe-related
    claims have related to homeowners coverages. However,
    catastrophes may also affect other Auto & Home
    coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence,
    timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition, changing
    climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be
    increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and
    severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes.

Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our
    homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include
    coastal sections of the northeastern United States (including
    lower New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts),
    the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and
    Texas) and Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure,
    primarily along the New Madrid fault line in the central United
    States and in the Pacific Northwest.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
    the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, pandemics,
    hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce
    significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are
    heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made
    catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our
    financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could
    materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial
    condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial



condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability
    of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new
    business could also be affected. It is possible that increases
    in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other
    factors, and geographic concentration of insured property, could
    increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the
    future.

Most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries
    are admitted to transact business require life and property and
    casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to
    participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay
    contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued
    by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations
    levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member
    insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate
    share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of
    business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is
    engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or
    controlled organizations providing life and property and
    casualty insurance to their citizens. The activities of such
    organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy
    of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also
    have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the
    guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member
    insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial
    premium tax offsets. See “Business —
    Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty
    Associations and Similar Arrangements.”

While in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied
    against MetLife have not been material, it is possible that a
    large catastrophic event could render such guaranty funds
    inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional
    amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations in a particular period. We
    have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that
    we consider adequate for assessments with respect to insurers
    that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings, but
    additional liabilities may be necessary. See Note 16 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we
    establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only
    after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We
    cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will
    be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to
    time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of
    limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as
    legislation restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw
    from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our
    exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed
    by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or
    multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our
    property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in
    part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may
    not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future.
    See “— Reinsurance May Not Be Available,
    Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.”

Our
    Statutory Reserve Financings May be Subject to Cost Increases
    and New Financings May be Subject to Limited Market
    Capacity

To support statutory reserves for several products including,
    but not limited to, our level premium term life and universal
    life with secondary guarantees and MLIC’s closed block, we
    currently utilize capital markets solutions for financing a
    portion of our statutory reserve requirements. While we have
    financing facilities in place for our previously written
    business and have remaining capacity in existing facilities to
    support writings through the end of 2010 or later, certain of
    these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the
    occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of MetLife or are
    subject to periodic repricing. Any resulting cost increases
    could negatively impact our financial results.

Future capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures
    in the marketplace is not guaranteed. If capacity becomes
    unavailable for a prolonged period of time, hindering our
    ability to obtain funding for these new structures, our ability
    to write additional business in a cost effective manner may be
    impacted.



Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability

Our business segments are subject to intense competition. We
    believe that this competition is based on a number of factors,
    including service, product features, scale, price, financial
    strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurers, as well as non-insurance financial
    services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset
    managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group
    customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and
    investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader
    array of products, have more competitive pricing or more
    attractive features in their products or, with respect to other
    insurers, have higher claims paying ability ratings. Some may
    also have greater financial resources with which to compete.
    National banks, which may sell annuity products of life insurers
    in some circumstances, also have pre-existing customer bases for
    financial services products.

Many of our group insurance products are underwritten annually,
    and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be
    able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

In addition, the investment management and securities brokerage
    businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually
    attract new entrants. See “Business —
    Competition.”

Finally, the choices made by the U.S. Treasury in the
    administration of EESA and in its distribution of amounts
    available thereunder could have the effect of supporting some
    parts of the financial system more than others. See
    “— Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory
    Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the
    Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not
    Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect
    MetLife’s Competitive Position.”

Industry
    Trends Could Adversely Affect the Profitability of Our
    Businesses

Our business segments continue to be influenced by a variety of
    trends that affect the insurance industry, including competition
    with respect to product features, price, distribution
    capability, customer service and information technology. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Industry
    Trends.” The impact on our business and on the life
    insurance industry generally of the volatility and instability
    of the financial markets is difficult to predict, and our
    business plans, financial condition and results of operations
    may be negatively impacted or affected in other unexpected ways.
    In addition, the life insurance industry is subject to state
    regulation, and, as complex products are introduced, regulators
    may refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving
    standards. Furthermore, regulators have undertaken market and
    sales practices reviews of several markets or products,
    including variable annuities and group products. The market
    environment may also lead to changes in regulation that may
    benefit or disadvantage us relative to some of our competitors.
    See “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect
    Our Market Share and Profitability” and
    “Business — Competition.”

Consolidation
    of Distributors of Insurance Products May Adversely Affect the
    Insurance Industry and the Profitability of Our
    Business

The insurance industry distributes many of its individual
    products through other financial institutions such as banks and
    broker-dealers. An increase in bank and broker-dealer
    consolidation activity may negatively impact the industry’s
    sales, and such consolidation could increase competition for
    access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses
    and impair our ability to market insurance products to our
    current customer base or to expand our customer base.
    Consolidation of distributors

and/or

other
    industry changes may also increase the likelihood that
    distributors will try to renegotiate the terms of any existing
    selling agreements to terms less favorable to us.



Our
    Investments are Reflected Within the Consolidated Financial
    Statements Utilizing Different Accounting Bases and Accordingly
    We May Have Recognized Differences, Which May Be Significant,
    Between Cost and Estimated Fair Value in our Consolidated
    Financial Statements

Our principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity
    securities, trading securities, short-term investments, mortgage
    loans, policy loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests and other invested assets.
    The carrying value of such investments is as follows:

•

Fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as

available-for-sale,

except for trading securities, and are reported at their
    estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on
    these securities are recorded as a separate component of other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of policyholder related amounts
    and deferred income taxes.

•

Trading securities are recorded at estimated fair value with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income.

•

Short-term investments include investments with remaining
    maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months,
    at the time of acquisition. Short-term investments that meet the
    definition of a security are stated at estimated fair value, and
    short-term investments that do not meet the definition of a
    security are stated at amortized cost, which approximates
    estimated fair value.

•

The carrying value of mortgage loans is stated at original cost
    net of repayments, amortization of premiums, accretion of
    discounts and valuation allowances, except for residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

accounted for under the fair value option which are carried at
    estimated fair value, as determined on a recurring basis, and
    certain commercial and residential mortgage loans carried at the
    lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on a
    nonrecurring basis.

•

Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.

•

Real estate

held-for-investment,

including related improvements, is stated at cost, less
    accumulated depreciation.

•

Real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which we have more than a minor equity interest or
    more than a minor influence over the joint ventures or
    partnership’s operations, but where we do not have a
    controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, are
    carried using the equity method of accounting. We use the cost
    method of accounting for investments in real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnership interests in which we
    have a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over
    the joint ventures or the partnership’s operations.

•

Other invested assets consist principally of freestanding
    derivatives with positive estimated fair values and leveraged
    leases. Freestanding derivatives are carried at estimated fair
    value with changes in estimated fair value reflected in income
    for both non-qualifying derivatives and derivatives in fair
    value hedging relationships. Changes in estimated fair value of
    derivatives in cash flow or in net investments in foreign
    operations hedging relationships are reflected as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss). Leveraged leases
    are recorded net of non-recourse debt.

Investments not carried at estimated fair value in our
    consolidated financial statements — principally,
    mortgage loans

held-for-investment,

policy loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures, other
    limited partnerships and leveraged leases — may have
    estimated fair values which are substantially higher or lower
    than the carrying value reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements. Each of these asset classes is regularly evaluated
    for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the
    respective asset class.



Our
    Valuation of Fixed Maturity, Equity and Trading Securities and
    Short-Term Investments May Include Methodologies, Estimations
    and Assumptions Which Are Subject to Differing Interpretations
    and Could Result in Changes to Investment Valuations that May
    Materially Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or
    Financial Condition

Fixed maturity, equity, and trading securities and short-term
    investments which are reported at estimated fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheets represent the majority of our total
    cash and investments. We have categorized these securities into
    a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to
    the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy
    gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets
    for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the
    lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset
    or liability’s classification within the fair value
    hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to
    its valuation. The input levels are as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. We define active markets based on average
    trading volume for equity securities. The size of the bid/ask
    spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed
    maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or
    liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation.

At December 31, 2009, 8.0%, 84.3% and 7.7% of these
    securities represented Level 1, Level 2 and
    Level 3, respectively. The Level 1 securities
    primarily consist of certain U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities; certain foreign
    government fixed maturity securities; exchange-traded common
    stock; certain trading securities; and certain short-term
    investments. The Level 2 assets include fixed maturity and
    equity securities priced principally through independent pricing
    services using observable inputs. These fixed maturity
    securities include most U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed securities, as well as the majority of
    U.S. and foreign corporate securities, RMBS, commercial
    mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), state and
    political subdivision securities, foreign government securities,
    and ABS. Equity securities classified as Level 2 primarily
    consist of non-redeemable preferred securities and certain
    equity securities where market quotes are available but are not
    considered actively traded and are priced by independent pricing
    services. We review the valuation methodologies used by the
    independent pricing services on an ongoing basis and ensure that
    any changes to valuation methodologies are justified.
    Level 3 assets include fixed maturity securities priced
    principally through independent non-binding broker quotations or
    market standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are
    not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 consists of
    less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading
    activity or where less price transparency exists around the
    inputs to the valuation methodologies including: U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities — including below
    investment grade private placements; RMBS; CMBS; and
    ABS — including all of those supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans. Equity securities classified as Level 3
    securities consist principally of non-redeemable preferred stock
    and common stock of companies that are privately held or
    companies for which there has been very limited trading activity
    or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation. See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for the estimated fair values of these
    assets by hierarchy level.

Prices provided by independent pricing services and independent
    non-binding broker quotations can vary widely even for the same
    security.



The determination of estimated fair values by management in the
    absence of quoted market prices is based on: (i) valuation
    methodologies; (ii) securities we deem to be comparable;
    and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of
    the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

During periods of market disruption including periods of
    significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening
    credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value
    certain of our securities, for example

sub-prime

mortgage-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities where the
    underlying loans are Alt-A and CMBS, if trading becomes less
    frequent

and/or

market data becomes less observable. In times of financial
    market disruption, certain asset classes that were in active
    markets with significant observable data may become illiquid. In
    such cases, more securities may fall to Level 3 and thus
    require more subjectivity and management judgment. As such,
    valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less
    observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation
    methods which are more sophisticated or require greater
    estimation thereby resulting in estimated fair values which may
    be greater or less than the amount at which the investments may
    be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented
    credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the
    valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated
    financial statements and the

period-to-period

changes in estimated fair value could vary significantly.
    Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial condition.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well, We May Be Required to Recognize
    an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to
    Establish a Valuation Allowance Against the Deferred Income Tax
    Asset, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or
    Financial Condition

Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire
    subsidiaries and other businesses over the estimated fair value
    of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill
    at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is
    performed based upon estimates of the estimated fair value of
    the “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates.
    The reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one
    level below that operating segment if discrete financial
    information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at
    that level. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is
    impacted by the performance of the business. The performance of
    our businesses may be adversely impacted by prolonged market
    declines. If it is determined that the goodwill has been
    impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the
    impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such
    writedowns could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position. See
    “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates —
    Goodwill.”

Long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also
    require impairment testing to determine whether changes in
    circumstances indicate that MetLife will be unable to recover
    the carrying amount of the asset group through future operations
    of that asset group or market conditions that will impact the
    estimated fair value of those assets. Such writedowns could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences
    between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to
    determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s
    determination include the performance of the business including
    the ability to generate future taxable income. If based on
    available information, it is more likely than not that the
    deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation
    allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net
    income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Further or continued deterioration of financial market
    conditions could result in a decrease in the expected future
    earnings of our reporting units, which could lead to an
    impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with them
    in future periods. Such deterioration could also result in the
    impairment of long-lived assets and the establishment of a
    valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets.



If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus
    Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC and VOBA Vary
    Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization
    and/or Impair the DAC and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our
    Results of Operations or Financial Condition

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and
    renewal business. Those costs that vary with and are primarily
    related to the production of new and renewal business are
    deferred and referred to as DAC. The recovery of DAC is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    The amount of future profit or margin is dependent principally
    on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest
    crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to
    administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance
    counterparties and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment
    returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of
    such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into
    management’s estimates of gross profits or margins, which
    generally are used to amortize such costs. If the estimates of
    gross profits or margins were overstated, then the amortization
    of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual
    experience is known and would result in a charge to income.
    Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in
    an acceleration of amortization of the DAC related to variable
    annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a
    charge to income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

VOBA reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in
    a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion
    of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the
    right to receive future cash flows from the insurance and
    annuity contracts in-force at the acquisition date. VOBA is
    based on actuarially determined projections. Actual experience
    may vary from the projections. Revisions to estimates result in
    changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which
    the revisions are made and could result in an impairment and a
    charge to income. Also, as VOBA is amortized similarly to DAC,
    an acceleration of the amortization of VOBA would occur if the
    estimates of gross profits or margins were overstated.
    Accordingly, the amortization of such costs would be accelerated
    in the period in which the actual experience is known and would
    result in a charge to net income. Significant or sustained
    equity market declines could result in an acceleration of
    amortization of the VOBA related to variable annuity and
    variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to
    income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on
    our results of operations or financial condition.

See “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired”
    for further consideration of DAC and VOBA .

Changes
    in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board or Other Standard-Setting Bodies May Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP,
    which is periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to
    adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized
    authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting
    standard setters to expose new guidance which further interprets
    or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to
    financial instruments, structures or transactions, as well as to
    issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of
    accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet
    implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on

Form 10-K

and

Form 10-Q.

An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such
    proposals are subject to change through the exposure process
    and, therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot
    be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting
    standards we are required to adopt could change the current
    accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial
    statements and that such changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.



Changes
    in Our Discount Rate, Expected Rate of Return and Expected
    Compensation Increase Assumptions for Our Pension and Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plans May Result in Increased Expenses
    and Reduce Our Profitability

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan
    costs based on our best estimates of future plan experience.
    These assumptions are reviewed regularly and include discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected
    increases in compensation levels and expected medical inflation.
    Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses
    and reduce our profitability. See Note 17 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on how changes
    in these assumptions would affect plan costs.

Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Variable Annuity Guarantee Benefits that
    Protect Policyholders Against Significant Downturns in Equity
    Markets May Increase the Volatility of Our Results Related to
    the Inclusion of an Own Credit Adjustment in the Estimated Fair
    Value of the Liability for These Guaranteed
    Benefits

In determining the valuation of certain variable annuity
    guarantee benefit liabilities that are carried at estimated fair
    value, we must consider our own credit standing, which is not
    hedged. A decrease in our own credit spread could cause the
    value of these liabilities to increase, resulting in a reduction
    to net income. An increase in our own credit spread could cause
    the value of these liabilities to decrease, resulting in an
    increase to net income. Because this credit adjustment is
    determined, at least in part, by taking into consideration
    publicly available information relating to our publicly-traded
    debt, the overall condition of fixed income markets may impact
    this adjustment. The credit premium implied in our
    publicly-traded debt, instruments may not always necessarily
    reflect our actual credit rating or our claims paying ability.
    Recently, the fixed income markets have experienced a period of
    extreme volatility which has impacted market liquidity and
    credit spreads. An increase in credit default swap spreads has
    at times been even more pronounced than in the fixed income cash
    markets. In a broad based market downturn, an increase in our
    own credit spread could result in net income being relatively
    flat when a deterioration in other market inputs required for
    the estimate of fair value would otherwise result in a
    significant reduction in net income. The inclusion of our own
    credit standing in this case has the effect of muting the actual
    net income losses recognized. In subsequent periods, if our
    credit spreads improve relative to the overall market, we could
    have a reduction of net income in an overall improving market.

Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Products that Protect Policyholders
    Against Significant Downturns in Equity Markets May Decrease Our
    Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results if Hedging or
    Risk Management Strategies Prove Ineffective, Result in Higher
    Hedging Costs and Expose Us to Increased Counterparty
    Risk

Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed
    benefits. These include guaranteed death benefits, guaranteed
    withdrawal benefits, lifetime withdrawal guarantees, guaranteed
    minimum accumulation benefits, and guaranteed minimum income
    benefits. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in
    equity markets, increased equity volatility, or reduced interest
    rates could result in an increase in the valuation of the future
    policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities
    associated with such products, resulting in a reduction to net
    income. We use reinsurance in combination with derivative
    instruments to mitigate the liability exposure and the
    volatility of net income associated with these liabilities, and
    while we believe that these and other actions have mitigated the
    risks related to these benefits, we remain liable for the
    guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative
    counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In addition, we
    are subject to the risk that hedging and other management
    procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder
    behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events,
    produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management
    techniques employed. These, individually or collectively, may
    have a material adverse effect on net income, financial
    condition or liquidity. We are also subject to the risk that the
    cost of hedging these guaranteed minimum benefits increases,
    resulting in a reduction to net income.



We May
    Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets
    Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed
    Block Policies

MLIC’s plan of reorganization, as amended (the
    “Plan”), required that we establish and operate an
    accounting mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that
    the reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own
    certain individual insurance policies of MLIC are met. See
    Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We allocated assets to the closed block in an amount
    that will produce cash flows which, together with anticipated
    revenue from the policies included in the closed block, are
    reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and
    liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not
    limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain
    expenses and tax, and to provide for the continuation of the
    policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the
    experience underlying such scales continues, and for appropriate
    adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We cannot
    provide assurance that the closed block assets, the cash flows
    generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenue
    from the policies included in the closed block will be
    sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these
    policies. If they are not sufficient, we must fund the
    shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for
    competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments
    with our general account funds.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of those
    policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are
    greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block
    was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies
    included in the closed block may be greater than they would be
    in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be
    available for distribution over time only to closed block
    policyholders.

Litigation
    and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our
    Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and
    Harm to Our Reputation

We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating
    our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our
    pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings
    specific to us and others generally applicable to business
    practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection
    with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may
    bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits
    alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or
    underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product
    design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits
    and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers.
    Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may
    seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and
    treble damages, and the damages claimed and the amount of any
    probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for
    substantial periods of time. See Note 16 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may be inherently impossible to ascertain with
    any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties can include how
    fact finders will view individually and in their totality
    documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness of
    witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information
    with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in
    our consolidated financial statements. The review includes
    senior legal and financial personnel. Unless stated elsewhere
    herein, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are established when
    it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of matters noted in Note 16 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible
    that some of the matters could require us to pay damages or make
    other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could
    not be estimated at December 31, 2009.



MLIC and its affiliates are currently defendants in numerous
    lawsuits including class actions and individual suits, alleging
    improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance
    policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.

In addition, MLIC is a defendant in a large number of lawsuits
    seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries
    allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. These lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and have alleged that MLIC learned or should have
    learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among
    other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those
    health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters
    may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate
    its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable
    uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be
    dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data
    is limited and it is difficult to predict with any certainty the
    numerous variables that can affect liability estimates,
    including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve
    claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and
    future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a
    particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the
    jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of
    tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow
    plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure took
    place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known,
    and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their
    amounts. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year. Accordingly, it is
    reasonably possible that our total exposure to asbestos claims
    may be materially greater than the liability recorded by us in
    our consolidated financial statements and that future charges to
    income may be necessary. The potential future charges could be
    material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which
    they are recorded.

We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as
    information requests, subpoenas and books and record
    examinations, from state and federal regulators and other
    authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant
    regulatory action against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the
    litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer
    significant reputational harm, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, including our ability to attract new customers,
    retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees.
    Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the
    price of stocks of companies in our industry.

We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation,
    unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and
    other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated
    claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion,
    investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future,
    and we could become subject to further investigations and have
    lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In
    addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting
    investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions
    and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Proposals
    to Regulate Compensation, if Implemented, Could Hinder or
    Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining Management and Other
    Employees with the Talent and Experience to Manage and Conduct
    Our Business Effectively

Congress is considering the possibility of regulating the
    compensation that financial institutions may provide to their
    executive officers and other employees. In addition, the Federal
    Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed guidelines on incentive
    compensation that, if adopted, may apply to or impact MetLife as
    a bank holding company. These restrictions could hinder or
    prevent us from attracting and retaining management and other
    employees with the talent and experience to manage and conduct
    our business effectively. They could also limit our tax
    deductions for certain compensation paid to executive employees
    in excess of specified amounts. We may also be subject to
    requirements and restrictions on our business if we participate
    in some of the programs established in whole or in part under
    EESA.



Changes
    in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations May
    Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability

Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to
    insurance products that are also “securities,”
    including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
    policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries
    and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance
    contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under
    these securities laws. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act. In addition, the variable annuity contracts and
    variable life insurance policies issued by the separate accounts
    are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act. Other
    subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under
    the Exchange Act, and are members of, and subject to, regulation
    by FINRA. Further, some of our subsidiaries are registered as
    investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers
    Act of 1940, and are also registered as investment advisers in
    various states, as applicable.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to
    protect investors in the securities markets, as well as protect
    investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and
    regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking
    and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict
    the conduct of business for failure to comply with the
    securities laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or
    regulations that restrict the conduct of our business could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. In particular, changes in the regulations
    governing the registration and distribution of variable
    insurance products, such as changes in the regulatory standards
    for suitability of variable annuity contracts or variable life
    insurance policies, or changes in the standard of care which
    sales representatives owe to their customers with respect to the
    sale of variable insurance products, could have such a material
    adverse effect.

Changes
    in Tax Laws, Tax Regulations, or Interpretations of Such Laws or
    Regulations Could Increase Our Corporate Taxes; Changes in Tax
    Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to
    Consumers

Changes in tax laws, Treasury and other regulations promulgated
    thereunder, or interpretations of such laws or regulations could
    increase our corporate taxes. The Obama Administration has
    proposed corporate tax changes. Changes in corporate tax rates
    could affect the value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax
    liabilities. Furthermore, the value of deferred tax assets could
    be impacted by future earnings levels.

Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less
    attractive to consumers. A shift away from life insurance and
    annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products would reduce
    our income from sales of these products, as well as the assets
    upon which we earn investment income. The Obama Administration
    has proposed certain changes to individual income tax rates and
    rules applicable to certain policies.

We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting
    corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted, what the
    specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether, if at
    all, any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We May
    be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
    Products

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. In addition, there is competition for
    representatives with other types of financial services firms,
    such as independent broker-dealers. We compete with other
    insurers for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our
    financial position, support services and compensation and
    product features. We continue to undertake several initiatives
    to grow our career agency force while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial condition could be



materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in
    attracting and retaining agents. See “Business —
    Competition.”

MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors May Control the Outcome of
    Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions
    of the MetLife Policyholder Trust

Under the Plan, we established the MetLife Policyholder Trust
    (the “Trust”) to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc.
    common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving
    cash or policy credits under the plan. At February 22,
    2010, 231,759,896 shares, or 28.3%, of the outstanding
    shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock, are held in the Trust.
    Because of the number of shares held in the Trust and the voting
    provisions of the Trust, the Trust may affect the outcome of
    matters brought to a stockholder vote.

Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions
    described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of
    common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the
    recommendations given by MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to its stockholders or, if the board gives no such
    recommendations, as directed by the board. As a result of the
    voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may be
    able to control votes on matters submitted to a vote of
    stockholders, excluding those fundamental corporate actions, so
    long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common
    stock.

If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified
    in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the
    Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in
    proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions
    include:

•

an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has
    properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a
    nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    or a vote on a stockholder’s proposal to oppose a board
    nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a
    vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders,
    subject to certain conditions;

•

a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
    substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or
    dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of
    stockholders under applicable Delaware law;

•

any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion
    of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities
    or other property; and

•

any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to amend or redeem the rights under the stockholder rights plan,
    other than a proposal with respect to which we have received
    advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that
    the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action
    under Delaware law.

If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions,
    the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by
    the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which
    will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually
    given by Trust beneficiaries.

State
    Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
    and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay, Deter or Prevent
    Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might
    Consider in Their Best Interests

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
    delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders
    might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may
    prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium
    over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence
    of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
    takeover attempts in the future.

Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would
    face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or
    prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc.
    might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance
    laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife,
    Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are



organized may delay or impede a business combination involving
    us. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring
    control of an insurance company without the prior approval of
    the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states’
    statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance
    company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the
    voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. We
    are also subject to banking regulations, and may in the future
    become subject to additional regulations. The Obama
    Administration and Congress have made various proposals that
    could restrict or impede consolidation, mergers and acquisitions
    by systemically significant firms

and/or

bank
    holding companies. In addition, the Investment Company Act would
    require approval by the contract owners of our variable
    contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any
    affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our
    variable contracts. Finally, FINRA approval would be necessary
    for a change of control of any FINRA registered broker-dealer
    that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested
    stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,
    including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional
    shares, for a period of three years following the time that the
    stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An
    “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons
    owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding
    voting stock of a corporation.

MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws
    also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a
    takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best
    interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include:
    classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into
    three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings
    by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of
    candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals
    to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority
    voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of
    the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

The stockholder rights plan, which was adopted by MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors in September 1999, might also
    have anti-takeover effects. The provisions of the rights plan
    might render an unsolicited takeover more difficult or less
    likely to occur or might prevent such a takeover, even though
    such takeover may offer MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders the
    opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing
    market price and may be favored by a majority of MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders. The rights plan is scheduled to expire
    at the close of business on April 4, 2010, and the Board of
    Directors does not currently intend to renew it.

The
    Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May
    Adversely Affect the Level of Claim Losses We Incur and the
    Value of Our Investment Portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States
    and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened
    security measures in response to these types of threats may
    cause significant volatility in global financial markets and
    result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions
    to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in
    our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines
    in the credit and equity markets and reduced economic activity
    caused by the continued threat of terrorism. We cannot predict
    whether, and the extent to which, companies in which we maintain
    investments may suffer losses as a result of financial,
    commercial or economic disruptions, or how any such disruptions
    might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or
    principal on their securities or mortgage loans. The continued
    threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance
    prices and reduced insurance coverage and potentially cause us
    to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were
    able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist actions
    also could disrupt our operations centers in the United States
    or abroad. In addition, the occurrence of terrorist actions
    could result in higher claims under our insurance policies than
    anticipated. See “— Difficult Conditions in the
    Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and
    These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future.”



The
    Occurrence of Events Unanticipated In Our Disaster Recovery
    Systems and Management Continuity Planning Could Impair Our
    Ability to Conduct Business Effectively

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
    epidemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus,
    a terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our
    disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to conduct business and on our results of
    operations and financial position, particularly if those
    problems affect our computer-based data processing,
    transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable
    data. We depend heavily upon computer systems to provide
    reliable service. Despite our implementation of a variety of
    security measures, our computer systems could be subject to
    physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from
    unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a
    significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event
    of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could
    be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere
    with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods and services
    and our employees’ ability to perform their job
    responsibilities.

Our
    Associates May Take Excessive Risks Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Financial Condition and Business

As an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of being paid
    to accept certain risks. The associates who conduct our
    business, including executive officers and other members of
    management, sales managers, investment professionals, product
    managers, sales agents, and other associates, do so in part by
    making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk.
    These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines
    and standards, product design and pricing, determining what
    assets to purchase for investment and when to sell them, which
    business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. Although
    we endeavor, in the design and implementation of our
    compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our
    associates incentives to take excessive risks, associates may
    take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation
    programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls
    and procedures designed to monitor associates’ business
    decisions and prevent us from taking excessive risks, there can
    be no assurance that these controls and procedures are or may be
    effective. If our associates take excessive risks, the impact of
    those risks could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition or business operations.

Item 2.

Properties

In 2006, we signed a lease for 410,000 rentable square feet
    on 12 floors in an office building in Manhattan, New York. The
    term of that lease commenced during 2008 and continues for
    21 years. In August 2009, we subleased 32,000 rentable
    square feet of that space to a subtenant, which has met our
    standards of review with respect to creditworthiness, and we
    currently have approximately 68,000 rentable square feet of
    the 410,000 rentable square feet available for sublease. We
    moved certain operations from our Long Island City, New York
    facility, to the Manhattan space in late 2008, but continue to
    maintain an on-going presence in Long Island City. Our lease in
    Long Island City covers 686,000 rentable square feet, under
    a long-term lease arrangement. In connection with the move of
    certain operations to Manhattan, in late 2008, we subleased
    80,000 rentable square feet to two subtenants, each of
    which has met our standards of review with respect to
    creditworthiness. Additionally, we currently have
    180,000 rentable square feet available for sublease in our
    Long Island City location. As a result of this movement of
    operations, and current market conditions, the Company incurred
    a lease impairment charge of $52 million and
    $38 million, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

In connection with the 2005 sale of the 200 Park Avenue
    property, we have retained rights to existing signage and are
    leasing space for associates in the property for 20 years
    with optional renewal periods through 2205.

We continue to own 15 other buildings in the United States that
    we use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain
    4.2 million rentable square feet and are located in the
    following states: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New
    Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
    Our computer center in



Rensselaer, New York is not owned in fee but rather is occupied
    pursuant to a long-term ground lease. We lease space in 755
    other locations throughout the United States, and these leased
    facilities consist of 8.8 million rentable square feet.
    Approximately 53% of these leases are occupied as sales offices
    for the U.S. Business Operations segment. The balance of
    space is utilized for MetLife Bank and other corporate functions
    supporting business activities. We also own 7 properties outside
    the United States, comprising 247,000 rentable square feet
    including a 192,000 square foot condominium unit in Mexico
    that we use in the operation of our business. We lease
    3.3 million rentable square feet in various locations
    outside the United States. We believe that these properties are
    suitable and adequate for our current and anticipated business
    operations.

We arrange for property and casualty coverage on our properties,
    taking into consideration our risk exposures and the cost and
    availability of commercial coverages, including deductible loss
    levels. In connection with the renewal of those coverages, we
    have arranged $700 million of property insurance, including
    coverage for terrorism, on our real estate portfolio through
    May 15, 2010, its renewal date.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

For purposes of this discussion, “MetLife” or the
    “Company” refers to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). Following this
    summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of
    operations and financial condition of the Company for the
    periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,”
    “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data”
    and the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    included elsewhere herein.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate
    by reference information that includes or is based upon
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements give expectations or forecasts of future events.
    These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not
    relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words
    such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms
    of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
    operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
    statements relating to future actions, prospective services or
    products, future performance



or results of current and anticipated services or products,
    sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as
    legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results.
    Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.
    Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or
    implied in the forward-looking statements. See “Note
    Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

The following discussion includes references to our performance
    measures operating earnings and operating earnings available to
    common shareholders, that are not based on generally accepted
    accounting principles in the United States of America
    (“GAAP”). Operating earnings is the measure of segment
    profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and
    allocate resources and, consistent with GAAP accounting guidance
    for segment reporting, is our measure of segment performance.
    Operating earnings is also a measure by which our senior
    management’s and many other employees’ performance is
    evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation
    under applicable compensation plans. Operating earnings is
    defined as operating revenues less operating expenses, net of
    income tax. Operating earnings available to common shareholders,
    which is used to evaluate the performance of Banking,
    Corporate & Other, as well as MetLife is defined as
    operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.

Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net
    investment gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of
    unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses),
    (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivative instruments that are hedges of investments but do not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income
    from discontinued real estate operations, and (v) plus, for
    operating joint ventures reported under the equity method of
    accounting, the aforementioned adjustments and those identified
    in the definition of operating expenses, net of income tax, if
    applicable to these joint ventures.

Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less
    changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to
    asset value fluctuations, (ii) less costs related to
    business combinations (since January 1, 2009) and
    noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of DAC
    and VOBA and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation
    related to net investment gains (losses), and (iv) plus
    scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments
    that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

We believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating
    earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for
    management purposes enhances the understanding of our
    performance by highlighting the results of operations and the
    underlying profitability drivers of our businesses. Operating
    earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders
    should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP income (loss) from
    continuing operations, net of income tax. Reconciliations of
    operating earnings and operating earnings available to common
    shareholders to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations,
    net of income tax, the most directly comparable GAAP measure,
    are included in “— Consolidated Results of
    Operations.”

Executive
    Summary

MetLife is a leading provider of insurance, employee benefits
    and financial services with operations throughout the United
    States and the Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle
    East and India (“EMEI”) regions. Through its
    subsidiaries, MetLife offers life insurance, annuities, auto and
    homeowners insurance, retail banking and other financial
    services to individuals, as well as group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions. MetLife is organized into
    five operating segments: Insurance Products, Retirement
    Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home
    (collectively, “U.S. Business”) and
    International. In addition, the Company reports certain of its
    results of operations in Banking, Corporate & Other,
    which is comprised of MetLife Bank and other business activities.

The U.S. and global financial markets experienced
    extraordinary dislocations during late 2008 through early 2009,
    with the U.S. economy entering a recession in January 2008.
    The economic crisis and the resulting recession have had an
    adverse effect on our financial results, as well as the
    financial services industry. Most economists believe the
    recession ended in the third quarter of 2009 when positive
    growth returned and now expect positive growth to continue
    through 2010. We have experienced an increase in market share
    and sales in some of our businesses from a flight to quality in
    the industry. In addition, the recovering global financial
    markets contributed to the improvement in net investment income
    and sales in most of our international regions. These positive
    impacts were outweighed by the adverse effects on our net
    investment income and the demand for certain of our products.



For a discussion of how the financial and economic environment
    has impacted our 2009 results, capital and liquidity, and
    expected 2010 performance, see “— Results of
    Operations,” “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” and “— Consolidated Company
    Outlook.”

Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared with the Year
    Ended December 31, 2008

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are net of income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax,
    decreased $5.8 billion to a loss of $2.3 billion from
    income of $3.5 billion in the comparable 2008 period. The
    year over year change is predominantly due to a
    $5.2 billion unfavorable change in net investment gains
    (losses) to losses of $4.6 billion, net of related
    adjustments, in 2009 from gains of $644 million, net of
    related adjustments, in 2008. In addition, operating earnings
    available to common shareholders decreased by $329 million
    to $2.4 billion in 2009 from $2.7 billion in 2008.

The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of
    $5.2 billion, net of related adjustments, was primarily
    driven by losses on freestanding derivatives, partially offset
    by gains on embedded derivatives, primarily associated with
    variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees, and lower losses on
    fixed maturity securities.

The positive impacts of business growth and favorable mortality
    in several of our businesses were more than offset by a decline
    in net investment income, resulting in a decrease in operating
    earnings of $329 million. The decrease in net investment
    income caused significant declines in the operating earnings of
    many of our businesses, especially the interest spread
    businesses. Also contributing to the decline in operating
    earnings was an increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit costs
    and a charge related to our closed block of business, a specific
    group of participating life policies that were segregated in
    connection with the demutualization of MLIC. The favorable
    impact of Operational Excellence, our enterprise-wide cost
    reduction and revenue enhancement initiative, was more than
    offset by higher pension and postretirement benefit costs,
    driving the increase in other expenses. The declines in
    operating earnings were partially offset by a change in
    amortization related to DAC, deferred sales inducement
    (“DSI”), and unearned revenue.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are net of income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax,
    decreased $624 million to $3.5 billion from
    $4.1 billion in the comparable 2007 period. The year over
    year change was predominantly due to a $1.9 billion
    decrease in operating earnings available to common shareholders.
    Partially offsetting this decline was a $1.1 billion
    favorable change in net investment gains (losses) to gains of
    $644 million, net of related adjustments, in 2008 from
    losses of $438 million, net of related adjustments, in 2007.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, there was unprecedented
    disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets that
    caused extreme volatility in the equity, credit and real estate
    markets. This adversely impacted both net investment income as
    yields decreased and net investment gains (losses) as there was
    an increase in impairments and credit-related losses.



We responded to the extraordinary market conditions by
    increasing levels of cash, cash equivalents, short-term
    investments and high quality, lower yielding fixed maturity
    securities particularly in two operating segments: Corporate
    Benefit Funding and Retirement Products, as well as in Banking,
    Corporate & Other. We decreased fixed maturity
    security holdings to increase our liquidity position.

The favorable change of $1.1 billion in net investment
    gains (losses), net of related adjustments, was driven by
    increased gains on freestanding derivatives, partially offset by
    increased losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated
    with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees, and increased
    impairment losses on fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities.

The unprecedented disruption and dislocation in the global
    financial markets resulted in decreased yields on our investment
    portfolio and, in response to the market conditions, we
    increased our asset allocation to lower yielding, more liquid
    investments, both of which contributed to a decline in net
    investment income and, consequently, operating earnings
    available to common shareholders. The market environment’s
    negative impact on investment results was partially offset by
    growth in average invested assets calculated excluding
    unrealized gains and losses. In addition, the volatile market
    environment also resulted in declines in our separate account
    balances. Such declines required us to increase DAC
    amortization, negatively affecting operating earnings available
    to common shareholders. The declines in the separate account
    balances also resulted in lower policy fees and other revenues.
    Operating earnings available to common shareholders for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 were also lower as a result of
    higher catastrophe losses and unfavorable mortality in various
    products. Higher earnings from our dental business and from our
    businesses in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions
    partially offset the aforementioned items.

Consolidated
    Company Outlook

In 2009, the general economic conditions of the marketplace,
    particularly in the early part of the year, continued to be
    volatile and negatively impacted the results of the Company. In
    2010, we expect meaningful earnings recovery for the Company,
    driven primarily by the following:

•

Continued growth in premiums, fees & other revenues

•

We expect top-line growth in 2010 of approximately 6% over 2009.
    We expect this growth will be driven by:

•

Higher fees earned on separate accounts, as the full impact of
    the recovery in the equity market is felt, thereby increasing
    the value of those separate accounts;

•

Increased sales in the pension closeout business, both in the
    United States and the United Kingdom, as the demand for these
    products rebounds from the lower levels seen in 2009;

•

Increases in our International segment, as a result of ongoing
    investments and improvements in the various distribution and
    service operations throughout the regions; and

•

Modest growth in Insurance products. Our growth continues to be
    impacted by the current higher levels of unemployment and it is
    possible that certain customers may further reduce or eliminate
    coverages in response to the financial pressures they are
    experiencing.

•

Offsetting these growth areas, MetLife Bank’s premiums,
    fees & other revenues are expected to decline from the
    2009 level, which benefited from the large number of mortgage
    refinancings in that year.

•

Higher returns on the investment portfolio

Despite expectations that the real estate market will remain
    challenging in 2010, higher returns on the investment portfolio
    are expected across all segments. We believe returns on
    alternative investment classes will improve and expect to
    reinvest cash and U.S. Treasuries into higher yielding
    asset classes.

•

Improvement in net investment gains (losses)

Although difficult to predict, net investment gains (losses) on
    our invested asset portfolio are expected to show significant
    improvement as the financial markets stabilize across asset
    classes, returning to a more normalized level from the large
    losses encountered in 2009. More difficult to predict is the
    impact of



potential changes in fair value of derivatives instruments as
    even relatively small movements in market variables, including
    interest rates, equity levels and volatility, can have a large
    impact on derivatives fair values. Additionally, changes in
    MetLife’s credit spread, may have a material impact on net
    investment gains (losses) as it is required to be included in
    the valuation of certain embedded derivatives.

•

Reduced volatility in guarantee-related liabilities

Certain annuity and life benefit guarantees are tied to market
    performance, which when markets are depressed, may require us to
    establish additional liabilities, even though these guarantees
    are significantly hedged. In line with the assumptions discussed
    above, we expect a significant reduction in the volatility of
    these items in 2010 compared to 2009.

•

Focus on disciplined underwriting

We do not expect any significant changes to the underlying
    trends that drive underwriting results and we anticipate solid
    results in 2010. While we did begin to see the negative impact
    of the economy on non-medical health experience in 2009, we
    expect to see improvement in our results in 2010 as the economy
    continues to improve. Pricing actions taken in 2009 in our
    dental business will help mitigate the impact of elevated claim
    utilization, experienced as a result of the challenging economic
    conditions and higher unemployment.

•

Focus on expense management

Our continued focus on expense control throughout the Company,
    as well the continuing impact of specific initiatives such as
    Operational Excellence (our enterprise-wide cost reduction and
    revenue enhancement initiative), should contribute to increased
    profitability. With continued improvement in the financial
    markets, we also expect that the Company’s pension-related
    expenses will return to a more normal level in 2010.

Industry
    Trends

The Company’s segments continue to be influenced by a
    continuing unstable financial and economic environment that
    affects the industry.

Financial and Economic Environment.

Our
    results of operations are materially affected by conditions in
    the global capital markets and the economy, generally, both in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world. The global
    economy and markets are now recovering from a period of
    significant stress that began in the second half of 2007 and
    substantially increased through the first quarter of 2009. This
    disruption adversely affected the financial services industry,
    in particular. The U.S. economy entered a recession in
    January 2008 and most economists believe this recession ended in
    the third quarter of 2009 when positive growth returned. Most
    economists now expect positive growth to continue through 2010.

Throughout 2008 and continuing in 2009, Congress, the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Treasury and other
    agencies of the Federal government took a number of increasingly
    aggressive actions (in addition to continuing a series of
    interest rate reductions that began in the second half of
    2007) intended to provide liquidity to financial
    institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor confidence
    in particular troubled institutions, to prevent or contain the
    spread of the financial crisis and to spur economic growth. How
    and to whom these governmental institutions distribute amounts
    available under the governmental programs could have the effect
    of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry
    more than others or provide advantages to some of our
    competitors. Governments in many of the foreign markets in which
    MetLife operates have also responded to address market
    imbalances and have taken meaningful steps intended to restore
    market confidence. As market conditions have stabilized, some of
    these programs have been terminated or allowed to expire. We
    cannot predict whether or when the U.S. or foreign
    governments will establish additional governmental programs or
    terminate or permit other programs to expire or the impact any
    additional measures, existing programs or termination or
    expiration of programs will have on the financial markets,
    whether on the levels of volatility currently being experienced,
    the levels of lending by financial institutions, the prices
    buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or otherwise. See
    “Business — Regulation — Governmental
    Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

The economic crisis and the resulting recession have had and
    will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results
    of companies in the financial services industry, including
    MetLife. The declining financial markets and economic conditions
    have negatively impacted our investment income, our net
    investment gains (losses), and



the demand for and the cost and profitability of certain of our
    products, including variable annuities and guarantee benefits.
    See ‘‘— Results of Operations” and
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Demographics.

In the coming decade, a key
    driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will
    be the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and needs
    of the retiring Baby Boomers. As a result of increasing
    longevity, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings
    to finance retirements that may span 30 or more years. Helping
    the Baby Boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and
    subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income
    represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry.

Life insurers are well positioned to address the Baby
    Boomers’ rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for
    income protection. We believe that, among life insurers, those
    with strong brands, high financial strength ratings and broad
    distribution, are best positioned to capitalize on the
    opportunity to offer income protection products to Baby Boomers.

Moreover, the life insurance industry’s products and the
    needs they are designed to address are complex. We believe that
    individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek
    information to plan for and manage their retirements and that,
    in the workplace, as employees take greater responsibility for
    their benefit options and retirement planning, they will need
    information about their possible individual needs. One of the
    challenges for the life insurance industry will be the delivery
    of this information in a cost effective manner.

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the
    turbulence in financial markets that began in the latter half of
    2008, its impact on the capital position of many competitors,
    and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have
    highlighted financial strength as the most significant
    differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain
    distributors. In addition, the financial market turbulence and
    the economic recession have led many companies in our industry
    to re-examine the pricing and features of the products they
    offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance
    industry.

Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the statutory
    reserve and capital requirements of the industry. In addition,
    regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of
    several markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products. The regulation of the
    financial services industry has received renewed scrutiny as a
    result of the disruptions in the financial markets in 2008 and
    2009. Significant regulatory reforms have been proposed and
    these or other reforms could be implemented. We cannot predict
    whether any such reforms will be adopted, the form they will
    take or their effect upon us. We also cannot predict how the
    various government responses to the recent financial and
    economic difficulties will affect the financial services and
    insurance industries or the standing of particular companies,
    including our Company, within those industries. See “Risk
    Factors — Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are
    Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our
    Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and “Risk
    Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State
    Securities Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and
    Our Profitability.”

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. The PPA is a comprehensive reform of
    defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules. The
    provisions of the PPA may, over time, have a significant impact
    on demand for pension, retirement savings, and lifestyle
    protection products in both the institutional and retail
    markets. While the impact of the PPA is generally expected to be
    positive over time, these changes may have adverse short-term
    effects on our business as plan sponsors may react to these
    changes in a variety of ways as the new rules and related
    regulations begin to take effect. In response to the current
    financial and economic



environment, President Bush signed into the law the Worker,
    Retiree and Employer Recovery Act (the “Employer Recovery
    Act”) in December 2008. This Act is intended to, among
    other things, ease the transition of certain funding
    requirements of the PPA for defined benefit plans. In addition,
    legislation that would provide further relief for defined
    benefit plans is under consideration. The financial and economic
    environment and the enactment of the Employer Recovery Act, as
    well as additional funding relief provisions that may be enacted
    into law, may delay the timing or change the nature of qualified
    plan sponsor actions and, in turn, affect our business.

Summary
    of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

(i)

the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted
    market values;

(ii)

investment impairments;

(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investment entities and the
    application of the consolidation rules to certain investments;

(iv)

the estimated fair value of and accounting for freestanding
    derivatives and the existence and estimated fair value of
    embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;

(v)

the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment
    and amortization of VOBA;

(vi)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(vii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits and the
    accounting for reinsurance contracts;

(viii)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(ix)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(x)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

In applying the Company’s accounting policies, we make
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Fair
    Value

The Company defines fair value as the price that would be
    received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an
    exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
    asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
    participants on the measurement date. In many cases, the exit
    price and the transaction (or entry) price will be the same at
    initial recognition. However, in certain cases, the transaction
    price may not represent fair value. The fair value of a
    liability is based on the amount that would be paid to transfer
    a liability to a third-party with the same credit standing. It
    requires that fair value be a market-based measurement in which
    the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction
    at the measurement date, considered from the perspective of a
    market participant. When quoted prices are not used to determine
    fair value, the Company considers three broad valuation
    techniques: (i) the market approach, (ii) the income
    approach, and (iii) the cost approach. The Company
    determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use,
    given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient
    inputs. The Company prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation
    techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the
    extent that observable inputs are not available. The Company
    categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated
    fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority
    of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair
    value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). An asset or



liability’s classification within the fair value hierarchy
    is based on the lowest level of input to its valuation. The
    input levels are as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other significant inputs that are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

Prior to January 1, 2009, the measurement and disclosures
    of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially
    measured at estimated fair value in a business combination,
    reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first
    step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for
    impairment assessment.

Estimated
    Fair Value of Investments

The Company’s investments in fixed maturity and equity
    securities, investments in trading securities, certain
    short-term investments, most mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are reported at
    their estimated fair value. In determining the estimated fair
    value of these investments, various methodologies, assumptions
    and inputs are utilized, as described further below.

When available, the estimated fair value of securities is based
    on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and
    regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of
    the Company’s securities holdings and valuation of these
    securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include,
    but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing of the
    issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon
    rate, call provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity,
    estimated duration and management’s assumptions regarding
    liquidity and estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, the
    estimated fair values are based on available market information
    and management’s judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity.



Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions
    deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing such
    securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

are determined based on observable pricing of residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted to convert
    the securities prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market
    prices are not available. When observable pricing for similar
    loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not
    available, the estimated fair values of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgage loans have also been
    designated as

held-for-sale

which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated
    fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an
    individual loan basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is
    determined using independent broker quotations or, when the loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
    estimated using internal models.

MSRs, which are recorded in other invested assets, are measured
    at estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated
    from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the
    servicing rights are retained by the Company. The estimated fair
    value of MSRs is principally determined through the use of
    internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various
    assumptions as to discount rates, loan-prepayments, and
    servicing costs. The use of different valuation assumptions and
    inputs, as well as assumptions relating to the collection of
    expected cash flows may have a material effect on the estimated
    fair values of MSRs.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

Investment
    Impairments

One of the significant estimates related to

available-for-sale

securities is the evaluation of investments for impairments. As
    described more fully in Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, effective April 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted new

other-than-temporary

impairments guidance that amends the methodology for determining
    for fixed maturity securities whether an

other-than-temporary

impairment exists, and for certain fixed maturity securities,
    changes how the amount of the

other-than-temporary

loss that is charged to earnings is determined. There was no
    change in the

other-than-temporary

impairment (“OTTI”) methodology for equity securities.
    The discussion presented below incorporates the new OTTI
    guidance adopted April 1, 2009.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on
    our

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of securities: (i) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and
    (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had
    declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater. An extended and severe
    unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not
    have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all
    scheduled interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity
    securities, greater weight and consideration are given by the
    Company to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood
    such estimated fair value decline will recover.

Additionally, we consider a wide range of factors about the
    security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates
    about the operations of the



issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations used by
    the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but
    are not limited to:

(i)

the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair
    value has been below cost or amortized cost;

(ii)

the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties;

(iii)

the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv)

the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed
    geographic locations;

(v)

the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer,
    series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type
    of loss or has exhausted natural resources;

(vi)

with respect to fixed maturity securities, whether the Company
    has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required
    to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in
    estimated fair value below cost or amortized cost;

(vii)

with respect to equity securities, whether the Company’s
    ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount
    equal to or greater than cost;

(viii)

unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed
    and asset-backed securities; and

(ix)

other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    the credit loss component of OTTI in the period in which the
    determination is made. When an OTTI of a fixed maturity security
    has occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings
    depends on whether the Company intends to sell the security or
    more likely than not will be required to sell the security
    before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the fixed
    maturity security meets either of these two criteria, the OTTI
    recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between
    the security’s amortized cost basis and its estimated fair
    value at the impairment measurement date. For

other-than-temporary

impairments of fixed maturity securities that do not meet either
    of these two criteria, the net amount recognized in earnings is
    equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the fixed
    maturity security and the present value of projected future cash
    flows to be collected from this security. Any difference between
    the estimated fair value and the present value of the expected
    future cash flows of the security at the impairment measurement
    date is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). For
    equity securities, the carrying value of the equity security is
    impaired to its estimated fair value, with a corresponding
    charge to earnings. The Company does not change the revised cost
    basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on
    other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based
    upon the Company’s periodic evaluation and assessment of
    known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset
    class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as
    conditions change and new information becomes available.

Recognition
    of Income on Certain Investment Entities

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain structured investment
    transactions, trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market
    conditions, which could result in prepayments and changes in
    amounts to be earned.

Application
    of the Consolidation Rules to Certain Investments

The Company has invested in certain structured transactions that
    are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). These
    structured transactions include reinsurance trusts, asset-backed
    securitizations, hybrid securities, joint ventures, limited
    partnerships and limited liability companies. The Company is
    required to consolidate those VIEs for which it is deemed to be
    the primary beneficiary. The accounting rules for the
    determination of when an entity is a VIE and when to consolidate
    a VIE are complex. The determination of the VIE’s primary
    beneficiary requires an evaluation



of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each
    party involved in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s
    expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation
    of such estimates to each party involved in the entity. The
    primary beneficiary is defined as the entity that will absorb a
    majority of a VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority of
    a VIE’s expected residual returns if no single entity
    absorbs a majority of expected losses, or both.

When assessing the expected losses to determine the primary
    beneficiary for structured investment products such as
    asset-backed securitizations and collateralized debt
    obligations, the Company uses historical default probabilities
    based on the credit rating of each issuer and other inputs
    including maturity dates, industry classifications and
    geographic location. Using computational algorithms, the
    analysis simulates default scenarios resulting in a range of
    expected losses and the probability associated with each
    occurrence. For other investment structures such as hybrid
    securities, joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited
    liability companies, the Company takes into consideration the
    design of the VIE and generally uses a qualitative approach to
    determine if it is the primary beneficiary. This approach
    includes an analysis of all contractual and implied rights and
    obligations held by all parties including profit and loss
    allocations, repayment or residual value guarantees, put and
    call options and other derivative instruments. If the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE can not be identified using this
    qualitative approach, the Company calculates the expected losses
    and expected residual returns of the VIE using a
    probability-weighted cash flow model. The use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of
    the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions
    including swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts to
    manage various risks relating to its ongoing business
    operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to synthetically
    replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily
    available in the cash market.

The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through
    the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives
    and financial forwards to sell certain to be announced
    securities or through the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.
    See Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional details on significant inputs into the

over-the-counter

derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under such accounting guidance. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and
    measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are
    also subject to interpretations and estimations and different
    interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the
    amount reported in net income.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefits. These include guaranteed minimum
    withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”), guaranteed minimum
    accumulation benefits (“GMAB”), and certain guaranteed
    minimum income benefits (“GMIB”). GMWB, GMAB and
    certain GMIB are embedded derivatives, which are measured at
    estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity
    product, with changes in estimated fair value reported in net
    investment gains (losses).



The estimated fair values for these embedded derivatives are
    determined based on the present value of projected future
    benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The
    projections of future benefits and future fees require capital
    market and actuarial assumptions including expectations
    concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the
    guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. Beginning in 2008, the
    valuation of these embedded derivatives includes an adjustment
    for the Company’s own credit and risk margins for
    non-capital market inputs. The Company’s own credit
    adjustment is determined taking into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt, as
    well as its claims paying ability. Risk margins are established
    to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which
    represent the additional compensation a market participant would
    require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such
    actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency,
    partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk
    margins requires the use of significant management judgment.

These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the
    Company’s own credit standing; and variations in actuarial
    assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB described in the preceding paragraphs. The value of the
    embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a
    methodology consistent with that described previously for the
    guarantees directly written by the Company.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is
    determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for the
    Company’s own credit that takes into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt, as
    well as its claims paying ability. Changes in equity and bond
    indices, interest rates and the Company’s credit standing
    may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the fair
    value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect
    net income.

The accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and
    interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to
    evolve in practice. If interpretations change, there is a risk
    that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation
    and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated
    financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair
    value could materially affect net income.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    represents the present value of future profits embedded in
    acquired insurance annuity and investment — type
    contracts. VOBA is based on actuarially determined projections,
    by each block of business, of future policy and contract
    charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account
    performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns
    and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business
    may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial statements for
    reporting purposes.

Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the Company’s accounting policy
    relating to DAC and VOBA amortization for various types of
    contracts.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. The Company’s practice to
    determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on
    separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation in equity
    markets is not changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is
    only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected. The
    Company monitors these changes and only changes the assumption
    when its long-term expectation changes. The effect of an
    increase/



(decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed future rate
    of return is reasonably likely to result in a
    decrease/(increase) in the DAC and VOBA amortization of
    approximately $140 million with an offset to the
    Company’s unearned revenue liability of approximately
    $20 million for this factor.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business. We
    annually update assumptions used in the calculation of estimated
    gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed.
    If the update of assumptions causes expected future gross
    margins and profits to increase, DAC and VOBA amortization will
    decrease, resulting in a current period increase to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to decrease.

Over the last several years, the Company’s most significant
    assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future
    gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA
    have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment
    returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and
    policyholder dividends on contracts included within the
    Insurance Products and Retirement Products segments. During
    2009, the amount of net investment gains (losses), as well as
    the level of separate account balances also resulted in
    significant changes to expected future gross margins and profits
    impacting amortization of DAC and VOBA. The Company expects
    these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause
    significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions
    can be offsetting and the Company is unable to predict their
    movement or offsetting impact over time.

Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements provides a rollforward of DAC and VOBA for the
    Company for each of the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, as well as a breakdown of DAC and VOBA by segment and
    reporting unit at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, DAC and VOBA for the Company
    was $19.3 billion and $20.1 billion, respectively. A
    substantial portion, approximately 84%, of the Company’s
    DAC and VOBA was associated with the Insurance Products and
    Retirement Products segments at December 31, 2009. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, DAC and VOBA for these segments
    was $16.1 billion and $17.4 billion, respectively.
    Amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the
    variable & universal life and the annuities contracts
    within the Insurance Products and Retirement Products segments
    are significantly impacted by movements in equity markets. The
    following chart illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA within
    the Company’s U.S. Business of changing each of the
    respective assumptions, as well as updating estimated gross
    margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Increases
    (decreases) in DAC and VOBA balances, as presented below, result
    in a corresponding decrease (increase) in amortization.

Prior to 2008, fluctuations in the amounts presented in the
    table above arose principally from normal assumption reviews
    during the period.



The following represents significant items contributing to the
    changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2009:

•

Actual gross profits decreased as a result of increased
    investment losses from the portfolios associated with the
    hedging of guaranteed insurance obligations on variable
    annuities, resulting in a decrease of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $141 million.

•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits increased as a result of a decrease in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities, resulting in an increase of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $995 million, excluding the impact from the
    Company’s own credit and risk margins, which are described
    below. This increase in actual gross profits was partially
    offset by freestanding derivative losses associated with the
    hedging of such guarantee obligations, which resulted in a
    decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization of $636 million.

–

The narrowing of the Company’s own credit spreads increased
    the valuation of guarantee liabilities, decreased actual gross
    profits and decreased DAC and VOBA amortization by
    $607 million. This was partially offset by lower risk
    margins which decreased the guarantee liability valuations,
    increased actual gross profits and increased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $20 million.

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses),
    which decreased DAC amortization by $484 million, was
    primarily attributable to current period investment activities.

•

Included in policyholder dividends and other was a decrease in
    amortization of $90 million as a result of changes to long
    term assumptions. The remainder of the decrease was due to
    various immaterial items.

The following represent significant items contributing to the
    changes to DAC and VOBA amortization in 2008:

•

The decrease in equity markets during the year significantly
    lowered separate account balances which lead to a significant
    reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal
    life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting
    in an increase of $708 million in DAC and VOBA amortization.

•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities resulting in a reduction of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $1,047 million. This decrease in actual gross profits
    was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with
    the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an
    increase in actual gross profits and an increase in DAC and VOBA
    amortization of $625 million.

–

The widening of the Company’s own credit spreads decreased
    the valuation of guarantee liabilities, increased actual gross
    profits and increased DAC and VOBA amortization by
    $739 million. This was partially offset by higher risk
    margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations,
    decreased actual gross profits and decreased DAC and VOBA
    amortization by $100 million.

–

Reductions in both actual and expected cumulative earnings of
    the closed block resulting from recent experience in the closed
    block combined with changes in expected dividend scales resulted
    in an increase in closed block DAC amortization of
    $195 million, $175 million of which was related to net
    investment gains (losses).

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses),
    which increased DAC amortization by $129 million, was
    attributable to numerous immaterial items.

•

Increases in amortization in 2008 resulting from changes in
    assumptions related to in-force/persistency of $159 million
    were driven by higher than anticipated mortality and lower than
    anticipated premium persistency during 2008.

The Company’s DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by
    unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of
    amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and
    losses had been recognized. The significant decrease in
    unrealized investment losses decreased the DAC and VOBA balance
    by $2.8 billion in 2009



whereas increases in unrealized investment losses increased the
    DAC and VOBA balance by $3.4 billion in 2008. Notes 3
    and 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    include the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized investment losses.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing
    during the third quarter of each year based upon data as of the
    close of the second quarter.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, a significant portion of goodwill
    within Banking, Corporate & Other is allocated to
    reporting units within our business segments.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
    there might be an indication of impairment. In such instances,
    the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a
    business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of
    goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized
    as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.

In performing our goodwill impairment tests, when we believe
    meaningful comparable market data are available, the estimated
    fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market
    multiple approach. When relevant comparables are not available,
    we use a discounted cash flow model. For reporting units which
    are particularly sensitive to market assumptions, such as the
    retirement products and individual life reporting units, we may
    corroborate our estimated fair values by using additional
    valuation methodologies.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value include projected operating
    earnings, current book value (with and without accumulated other
    comprehensive income), the level of economic capital required to
    support the mix of business, long term growth rates, comparative
    market multiples, the account value of in-force business,
    projections of new and renewal business, as well as margins on
    such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity market levels, and the discount rate we believe
    appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of the retirement products and
    individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to
    the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, we also consider our
    market capitalization in relation to our book value. We believe
    that our current market capitalization supports the value of the
    underlying reporting units.

We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated
    fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the
    relationship of market capitalization to the estimated fair
    value of our reporting units and their book value. The valuation
    methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and
    assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair
    value are inherently uncertain and represent only
    management’s reasonable expectation regarding future
    developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions
    upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood,
    differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in
    the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in
    goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially
    adversely affect our results of operations or financial position.

During our 2009 impairment tests of goodwill, we concluded that
    the fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their
    carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.
    However, we continue to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units to
    assess whether any goodwill impairment exists. Deteriorating or
    adverse market conditions for certain reporting units may have a
    significant impact on the estimated fair value of these
    reporting units and could result in future impairments of
    goodwill. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further consideration of goodwill
    impairment testing during 2009.



Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. These
    assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and
    are intended to estimate the experience for the period the
    policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions,
    liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If
    experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional
    liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to
    policyholder benefits and claims.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Other policyholder funds include claims that have been
    reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on
    life and non-medical health insurance. Liabilities for unpaid
    claims are estimated based upon the Company’s historical
    experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the
    effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk
    management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and
    subrogation. The effects of changes in such estimated
    liabilities are included in the results of operations in the
    period in which the changes occur.

Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income
    benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and
    secondary and paid-up guarantees relating to certain life
    policies are based on estimates of the expected value of
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal
    and variable life secondary guarantees and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent
    with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the
    same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment
    performance and volatility for variable products are consistent
    with historical S&P experience.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing of these policies and guarantees
    and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in
    variances in profit and could result in losses. The effects of
    changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the
    results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties. Accounting for reinsurance requires
    extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related
    to the future performance of the underlying business and the
    potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company
    periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared
    to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and
    liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and
    evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its
    reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated
    in the security impairment process discussed previously.
    Additionally, for each of its reinsurance agreements, the
    Company determines if the agreement provides indemnification
    against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in
    accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company
    reviews all contractual features, particularly those that may
    limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is
    subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of
    claims. If the



Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose
    the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss
    from insurance risk, the Company records the agreement using the
    deposit method of accounting.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the
    Company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing
    jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company
    provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently
    payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. The Company’s accounting for income taxes
    represents management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
    realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of
    sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward
    periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
    Valuation allowances are established when management determines,
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Factors in
    management’s determination consider the performance of the
    business including the ability to generate capital gains.
    Significant judgment is required in determining whether
    valuation allowances should be established, as well as the
    amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is
    recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is measured
    at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The
    Company may be required to change its provision for income taxes
    when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged
    by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining
    valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly
    change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need
    for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future
    events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or
    interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an
    impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax
    rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts
    reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year
    these changes occur.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements.
    The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. In
    consultation with our external consulting actuarial firm, we
    determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such
    as historical performance of the plan and its assets, currently
    available market and industry data, and expected benefit payout
    streams. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual
    results due to, among other factors, changing market and
    economic conditions and changes in participant demographics.
    These differences may have a significant effect on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements and liquidity.



Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including
    the Company’s asbestos-related liability, are especially
    difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data
    and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect
    liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the
    assumptions used to estimate the Company’s asbestos-related
    liability include the number of future claims, the cost to
    resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in
    pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new
    claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the
    law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible
    impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to
    allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the Company when
    exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos
    exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future
    adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual
    basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to
    liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and
    litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. It is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain of the Company’s
    litigation and regulatory investigations, including
    asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in
    the determination of amounts recorded could have a material
    effect upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash
    flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Economic
    Capital

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.
    This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk-based
    capital (“RBC”) formula, which is not as refined in
    its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the
    Company’s businesses.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Recent
    Developments

On February 2, 2010, MetLife announced that it is in discussions
    with American International Group, Inc. about acquiring its
    subsidiary, American Life Insurance Company, an international
    life insurance company. These discussions are ongoing. No
    agreement has been reached and there are no assurances that an
    agreement will be reached.

Consolidated
    Results of Operations

Year
    Ended December 31, 2009 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2008

Unfavorable market conditions continued through 2009, providing
    a challenging business environment. The largest and most
    significant impact continued to be on our investment portfolio
    as declining yields resulted in lower net investment income.
    Market sensitive expenses were also negatively impacted by the
    market conditions as evidenced by an increase in pension and
    postretirement benefit costs. Higher levels of unemployment
    continued to impact certain group businesses as a decrease in
    covered payrolls reduced growth. Our auto and homeowners
    business was impacted by a declining housing market, the
    deterioration of the new auto sales market and the continuation
    of credit availability issues, all of which contributed to a
    decrease in insured exposures. Despite the challenging business
    environment, revenue growth remained solid in the majority of
    our businesses. A flight to quality during the year contributed
    to an improvement in sales in both our domestic fixed and
    variable annuity products. We also saw an increase in market
    share, especially in the structured settlement business, where
    we experienced an increase of 53% in premiums. An improvement in
    the global financial markets contributed to a recovery of sales
    in most of our international regions and resulted in improved
    investment performance in some



regions during the second half of 2009. We also benefited
    domestically from a strong residential mortgage refinance market
    and healthy growth in the reverse mortgage arena.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are net of income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax
    decreased $5.8 billion to a loss of $2.3 billion from
    income of $3.5 billion in the comparable 2008 period. The
    year over year change is predominantly due to a
    $5.2 billion unfavorable change in net investment gains
    (losses) to losses of $4.6 billion, net of related
    adjustments, in 2009 from gains of $644 million, net of
    related adjustments, in 2008.



We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined
    Asset/Liability Management principles, focusing on cash flow and
    duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our
    intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash
    outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of
    comparable timing and amount, while optimizing, net of income
    tax, risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total
    return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward
    fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio
    invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. These
    securities and loans have varying maturities and other
    characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for
    matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities.
    Other invested asset classes including, but not limited to
    equity securities, other limited partnership interests and real
    estate and real estate joint ventures provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement
    in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives
    of our investment portfolio. We also use derivatives as an
    integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to
    hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates,
    foreign currencies, credit spreads and equity market levels.
    Additional considerations for our investment portfolio include
    current and expected market conditions and expectations for
    changes within our unique mix of products and business segments.

The composition of the investment portfolio of each business
    segment is tailored to the unique characteristics of its
    insurance liabilities, causing certain portfolios to be shorter
    in duration and others to be longer in duration. Accordingly,
    certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in fixed maturity
    securities, or certain

sub-sectors

of fixed maturity securities, than other portfolios.

Investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities
    and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However,
    net investment gains and losses are generated and can change
    significantly from period to period, due to changes in external
    influences including movements in interest rates, foreign
    currencies and credit spreads, counterparty specific factors
    such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral
    valuation, and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing
    that can generate gains and losses. As an investor in the fixed
    income, equity security, mortgage loan and certain other
    invested asset classes, we are exposed to the above stated
    risks, which can lead to both impairments and credit-related
    losses.

The unfavorable variance in net investment gains (losses) of
    $5.2 billion, net of related adjustments, was primarily
    driven by losses on freestanding derivatives, partially offset
    by gains on embedded derivatives associated with variable
    annuity minimum benefit guarantees, and decreased losses on
    fixed maturity securities. The negative change in freestanding
    derivatives, from gains in the prior year to losses in the
    current year, was primarily attributable to the effect of rising
    interest rates on certain interest rate sensitive derivatives
    that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and
    insurance liabilities; weakening U.S. Dollar on certain
    foreign currency sensitive derivatives, and equity market and
    interest rate derivatives that are economic hedges of embedded
    derivatives. Losses on embedded derivatives decreased from
    losses to gains and were driven primarily by rising interest
    rates and improving equity market performance. The gains were
    net of losses attributable to a narrowing of the Company’s
    own credit spread. Losses on the freestanding derivatives
    hedging these embedded derivatives risks substantially offset
    the change in the liabilities attributable to market factors,
    excluding the adjustment for the change in the Company’s
    own credit spread, which is not hedged. The decrease in losses
    on fixed maturity securities is primarily attributable to lower
    net losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, partially
    offset by increased impairments due to the current financial
    market conditions, although this trend lessened in the latter
    part of 2009.

As more fully described in the discussion of performance
    measures above, operating earnings is the measure of segment
    profit or loss we use to evaluate performance and allocate
    resources. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment
    reporting, it is our measure of performance, as reported below.
    Operating earnings is not determined in accordance with GAAP and
    should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP income (loss) from
    continuing operations, net of income tax. We believe that the
    presentation of operating earnings enhances the understanding of
    our performance by highlighting the results of operations and
    the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Operating
    earnings available to common shareholders decreased by
    $329 million to $2.4 billion in 2009 from
    $2.7 billion in 2008.

The volatile market conditions that began in 2008 and continued
    into 2009 impacted several key components of our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders including net
    investment income, hedging costs, and certain market sensitive
    expenses. The markets also positively impacted our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders as conditions began to
    improve during 2009, resulting in lower DAC and DSI amortization.

A $722 million decline in net investment income was the
    result of decreasing yields, including the effects of our higher
    quality, more liquid, but lower yielding investment position in
    response to the extraordinary market conditions. The impact of
    declining yields caused a $1.6 billion decrease in net
    investment income, which was partially offset by an increase of
    $846 million due to growth in average invested assets
    calculated excluding unrealized gains and losses. The decrease
    in yields resulted from the disruption and dislocation in the
    global financial markets experienced in 2008, which continued,
    but moderated, in 2009. The adverse yield impact was
    concentrated in the following four invested asset classes:

•

Fixed maturity securities — primarily due to lower
    yields on floating rate securities from declines in short-term
    interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding,
    higher quality, U.S. Treasury, agency and



government guaranteed securities, to increase liquidity in
    response to the extraordinary market conditions, as well as
    decreased income on our securities lending program, primarily
    due to the smaller size of the program in the current year.
    These adverse impacts were offset slightly as conditions
    improved late in 2009 and we began to reallocate our portfolio
    to higher-yielding assets;

•

Real estate joint ventures — primarily due to
    declining property valuations on certain investment funds that
    carry their real estate at estimated fair value and operating
    losses incurred on properties that were developed for sale by
    development joint ventures;

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments —
    primarily due to declines in short-term interest rates; and

•

Mortgage loans — primarily due to lower prepayments on
    commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on variable rate
    loans reflecting declines in short-term interest rates.

Equity markets experienced some recovery in 2009, which led to
    improved yields on other limited partnership interests. As many
    of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was significantly offset by lower interest
    credited expense on our investment and insurance products.

The financial market conditions also resulted in a
    $348 million increase in net guaranteed annuity benefit
    costs in our Retirement Products segment, as increased hedging
    losses were only partially offset by lower guaranteed benefit
    costs.

The key driver of the increase in other expenses stemmed from
    the impact of market conditions on certain expenses, primarily
    pension and postretirement benefit costs, reinsurance expenses
    and letter of credit fees. These increases coupled with higher
    variable costs, such as commissions and premium taxes, some of
    which have been capitalized, more than offset the favorable
    impact of lower information technology, travel, professional
    services and advertising expenses, which include the impact of
    our Operational Excellence initiative.

The market improvement which began in the second quarter of 2009
    was a key factor in the determination of our expected future
    gross profits, the increase of which triggered a decrease in DAC
    and DSI amortization, most significantly in the Retirement
    Products segment. The increase in our expected future gross
    profits stemmed primarily from an increase in the market value
    of our separate account balances, which is attributable, in
    part, to the improving financial markets. Our Insurance Products
    segment benefited, in the current year, from an increase in
    amortization of unearned revenue, primarily as a result of our
    annual review of assumptions that are used in the determination
    of the amount of amortization recognized. These collective
    changes in amortization resulted in a $720 million benefit,
    partially offsetting the declines in operating earnings
    available to common shareholders discussed above.

A portion of the decline in operating earnings available to
    common shareholders was caused by a $200 million reduction
    in the results of our closed block of business, a specific group
    of participating life policies that were segregated in
    connection with the demutualization of MLIC. Until early 2009,
    the operating earnings of the closed block did not have a full
    impact on operating earnings as the operating earnings or loss
    was partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend
    obligation, a liability established at the time of
    demutualization. However, in early 2009 the policyholder
    dividend obligation was depleted and, as a result, the total
    operating earnings or loss related to the closed block for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 was, and in the future may be
    a component of operating earnings.

Business growth, from the majority of our businesses, along with
    net favorable mortality experience, had a positive impact on
    operating earnings available to common shareholders. These
    impacts were somewhat dampened by higher benefit utilization in
    our dental business and mixed claim activity in our Auto &
    Home segment. In addition, our forward and reverse residential
    mortgage platform acquisitions in late 2008 benefited Banking,
    Corporate & Other’s 2009 results.

Unfavorable market conditions, which continued through 2009,
    provided a challenging business environment for our Insurance
    Products segment. This resulted in lower net investment income
    and an increase in market sensitive expenses, primarily pension
    and postretirement benefit costs. We also experienced higher
    utilization of dental benefits along with a lower number of
    recoveries in our disability business. Higher levels of
    unemployment continued to impact certain group businesses as a
    decrease in covered payrolls reduced growth. However, revenue
    growth remained solid in all of our businesses. Revenue growth
    in our dental and individual life businesses reflected strong
    sales and renewals.

The significant components of the $168 million decline in
    operating earnings were the aforementioned decline in net
    investment income, especially in the closed block business,
    partially offset by an increase in the amortization of unearned
    revenue, the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain
    policyholders and favorable mortality in the individual life
    business.

Until early 2009, the earnings of the closed block did not have
    a full impact on operating earnings as the earnings or loss was
    partially offset by a change in the policyholder dividend
    obligation. However, in early 2009 the policyholder dividend
    obligation was depleted and, as a result, the total operating
    earnings or loss related to the closed block for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was, and in the future may be, a
    component of operating earnings. This resulted in a
    $200 million decline in operating earnings in 2009.

The decrease in net investment income of $112 million was
    primarily due to a $317 million decrease from lower yields,
    partially offset by a $205 million increase from growth in
    average invested assets. Yields were adversely impacted by the
    severe downturn in the global financial markets, which primarily
    impacted other invested assets, real estate joint ventures and
    fixed maturity securities. In addition, income from our
    securities lending program decreased primarily due to the
    smaller size of the program in 2009. The growth in the average
    invested asset base was primarily from an increase in net flows
    from our individual life, non-medical health, and group life
    businesses. The moderate recovery in equity markets in 2009 led
    to improved yields on other limited partnership interests, which
    partially offset the overall reduction in yields. To manage the
    needs of our intermediate to longer-term liabilities, our
    portfolio consists primarily of investment grade corporate fixed
    maturity securities, structured finance securities (comprised of
    mortgage and asset-backed securities), mortgage loans, and
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed fixed
    maturity securities and, to a lesser extent, certain other
    invested asset classes



including real estate joint ventures and other invested assets
    to provide additional diversification and opportunity for
    long-term yield enhancement.

Other expenses were essentially flat despite an increase of
    $137 million from the impact of market conditions on
    certain expenses, primarily pension and postretirement benefit
    costs. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of
    $85 million, predominantly from declines in information
    technology, travel, and professional services, including the
    positive impact of our Operational Excellence initiative. A
    further reduction of expenses was achieved through a decrease in
    variable expenses, such as commissions and premium taxes of
    $46 million, a portion of which is offset by DAC
    capitalization.

The aforementioned declines in operating earnings were partially
    offset by the favorable impact of a $63 million decrease in
    policyholder dividends in the traditional life business, the
    result of a dividend scale reduction in the fourth quarter of
    2009. In addition, favorable mortality in the individual life
    business was partially offset by higher benefit utilization in
    the dental business during 2009, reflecting the negative
    employment trends in the marketplace. The net impact of these
    two items benefited operating earnings by $36 million. The
    2009 results were also favorably impacted by our review of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins, which in turn are factors in determining the
    amortization for DAC and unearned revenue. This review resulted
    in an unlocking event related to unearned revenue and, coupled
    with the impact from the prior year’s review, generated an
    increase in operating earnings of $82 million. This
    increase was recorded in universal life and investment-type
    product policy fees. Partially offsetting these increases was
    the impact of lower separate account balances, which resulted in
    lower fee income of $25 million.

DAC amortization reflects lower current year amortization of
    $108 million, stemming from the impact of the improvement
    in the financial markets in 2009, which increased our expected
    future gross profits, as well as lower current year gross
    margins in the closed block. This decrease was partially offset
    by the net impact of refinements in both the prior and current
    years of $98 million, the majority of which was recorded in
    the prior year as a result of the 2008 review of certain DAC
    related assumptions.

In 2009, Retirement Products benefited from a flight to quality,
    which contributed to a 10% improvement in combined sales of our
    fixed and variable products and a 28% reduction in surrenders
    and withdrawals. Our variable



annuity sales have out paced the industry, increasing our market
    share. Fixed annuity sales benefited from enhanced marketing on
    our income annuity with life contingency products, which
    increased our premium revenues by $262 million, or 73%,
    before income taxes. In the annuity business, the movement in
    premiums is almost entirely offset by the related change in
    policyholder benefits, as the insurance liability that we
    establish at the time we assume the risk under these contracts
    is typically equivalent to the premium earned less the amount of
    acquisition expenses. Our average policyholder account balances
    grew by $7.2 billion in 2009, primarily due to an increase
    in sales of fixed annuity products and more customers electing
    the fixed option on variable annuity sales. This has a favorable
    impact on earnings by increasing net investment income, which is
    somewhat offset by higher interest credited expense. Unfavorable
    market conditions resulted in poor investment performance, which
    outweighed the impact of higher variable annuity sales on our
    separate account balances causing the average separate account
    balance to remain lower than the previous year. This resulted in
    lower policy fees and other revenues which are based on daily
    asset balances in the policyholder separate accounts.

The improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver
    of the $144 million increase in operating earnings, with
    the largest impact resulting in a decrease in DAC, VOBA and DSI
    amortization of $655 million. The 2008 results reflected
    increased, or accelerated, amortization primarily stemming from
    a decline in the market value of our separate account balances.
    A factor that determines the amount of amortization is expected
    future earnings, which in the annuity business are derived, in
    part, from fees earned on separate account balances. The market
    value of our separate account balances declined significantly in
    2008, resulting in a decrease in the expected future gross
    profits, triggering an acceleration of amortization in 2008.
    Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, the market conditions
    began to improve and the market value of our separate account
    balances began to increase, resulting in an increase in the
    expected future gross profits and a corresponding lower level of
    amortization in 2009.

Also contributing to the increase in operating earnings was an
    increase in net investment income of $321 million, which
    was primarily due to a $343 million increase from growth in
    average invested assets, partially offset by a $22 million
    decrease in yields. The increase in average invested assets was
    due to increased cash flows from the sales of fixed annuity
    products and more customers electing the fixed option on
    variable annuity sales, which were reinvested primarily in fixed
    maturity securities, other invested assets and mortgage loans.
    Yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the
    global financial markets which primarily impacted real estate
    joint ventures, fixed maturity securities and cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments. The moderate improvement
    in the equity markets in 2009 led to an increase in yields on
    other limited partnership interests and certain other invested
    assets, which partially offset the overall reduction in yields.
    To manage the needs of our intermediate to longer-term
    liabilities, our portfolio consists primarily of investment
    grade corporate fixed maturity securities, structured finance
    securities, mortgage loans and U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities and, to a lesser
    extent, certain other invested asset classes, including real
    estate joint ventures in order to provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement.
    As is typically the case with fixed annuity products, higher net
    investment income was somewhat offset by higher interest
    credited expense. Growth in our fixed annuity policyholder
    account balances increased interest credited expense by
    $177 million in 2009 and higher average crediting rates on
    fixed annuities increased interest credited expense by
    $37 million.

Operating earnings were negatively impacted by $348 million
    of operating losses related to the hedging programs for variable
    annuity minimum death and income benefit guarantees, which are
    not embedded derivatives, partially offset by a decrease in the
    liability established for these variable annuity guarantees. The
    various hedging strategies in place to offset the risk
    associated with these variable annuity guarantee benefits were
    more sensitive to market movements than the liability for the
    guaranteed benefit. Market volatility, improvements in the
    equity markets, and higher interest rates produced operating
    losses on these hedging strategies in the current year. Our
    hedging strategies, which are a key part of our risk management,
    performed as anticipated. The decrease in annuity guarantee
    benefit liabilities was due to the improvement in the equity
    markets, higher interest rates and the annual unlocking of
    future market expectations.

Other expenses increased by $221 million primarily due to
    an increase of $122 million from the impact of market
    conditions on certain expenses. These expenses are largely
    comprised of reinsurance costs, pension and postretirement
    benefit expenses, and letter of credit fees. In addition,
    variable expenses, such as commissions and premium taxes,
    increased $76 million, the majority of which have been
    offset by DAC capitalization. The positive



impact of our Operational Excellence initiative was reflected in
    lower information technology, travel, professional services and
    advertising expenses, but was more than offset by increases
    largely due to business growth.

Finally, policy fees and other revenues decreased by
    $100 million, mainly due to lower average separate account
    balances in the current year versus prior year.

Corporate Benefit Funding benefited in certain markets in 2009
    as a flight to quality helped drive our increase in market
    share, especially in the structured settlement business, where
    we experienced a 53% increase in premiums. Our pension closeout
    business in the United Kingdom continues to expand and
    experienced premium growth during 2009 of almost
    $400 million, or 105% before income taxes. However, this
    growth was more than offset by a decline in our domestic pension
    closeout business driven by unfavorable market conditions and
    regulatory changes. A combination of poor equity returns and
    lower interest rates have contributed to pension plans being
    under funded, which reduces our customers’ flexibility to
    engage in transactions such as pension closeouts. Our
    customers’ plans funded status may be affected by a variety
    of factors, including the ongoing phased implementation of the
    Pensions Protection Act of 2006. For each of these businesses,
    the movement in premiums is almost entirely offset by the
    related change in policyholder benefits. The insurance liability
    that is established at the time we assume the risk under these
    contracts is typically equivalent to the premium earned.

Market conditions also contributed to a lower demand for several
    of our investment-type products. The decrease in sales of these
    investment-type products is not necessarily evident in our
    results of operations as the transactions related to these
    products are recorded through the balance sheet. Our funding
    agreement products, primarily the London

Inter-Bank

Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) based contracts, experienced the
    most significant impact from the volatile market conditions. As
    companies seek greater liquidity, investment managers are
    refraining from repurchasing the contracts when they mature and
    are opting for more liquid investments. In addition, unfavorable
    market conditions continued to impact the demand for global
    guaranteed interest contracts, a type of funding agreement.

Policyholder account balances for our investment-type products
    were down by approximately $10 billion during 2009, as
    issuances were more than offset by scheduled maturities.
    However, due to the timing of issuances



and maturities, the average policyholder account balances and
    liabilities increased from 2008 to 2009. The impact of the
    decrease in policyholder account balances resulted in lower net
    investment income, which was somewhat offset by lower interest
    credited expense.

The primary driver of the $362 million decrease in
    operating earnings was lower net investment income of
    $720 million reflecting a $732 million decrease from
    lower yields and a $12 million increase due to growth in
    average invested assets. Yields were adversely impacted by the
    severe downturn in the global financial markets which impacted
    real estate joint ventures, fixed maturity securities, other
    invested assets and mortgage loans. In addition, income from our
    securities lending program decreased, primarily due to the
    smaller size of the program during the year. To manage the needs
    of our longer-term liabilities, our portfolio consists primarily
    of investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities,
    mortgage loans, U.S. Treasury, agency and government
    guaranteed securities and, to a lesser extent, certain other
    invested asset classes including real estate joint ventures in
    order to provide additional diversification and opportunity for
    long-term yield enhancement. For our shorter-term obligations,
    we invest primarily in structured finance securities, mortgage
    loans and investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities.
    The yields on these investments have moved consistent with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR and Treasury, on
    which they are based. The growth in the average invested asset
    base is consistent with the increase in the average policyholder
    account balances and liabilities.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was somewhat offset by lower net interest
    credited expense of $382 million. The decrease in interest
    credited expense is attributed to $438 million from lower
    crediting rates. Crediting rates have moved consistent with the
    underlying market indices, primarily LIBOR, on which they are
    based. The increase in the average policyholder account balances
    resulted in a $56 million increase in interest credited
    expense.

The year over year decline in operating earnings was also due in
    part to lower other revenues as the prior year benefited by
    $44 million in fees for the cancellation of a bank owned
    life insurance stable value wrap policy combined with the
    surrender of a global guaranteed interest contract. In addition,
    a refinement to a reinsurance recoverable in the small business
    record keeping line of business in the latter part of 2009 also
    contributed $20 million to the decrease in operating
    earnings.

Current year results benefited from favorable liability
    refinements as compared to unfavorable liability refinements in
    2008, as well as improved mortality experience in the current
    year, all in the pension closeouts business. These items
    improved 2009 operating earnings by approximately
    $90 million. Other products generated mortality gains or
    losses; however, the net change did not have a material impact
    on our year over year results.

Although our other expenses only increased marginally and are
    not a significant driver of the decrease in operating earnings,
    the general themes associated with the increase are consistent
    with those factors discussed above in the discussion of our
    consolidated results of operations. Market conditions triggered
    an increase in our pension and postretirement benefit expenses
    of $27 million. In addition, variable expenses, such as
    commissions and premium taxes, have increased $8 million.
    These increases were partially offset by a decrease of
    $30 million, primarily in information technology, travel
    and professional services expenses, all of which were largely
    due to our Operational Excellence initiative.

Auto & Home was negatively impacted in 2009 by a
    declining housing market, the deterioration of the new auto
    sales market and the continuation of credit availability issues,
    all of which contributed to a decrease in insured exposures in
    2009. Average premiums per policy increased slightly for our
    homeowners’ policies but decreased for auto policies,
    primarily as a result of a business shift in insured exposures
    by state. In particular, we experienced a large decrease in
    earned exposures in Massachusetts, whose market was impacted by
    a regulatory change, which resulted in a marked increase in
    competition.

A return to more normal weather conditions in 2009 resulted in
    fewer, and less severe, catastrophe events than in 2008. This
    was more than offset by an increase in both non-catastrophe
    claim frequencies and non-catastrophe claim severities in 2009.

Mixed claim experience and the impact of lower exposures were
    the primary drivers of the $41 million decrease in
    operating earnings. While we had a $90 million decrease in
    catastrophe related losses compared to the prior year, we also
    recorded $68 million less of a benefit in 2009 from
    favorable development of prior year non-catastrophe losses.
    Current year claim costs rose primarily as a result of a
    $29 million increase in claim frequency from both our auto
    and homeowners products. In addition, we had a $15 million
    net increase in claim severity, stemming from higher severity in
    our auto line of business that was partially offset by lower
    severity in our homeowners line of business. In 2009, we
    experienced a decline in insured exposures, which contributed
    approximately $16 million to the decrease in operating
    earnings. While this decrease in exposures had a positive impact
    on the amount of claims, it was more than offset by the negative
    impact on premiums. The decrease in exposures is largely
    attributable to slightly higher non-renewal rates, partially
    offset by greater sales of new policies. Also contributing to
    the decline in earnings was a decrease of $9 million in the
    average premium per policy, which is primarily due to a shift in
    earned exposures to lower average premium states and an increase
    of $10 million in loss adjustment expenses, primarily
    related to a decrease in unallocated loss adjusting expense
    liabilities at the end of 2008.

The impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the
    unfavorable change in the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, to 88.9% in 2009 from 83.1% in 2008 and the
    unfavorable change in the combined ratio, including
    catastrophes, to 92.3% in 2009 from 91.2% in 2008.

A $25 million decrease in other expenses, including the net
    change in DAC, partially offset the declines in operating
    earnings discussed above. This improvement resulted from
    decreases in sales related expenses and from minor fluctuations
    in a number of expense categories, a portion of which is due to
    our Operational Excellence initiative.



Also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was a
    decline in net investment income of $4 million which was
    primarily due to a $9 million decrease from a decline in
    average invested assets, partially offset by an increase of
    $5 million due to improved yields.

An improvement in the global financial markets has contributed
    to a recovery of sales in the majority of our International
    regions and has resulted in improved investment performance in
    some regions during the second half of 2009. Sales in our Asia
    Pacific region are down primarily from a decrease in variable
    annuity sales in Japan, primarily as a result of pricing actions
    we took during the latter half of 2009. This decline was
    somewhat offset by growth in South Korea’s fixed annuities
    product and an increase of variable universal life sales, which
    are indications that markets are beginning to recover. We
    experienced growth in the pension, group life, and medical
    businesses of our Latin America region, specifically in Mexico.
    Our EMEI region continues to have strong growth in the European
    variable annuity business. As we continue to focus on our
    business in India, we have made significant investments in our
    distribution capabilities.

The reduction in operating earnings includes the adverse impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in 2009 as the
    U.S. Dollar strengthened against the various foreign currencies.
    This decreased operating earnings by $99 million in 2009
    relative to 2008. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, operating earnings increased
    $83 million, or 22%, from the prior year. This increase was
    primarily driven by higher operating earnings of
    $184 million in our Asia Pacific region, while operating
    earnings from our Latin America and EMEI regions decreased by
    $83 million and $18 million, respectively.

Asia Pacific Region.

Improving financial
    market conditions was the primary driver of the increase in
    operating earnings. Net investment income in the region
    increased by $422 million due to an increase of
    $278 million from improved yields on our investment
    portfolio, $111 million from the change in results of
    operating joint ventures, and $33 million from an increase
    in average invested assets. The increase in yields was primarily
    due to higher income of $277 million on the trading
    securities portfolio, stemming from equity markets experiencing
    some recovery in 2009. As our trading securities portfolio backs
    unit-linked policyholder liabilities, this increase in income
    was entirely offset by a corresponding increase in interest
    credited expense. The income of the Japan joint venture improved
    by $103 million due to favorable investment results and
    lower amortization of



DAC and VOBA. The decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization was
    primarily due to an increase in the market value of the joint
    venture’s separate account balances, which is directly tied
    to the improving financial markets. A factor that determines the
    amount of DAC and VOBA amortization is expected future fees
    earned on separate account balances. Since the market value of
    separate account balances have increased, it is expected that
    future earnings on this block of business will be higher than
    previously anticipated. As a result, the amortization of DAC and
    VOBA was less in the current year.

Operating earnings in this region also benefited from higher
    surrender charges of $16 million. Difficult economic
    conditions in Korea during the first half of the year resulted
    in a higher level of surrenders. Growth in our Japan reinsurance
    business and an increase in reinsurance rates contributed
    $21 million to the increase in operating earnings. In
    addition, the favorable impact of a reduction in the liability
    for our variable annuity guarantees contributed $22 million
    to operating earnings. The change in the liability was primarily
    due to an increase in separate account balances in the Japan
    joint venture. These liabilities are accrued over the life of
    the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy
    assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits
    generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns.
    The scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with
    those used to amortize DAC. Because separate account balances
    have had positive returns relative to the prior year, current
    estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously
    projected which resulted in a decrease in this liability in the
    current period. Partially offsetting these increases, higher DAC
    amortization of $49 million resulted from business growth
    and favorable investment results.

Latin America Region.

The decrease in
    operating earnings was primarily driven by lower net investment
    income. Net investment income decreased by $297 million due
    to a decrease of $383 million from lower yields, partially
    offset by an increase of $86 million due to an increase in
    average invested assets. The decrease in yields was due, in
    part, to the impact of changes in assumptions for measuring the
    effects of inflation on certain inflation-indexed fixed maturity
    securities. This decrease was partially offset by a reduction of
    $221 million in the related insurance liability primarily
    due to lower inflation. The increase in net investment income
    attributable to an increase in average invested assets was
    primarily due to business growth and, as such, was largely
    offset by increases in policyholder benefits and interest
    credited expense.

Higher claim experience in Mexico resulted in a $45 million
    decline in operating earnings. The nationalization and reform of
    the pension business in Argentina impacted both the current year
    and prior year earnings, resulting in a net $36 million
    decline in operating earnings. In addition, operating earnings
    decreased due to a net income tax increase of $8 million in
    Mexico, resulting from a change in assumption regarding the
    repatriation of earnings, partially offset by the favorable
    impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2009.

Partially offsetting these decreases in operating earnings was
    the combination of growth in Mexico’s individual and
    institutional businesses and higher premium rates in its
    institutional business, which increased operating earnings by
    $51 million. Pesification in Argentina impacted both the
    current year and prior year earnings, resulting in a net
    $73 million increase in operating earnings. This benefit
    was largely due to a reassessment of our approach in managing
    existing and potential future claims related to certain social
    security pension annuity contract holders in Argentina resulting
    in a liability release. Lower expenses of $8 million
    resulted primarily from the impact of operational efficiencies
    achieved through our Operational Excellence initiative.

EMEI Region.

The impact of foreign currency
    transaction gains and a tax benefit, both of which occurred in
    the prior year, contributed $12 million to the decline in
    operating earnings. Our investment of $9 million in our
    distribution capability and growth initiatives in 2009 also
    reduced operating earnings. There was an increase in net
    investment income of $76 million, which was due to an
    increase of $65 million from an improvement in yields and
    $11 million from an increase in average invested assets.
    The increase in yields was primarily due to favorable results on
    the trading securities portfolio, stemming from the equity
    markets experiencing some recovery in 2009. As our trading
    portfolio backs unit-linked policyholder liabilities, the
    trading portfolio results were entirely offset by a
    corresponding increase in interest credited expense. The
    increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in
    average invested assets was primarily due to business growth and
    was largely offset by increases in policyholder benefits and
    interest credited expense, also due to business growth.

Banking, Corporate & Other recognized the full year
    impact of our forward and reverse residential mortgage platform
    acquisitions, a strong residential mortgage refinance market,
    healthy growth in the reverse mortgage arena, and a favorable
    interest spread environment. Our forward and reverse residential
    mortgage production of $37.4 billion in 2009 is up 484%
    compared to 2008 production. The increase in mortgage production
    drove higher investments in residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

and mortgage servicing rights. At December 31, 2009, our
    residential mortgage loans servicing portfolio was
    $64.1 billion comprised of agency (FNMA, FHLMC, and GNMA)
    portfolios. Transaction and time deposits, which provide a
    relatively stable source of funding and liquidity and are used
    to fund loans and fixed income securities purchases, grew 48% in
    2009 to $10.2 billion. Borrowings decreased 10% in 2009 to
    $2.4 billion. During 2009, we participated in the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York Term Auction Facility, which provided
    short term liquidity with low funding costs.

In response to the economic crisis and unusual financial market
    events that occurred in 2008 and continued into 2009, we decided
    to utilize excess debt capacity. The Holding Company completed
    three debt issuances in 2009. The Holding Company issued
    $397 million of floating rate senior notes in March 2009,
    $1.3 billion of senior notes in May 2009, and
    $500 million of junior subordinated debt securities in July
    2009. In February 2009, in connection with the initial
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts issued as part of the
    common equity units sold in June 2005, the Holding Company
    issued common stock for $1.0 billion. The proceeds from
    these equity and debt issuances were used for general corporate
    purposes and have resulted in increased investments and cash and
    cash equivalents held within Banking, Corporate &
    Other.

Operating earnings available to common shareholders improved by
    $114 million, of which $254 million was due to MetLife
    Bank and its acquisitions of a residential mortgage origination
    and servicing business and a reverse mortgage business, both
    during 2008. Excluding the impact of MetLife Bank, our operating
    earnings available to common shareholders decreased
    $140 million, primarily due to lower net investment income,
    partially offset by the impact of a lower effective tax rate.
    The lower effective tax rate provided an increased benefit of
    $139 million from the prior year. This benefit was the
    result of a partial settlement of certain prior year tax audit
    issues and increased utilization of tax preferenced investments,
    which provide tax credits and deductions.



Excluding a $68 million increase from MetLife Bank, net
    investment income decreased $283 million, which was
    primarily due a decrease of $287 million due to lower
    yields, partially offset by an increase of $4 million due
    to an increase in average invested assets. Consistent with the
    consolidated results of operations discussion above, yields were
    adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the global
    financial markets, which primarily impacted fixed maturity
    securities and real estate joint ventures. The increased average
    invested asset base was due to cash flows from debt issuances
    during 2009. Our investments primarily include structured
    finance securities, investment grade corporate fixed maturity
    securities, U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed
    fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans. In addition, our
    investment portfolio includes the excess capital not allocated
    to the segments. Accordingly, it includes a higher allocation to
    certain other invested asset classes to provide additional
    diversification and opportunity for long-term yield enhancement
    including leveraged leases, other limited partnership interests,
    real estate, real estate joint ventures and equity securities.

After excluding the impact of a $394 million increase from
    MetLife Bank, other expenses increased by $20 million.
    Deferred compensation costs, which are tied to equity market
    performance, were higher due to a significant market rebound. We
    also had an increase in costs associated with the implementation
    of our Operational Excellence initiative. These increases were
    partially offset by lower postemployment related costs and
    corporate-related expenses, specifically legal costs. Legal
    costs were lower largely due to the prior year commutation of
    asbestos policies. In addition, interest expense declined
    slightly as a result of rate reductions on variable rate
    collateral financing arrangements offset by debt issuances in
    2009 and 2008.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts are net of income tax.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, MetLife’s
    income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax,
    decreased $624 million to $3.5 billion from
    $4.1 billion in the comparable 2007 period. The year over
    year change was predominantly due to a $1.9 billion
    decrease in operating earnings available to common shareholders.
    Partially offsetting this decline was a $1.1 billion
    favorable change in net investment gains (losses) to gains of
    $644 million, net of related adjustments, in 2008 from
    losses of $438 million, net of related adjustments, in 2007.

Beginning in the third quarter of 2008, there was unprecedented
    disruption and dislocation in the global financial markets that
    caused extreme volatility in the equity, credit and real estate
    markets. This adversely impacted net investment income as market
    yields decreased and portfolio yields decreased from an
    increased allocation to lower yielding, more liquid investments.
    The adverse impact on net investment gains (losses) from
    increased impairments and credit-related realized losses was
    more than offset by favorable market value changes in derivative
    instruments.

The increase in net investment gains of $1.1 billion, net
    of related adjustments, was primarily driven by increased gains
    on freestanding derivatives, partially offset by increased
    losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated with
    variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees, and increased
    impairment losses on fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities. The increased gains on freestanding derivatives were
    from certain interest sensitive derivatives that are economic
    hedges of certain invested assets and liabilities; gains from
    foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the
    U.S. Dollar strengthening; and gains from equity and
    interest rate derivatives that are economic hedges of embedded
    derivatives. Losses on embedded derivatives increased and were
    driven by declining interest rates and poor equity market
    performance, and were net of gains attributable to a widening in
    the Company’s own credit spread. The gains on freestanding
    derivatives hedging these embedded derivative risks
    substantially offset the change in the liabilities attributable
    to market factors, excluding the adjustment for the change in
    the Company’s own credit spread, which is not hedged. The
    increased impairment losses on fixed maturity and equity
    securities were primarily associated with financial services
    industry holdings due to the stress in the global financial
    markets, as well as other credit-related impairments due to the
    lack of intent to hold or uncertainty on intent to hold certain
    securities until recovery of market value declines.

Unprecedented disruption and dislocation in the global financial
    markets caused extreme volatility in the equity, credit and real
    estate markets during 2008. Consequently, we experienced
    decreasing yields on our investment portfolio and, in response
    to the extraordinary market conditions, we increased our
    allocation to lower yielding, more liquid investments, causing a
    $1.4 billion decline in net investment income. This decline
    was



partially offset by growth in average invested assets calculated
    excluding unrealized gains and losses. The adverse yield impact
    was concentrated in the following four invested asset classes:

•

Other limited partnership interests — primarily due to
    the lack of liquidity and credit in the financial markets, as
    well as unprecedented investor redemptions in an environment
    with steep declines in the public equity and debt markets;

•

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments —
    primarily due to declines in short-term interest rates;

•

Fixed maturity securities — primarily due to lower
    yields on floating rate securities due to declines in short-term
    interest rates and an increased allocation to lower yielding,
    higher quality, U.S. government and agency securities, to
    increase liquidity in response to the extraordinary market
    conditions; and

•

Real estate joint ventures — primarily due to
    declining property valuations on certain investment funds that
    carry their real estate at estimated fair value and operating
    losses incurred on properties that were developed for sale by
    real estate development joint ventures.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was significantly offset by lower interest
    credited expense on our investment and insurance products. In
    addition to its impact on net investment income, the volatile
    market environment also negatively impacted operating earnings
    through an increase in DAC amortization, most significantly in
    the Retirement Products segment. The acceleration of
    amortization stemmed primarily as a result of the decline in the
    market value of our separate account balances, which is directly
    tied to the financial markets. Lower separate account balances
    also resulted in a decrease in policy fees and other revenues.

Unfavorable mortality experience in the group and individual
    life businesses and unfavorable claims experience in the
    non-medical health and other business reduced operating earnings
    in our Insurance Products segment. Also contributing to the
    decrease in operating earnings available to common shareholders
    was the impact of significant weather-related catastrophe
    losses, which were somewhat offset by lower non-catastrophe
    losses in our Auto & Home segment. Lastly, the
    implementation of our Operational Excellence initiative resulted
    in higher postemployment costs in Banking, Corporate &
    Other.

Higher earnings from our dental business as well as from our
    businesses in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions
    partially offset the unfavorable impacts discussed above. In
    addition, our banking acquisitions in 2008, discussed under
    “Acquisitions and Dispositions,” improved operating
    earnings available to common shareholders in Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

Extreme volatility in the equity, credit and real estate markets
    resulted in decreasing yields on our investment portfolio
    causing net investment income to decline by $190 million
    despite growth in average invested assets. The market
    environment had its most significant impact on other limited
    partnership interests, real estate joint ventures and fixed
    maturity securities. Net investment income from the general
    account portion of investment-type products, including variable
    universal life, group life and certain non-medical health
    products decreased by $135 million, while other businesses,
    including traditional life, decreased by $55 million.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was significantly offset by lower interest
    credited expense on our investment and insurance products,
    reducing its impact on operating earnings which declined
    $64 million compared to 2007. Also contributing to the
    decline in operating earnings was unfavorable mortality
    experience in the group and individual life businesses,
    unfavorable claims experience in the non-medical health business
    and the resulting impact of the decline in the financial markets
    on separate account balances. Such decreases were partially
    offset by higher earnings in the dental and group term life
    businesses, including the favorable impact on the year over year
    variance of the adoption of new accounting guidance for DAC on
    internal replacements of insurance contracts in the prior year.

The unprecedented disruption and dislocation in the global
    financial markets that began in the third quarter of 2008
    negatively impacted many aspects of our business resulting in a
    $696 million decrease in operating earnings, despite new
    sales and deposits which continue to grow consistent with
    expectations.

The largest impact resulting from the challenging market
    conditions was an increase in DAC and DSI amortization of
    $385 million. The acceleration of amortization resulted
    primarily from the decline in the market value of our separate
    account balances, which is directly tied to the financial
    markets. A factor that determines the amount of amortization is
    expected future earnings, which in this annuity business are
    derived, in part, from fees earned on separate account balances.
    In 2008, projection of separate account fees were reduced and as
    a result, we recognized more amortization in the current period.
    The lower market value of our separate account balances also
    resulted in a $96 million decrease in policy fees and other
    revenues. Policy fees from variable investment-type products are
    typically calculated as a percentage of the daily asset balance
    in the policyholder accounts. The value of these assets can
    fluctuate depending on performance of the equity markets.

Also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was a
    decline in net investment income of $244 million, which was
    primarily due to decreasing yields on our investment portfolio
    and an increased allocation to lower yielding more liquid
    investments in response to the extraordinary market conditions.
    Yields were adversely impacted by the severe downturn in the
    global financial markets which impacted other limited
    partnership interests, and cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments.

Partially offsetting the market-related declines was
    $15 million of lower expenses. A decrease in non-deferrable
    volume related expenses was partially offset by the impact of
    revisions to certain pension and postretirement liabilities in
    2008. The increase in the pension and postretirement liabilities
    was the result of a decline in the value of the assets
    supporting the liabilities. The decline in the asset value is
    also a direct impact of the volatile market conditions.

Decreasing yields on our other limited partnership interests,
    real estate joint ventures and fixed maturity securities caused
    by the severe downturn in the global financial markets resulted
    in a $495 million decrease in net investment income, and
    was the primary reason for the $297 million decline in
    operating earnings.

As many of our products are interest spread-based, the lower net
    investment income was somewhat offset by lower interest credited
    expense on our investment-type contracts of $276 million.
    In addition, a charge of $75 million related to a liability
    refinement in the pension closeout business and an increase in
    interest credited on future policyholder benefits, which is
    consistent with an aging block of business, contributed to the
    decline in operating earnings. Such declines were partially
    offset by fees earned of $28 million on the surrender of a
    global funding agreement contract in 2008.

Significant weather-related catastrophe losses in the second and
    third quarters of 2008 were the primary cause for the
    $63 million decline in operating earnings and resulted in
    an unfavorable change in the combined ratio, including
    catastrophes, to 91.2% in 2008 from 88.4% in 2007. Such losses
    were partially offset by a decrease in non-catastrophe losses
    due to lower severities in the auto line of business, offset
    somewhat by higher frequencies in the homeowners line of
    business, which is reflected in the favorable change in the
    combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, to 83.1% in 2008 from
    86.3% in 2007.

In addition, net investment income decreased by $7 million
    primarily due to decreasing yields, partially offset by growth
    in average invested assets. Yields were adversely impacted by
    the severe downturn in the global financial markets which
    impacted other limited partnership interests and fixed maturity
    securities.

Finally, earned premiums were impacted by a modest increase in
    exposures, a decrease in the cost of reinsurance, and a decline
    in average earned premium per policy.

The reduction in operating earnings includes the adverse impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased
    operating earnings by $11 million relative to 2007.
    Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates, operating earnings decreased by $78 million, or 14%,
    from the comparable 2007 period. This decrease was primarily
    driven by difficult financial market conditions in Japan, which
    adversely impacted investment results and increased DAC
    amortization relative to the prior year, as well as the impact
    of pension reform in Argentina in 2007 and the nationalization
    of this business in 2008, which favorably impacted the prior
    year results relative to the current year. Partially offsetting
    these decreases, the International segment benefited from the
    favorable impact of higher inflation rates on inflation-indexed
    investments in Chile, as well as business growth in the Latin
    America and Asia Pacific regions.

As a result of the extraordinary market conditions that began in
    late 2008, we experienced decreasing yields on our other limited
    partnership interests and cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments. The decreased yields resulted in a
    $403 million decrease in investment results, despite the
    positive impact of a higher asset base resulting from the
    investment of a portion of the proceeds from debt issuances in
    2008 and late 2007. These lower investment results were the
    primary driver of the $667 million decline in operating
    earnings available to common shareholders as compared to 2007.

Increases in interest expense, corporate expenses and legal
    costs also contributed to the decline in operating earnings
    (loss). Higher interest expense was the result of the various
    debt issuances in 2008 and late 2007. The implementation of our
    Operational Excellence initiative resulted in higher
    postemployment related costs. In addition, corporate support
    expenses, including incentive compensation, rent, advertising,
    and information technology costs, were higher than in 2007.
    Lastly, legal costs were higher due primarily to the commutation
    of three asbestos-related excess insurance policies. The
    increases in these corporate expenses were partially offset by a
    reduction in deferred compensation costs.

Banking results improved operating earnings by $21 million
    primarily due to the acquisitions made by MetLife Bank in 2008.
    See Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material
    effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar
    as inflation may affect interest rates.



Inflation in the United States has remained contained and been
    in a general downtrend for an extended period. However, in light
    of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus
    measures by the U.S. federal government and foreign
    governments, it is possible that inflation could increase in the
    future. An increase in inflation could affect our business in
    several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed
    income investments falls which could increase realized and
    unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor
    and other materials, potentially putting pressure on
    profitability if such costs can not be passed through in our
    product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for
    losses and loss adjustment expenses in our Auto & Home
    business, which could require us to adjust our pricing to
    reflect our expectations for future inflation. If actual
    inflation exceeds the expectations we use in pricing our
    policies, the profitability of our Auto & Home
    business would be adversely affected. Prolonged and elevated
    inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the
    economy generally, and dispelling it may require governments to
    pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could
    constrain overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and
    reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities.

Investments

Investment Risks.

The Company’s primary
    investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax,
    risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return
    while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The Company is exposed to four primary
    sources of investment risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the
    continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of
    principal and interest;

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow
    variability associated with changes in market interest rates;

•

liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell
    certain investments in times of strained market
    conditions; and

•

market valuation risk, relating to the variability in the
    estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in
    market factors such as credit spreads.

The Company manages risk through in-house fundamental analysis
    of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and
    real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk,
    market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and
    issuer diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and
    agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and market
    valuation risk through geographic, property type and product
    type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages
    interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management
    strategies; product design, such as the use of market value
    adjustment features and surrender charges; and proactive
    monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of
    its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and
    dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The
    Company also uses certain derivative instruments in the
    management of credit and interest rate risks.

Current Environment.

Precipitated by housing
    sector weakness and severe market dislocations, the
    U.S. economy entered its worst post-war recession in
    January 2008. Most economists believe this recession ended
    in third quarter 2009 when positive growth returned. Most
    economists now expect positive growth to continue through 2010.
    However, the expected recovery is weaker than normal, and the
    unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time.
    Although the disruption in the global financial markets has
    moderated, not all global financial markets are functioning
    normally, and many remain reliant upon government intervention
    and liquidity.

As a result of this unprecedented disruption and market
    dislocation, we have experienced both volatility in the
    valuation of certain investments and decreased liquidity in
    certain asset classes. Securities that are less liquid are more
    difficult to value and have fewer opportunities for disposal.
    Even some of our very high quality assets have been more
    illiquid for periods of time as a result of the recent
    challenging market conditions. These market conditions had also
    led to an increase in unrealized losses on fixed maturity and
    equity securities in recent quarters, particularly for
    residential and commercial mortgage-backed, asset-backed and
    corporate fixed maturity securities and within the
    Company’s financial services industry fixed maturity and
    equity securities holdings. During 2009,



unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities
    decreased from improving market conditions, including narrowing
    of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity.

Investment
    Outlook

Although we anticipate that the volatility in the equity, credit
    and real estate markets will moderate slightly in 2010, it could
    continue to impact net investment income and the related yields
    on private equity funds, hedge funds and real estate joint
    ventures, included within our other limited partnership
    interests and real estate and real estate joint venture
    portfolios. Further, in light of the current market conditions,
    liquidity will be reinvested in a prudent manner and invested
    according to our ALM discipline in appropriate assets over time.
    Until the additional liquidity is reinvested, the Company will
    have a slightly higher than normal level of short-term
    liquidity. Net investment income may be adversely affected if
    the reinvestment process occurs over an extended period of time
    due to challenging market conditions or asset availability.

Fixed
    Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale

Fixed maturity securities, which consisted principally of
    publicly-traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities,
    were $227.6 billion and $188.3 billion, or 67% and 58%
    of total cash and invested assets at estimated fair value, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Publicly-traded
    fixed maturity securities represented $191.4 billion and
    $156.7 billion, or 84% and 83% of total fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Privately placed fixed maturity
    securities represented $36.2 billion and
    $31.6 billion, or 16% and 17% of total fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively.

Equity securities, which consisted principally of
    publicly-traded and privately-held common and preferred stocks,
    including certain perpetual hybrid securities and mutual fund
    interests, were $3.1 billion and $3.2 billion, or 0.9%
    and 1.0% of total cash and invested assets at estimated fair
    value, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Publicly-traded equity securities represented $2.1 billion
    and $2.1 billion, or 68% and 66% of total equity securities
    at estimated fair value, at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Privately-held equity securities represented
    $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, or 32% and 34% of total
    equity securities at estimated fair value, at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Valuation of Securities.

We are responsible
    for the determination of estimated fair value. The estimated
    fair value of publicly-traded fixed maturity, equity and trading
    securities, as well as short-term securities is determined by
    management after considering one of three primary sources of
    information: quoted market prices in active markets, independent
    pricing services, or independent broker quotations. The number
    of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends on the
    liquidity of the particular instrument. Generally, we obtain
    prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes
    and obtain multiple prices for certain securities, but
    ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the
    fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing services that value
    these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies
    based on inputs that are market observable or can be derived
    principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Such
    observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets
    in active, liquid markets, quoted prices in markets that are not
    active and observable yields and spreads in the market. The
    market standard valuation methodologies utilized include:
    discounted cash flow methodologies, matrix pricing or similar
    techniques. The assumptions and inputs in applying these market
    standard valuation methodologies include, but are not limited
    to, interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or
    counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated
    duration, and management’s assumptions regarding liquidity
    and estimated future cash flows. When a price is not available
    in the active market or through an independent pricing service,
    management will value the security primarily using independent
    non-binding broker quotations. Independent non-binding broker
    quotations utilize inputs that are not market observable or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data.

Senior management, independent of the trading and investing
    functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems
    and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new
    transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable
    market prices and market-based parameters are used for
    valuation, wherever possible, and for determining that
    judgmental valuation adjustments, if any, are based upon
    established policies and are applied consistently over time. We
    review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and
    ensure that any changes to valuation methodologies are
    justified. We gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and
    consistent application of input assumptions, valuation
    methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair
    value determination through various controls designed to ensure
    that the financial assets and financial liabilities are
    appropriately valued and represent an exit price. The control
    systems and procedures include, but are not limited to, analysis
    of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns,
    comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the
    fair value estimates, comparing fair value estimates to
    management’s knowledge of the current market, reviewing the
    bid/ask spreads to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that
    independent pricing services use, wherever possible,
    market-based parameters for valuation. We determine the
    observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received
    from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing
    whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market
    data. The Company also follows a formal process to challenge any
    prices received from independent pricing services that are not
    considered representative of estimated fair value. If we
    conclude that prices received from independent pricing services
    are not reflective of market activity or representative of
    estimated fair value, we will seek independent non-binding
    broker quotes or use an internally



developed valuation to override these prices. Such overrides are
    classified as Level 3. Despite the credit events prevalent
    in the current markets, including market dislocation, volatility
    in valuation of certain investments, and reduced levels of
    liquidity over the past few quarters, our internally developed
    valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect our
    estimates of liquidity and non- performance risks, compared with
    pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not
    produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed
    maturity securities portfolio. Our estimates of liquidity and
    non-performance risks are generally based on available market
    evidence and on what other market participants would use. In the
    absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is
    used. As a result, we generally continued to use the price
    provided by the independent pricing service under our normal
    pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material. The
    Company uses the results of this analysis for classifying the
    estimated fair value of these instruments in Level 1, 2 or
    3. For example, we will review the estimated fair values
    received to determine whether corroborating evidence (i.e.,
    similar observable positions and actual trades) will support a
    Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy.
    Security prices which cannot be corroborated due to relatively
    less pricing transparency and diminished liquidity will be
    classified as Level 3. Even some of our very high quality
    invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a
    result of the current market conditions.

For privately placed fixed maturity securities, the Company
    determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix
    pricing or discounted cash flow techniques. The discounted cash
    flow valuations rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the
    security, credit spreads of comparable public securities and
    secondary transactions, as well as taking account of, among
    other factors, the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced
    liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities.

The Company has reviewed the significance and observability of
    inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the
    appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its
    securities. Based on the results of this review and investment
    class analyses, each instrument is categorized as Level 1,
    2 or 3 based on the priority of the inputs to the respective
    valuation methodologies. While prices for certain
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed fixed
    maturity securities, certain foreign government fixed maturity
    securities, exchange-traded common stock and certain short-term
    money market securities have been classified into Level 1
    because of high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid/ask
    spreads, most securities valued by independent pricing services
    have been classified into Level 2 because the significant
    inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or
    can be corroborated using market observable information. Most
    investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities have
    been classified within Level 2, while most below investment
    grade or distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities
    have been classified within Level 3. Where estimated fair
    values are determined by independent pricing services or by
    independent non-binding broker quotations that utilize inputs
    that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally
    from or corroborated by observable market data, these
    instruments have been classified as Level 3. Use of
    independent non-binding broker quotations generally indicates
    there is a lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency
    in the process to develop these price estimates causing them to
    be considered Level 3.

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted new accounting
    guidance that clarified existing guidance regarding
    (1) estimating the estimated fair value of an asset or
    liability if there was a significant decrease in the volume and
    level of trading activity for these assets or liabilities and
    (2) identifying transactions that are not orderly. The
    Company’s valuation policies as described above and in
    “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Estimated Fair Values of Investments”
    already incorporated the key concepts from this additional
    guidance, accordingly, this guidance results in no material
    changes in our valuation policies. At April 1, 2009 and at
    each subsequent quarterly period in 2009, we evaluated the
    markets that our fixed maturity and equity securities trade in
    and in our judgment, despite the increased illiquidity discussed
    above, believe none of these fixed maturity and equity
    securities trading markets should be characterized as distressed
    and disorderly. We will continue to re-evaluate and monitor such
    fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets on an
    ongoing basis.

The composition of fair value pricing sources for and
    significant changes in Level 3 securities at
    December 31, 2009 are as follows:

•

The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity and equity
    securities (89.7%, as presented above) were concentrated in four
    sectors: U.S. and foreign corporate securities, ABS and
    RMBS.



•

Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally
    through independent broker quotations or market standard
    valuation methodologies using inputs that are not market
    observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated
    by observable market data. Level 3 fixed maturity
    securities consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities
    with very limited trading activity or where less price
    transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation
    methodologies including newly issued agency-backed RMBS yet to
    be priced by independent sources, below investment grade private
    placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities
    (included in U.S. and foreign corporate securities) and
    less liquid ABS including securities supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans (included in ABS).

•

During the year ended December 31, 2009, Level 3 fixed
    maturity securities decreased by $218 million, or 1.3%.
    Favorable estimated fair value changes recognized in other
    comprehensive income (loss) were partially offset by transfers
    out primarily concentrated in foreign corporate securities and
    to a lesser extent net sales and settlements in excess of
    purchases and realized and unrealized losses included in
    earnings. The increase in estimated fair value in fixed maturity
    securities was concentrated in U.S. and foreign corporate
    securities and ABS (including RMBS backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans) due to improving market conditions including the
    narrowing of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in
    liquidity, offset slightly by the effect of rising interest
    rates on such securities. The transfers out of Level 3 are
    described in the discussion following the rollforward table
    below. Net sales and settlements in excess of purchases of fixed
    maturity securities were concentrated in U.S. and foreign
    corporate securities. The realized and unrealized losses
    included in earnings were primarily due to OTTI credit losses,
    including OTTI credit losses on perpetual hybrid securities
    included in U.S. and foreign corporate securities.

A rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities measured at estimated fair
    value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable
    (Level 3) inputs for the year ended December 31,

An analysis of transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2009 is as
    follows:

•

Total gains and losses in earnings and other comprehensive
    income (loss) are calculated assuming transfers in or out of
    Level 3 occurred at the beginning of the period. Items
    transferred in and out for the same period are excluded from the
    rollforward.

•

Total gains and losses for fixed maturity securities included in
    earnings of ($241) million and other comprehensive income
    (loss) of $169 million respectively, were incurred for
    transfers subsequent to their transfer to Level 3, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009.

•

Net transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 for fixed maturity securities were
    ($1,543) million for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    and was comprised of transfers in of $3,490 million and
    transfers out of ($5,033) million, respectively.



Overall, transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 are attributable to a change in the
    observability of inputs. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, fixed maturity securities transfers out of Level 3 of
    $5,033 million resulted primarily from increased
    transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance
    and establishment of trading activity, became priced by pricing
    services and existing issuances that, over time, the Company was
    able to corroborate pricing received from independent pricing
    services with observable inputs, primarily for U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, fixed maturity securities transfers into
    Level 3 of $3,490 million resulted primarily from
    current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading
    activity, decreased liquidity, fixed maturity securities going
    into default and credit ratings downgrades (e.g., from
    investment grade to below investment grade). These current
    market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of
    valuations and an increased use of broker quotations and
    unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value
    principally for U.S. and foreign corporate securities.

See “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Estimated Fair Value of Investments”
    for further information on the estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported above.

Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Quality —
    Ratings.

The Securities Valuation Office of the
    NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of
    insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment
    purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality
    categories called “NAIC designations.” The NAIC
    ratings are generally similar to the rating agency designations
    of the NRSRO for marketable fixed maturity securities. NAIC
    ratings 1 and 2 include fixed maturity securities generally
    considered investment grade (i.e. rated “Baa3” or
    better by Moody’s or rated “BBB” or better by
    S&P and Fitch), by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings
    3 through 6 include fixed maturity securities generally
    considered below investment grade (i.e. rated “Ba1” or
    lower by Moody’s, or rated “BB+” or lower by
    S&P and Fitch), by such rating organizations.

The NAIC adopted a revised rating methodology for non-agency
    RMBS that became effective December 31, 2009. The
    NAIC’s objective with the revised rating methodology for
    non-agency RMBS was to increase the accuracy in assessing
    expected losses, and to use the improved assessment to determine
    a more appropriate capital requirement for non-agency RMBS. The
    revised methodology reduces regulatory reliance on rating
    agencies and allows for greater regulatory input into the
    assumptions used to estimate expected losses from non-agency
    RMBS.

The following three tables present information about the
    Company’s fixed maturity securities holdings by credit
    quality ratings. Amounts presented for non-agency RMBS,
    including RMBS backed by sub-prime mortgage loans reported
    within ABS, held by the Company’s domestic insurance
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 are based on final
    ratings from the revised NAIC rating methodology which became
    effective December 31, 2009. Comparisons between NAIC
    ratings and rating agency designations are published by the
    NAIC. The rating agency designations were based on availability
    of applicable ratings from those rating agencies on the NAIC
    acceptable rating organizations list. If no rating is available
    from a rating agency, then an internally developed rating is
    used.



The following table presents the Company’s total fixed
    maturity securities by NRSRO designation and the equivalent
    ratings of the NAIC, as well as the percentage, based on
    estimated fair value, that each designation is comprised of at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, with the exception of
    non-agency RMBS held by the Company’s domestic insurance
    subsidiaries at December 31, 2009, which are presented as

RMBS.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements “Investments —
    Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale —

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — RMBS” for the tables that present
    the Company’s RMBS holdings by security type and risk
    profile at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The majority of the Company’s RMBS were rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch; and the majority were rated
    NAIC 1 by the NAIC at December 31, 2009 and 2008, as
    presented above. Effective December 31, 2009, the NAIC
    adopted a revised rating methodology for non-agency RMBS based
    on the NAIC’s estimate of expected losses from non-agency
    RMBS. The majority of the Company’s agency RMBS were
    guaranteed or otherwise supported by the FNMA, the FHLMC or the
    GNMA. Non-agency RMBS includes prime and Alt-A RMBS. Prime
    residential mortgage lending includes the origination of
    residential mortgage loans to the most credit-worthy borrowers
    with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A are a classification of
    mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls
    between prime and

sub-prime.

Sub-prime

mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage
    loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. During 2009, the
    major rating agencies made significant revisions to their
    methodologies and loss expectations for non-agency RMBS,
    resulting in significant downgrades for both prime and Alt-A
    RMBS, contributing to the decrease in the percentage of RMBS
    with Aaa/AAA ratings at December 31, 2009 as compared to
    December 31, 2008. Our analysis suggests that rating
    agencies are applying essentially the same default methodology
    to all Alt-A securities regardless of the underlying collateral.
    The Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has superior
    structure to the overall Alt-A market. At December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has no
    exposure to option adjustable rate mortgages (“ARMs”)
    and a minimal exposure to hybrid ARMs. The Company’s Alt-A
    securities portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed rate
    mortgages which have performed better than both option ARMs and
    hybrid ARMs in the overall Alt-A market. Additionally, 90% and
    83% at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of the
    Company’s Alt-A securities portfolio has super senior
    credit enhancement, which typically provides double the credit
    enhancement of a standard Aaa/AAA rated fixed maturity security.
    Based upon the analysis of the Company’s exposure to Alt-A



mortgage loans through its exposure to RMBS, the Company
    continues to expect to receive payments in accordance with the
    contractual terms of the securities that are considered
    temporarily impaired. Any securities where the present value of
    projected future cash flows expected to be collected is less
    than amortized cost are impaired in accordance with our
    impairment policy. See Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements “Investments —
    Fixed Maturity Securities

Available-for-Sale —

RMBS” for a table that presents the estimated fair value of
    Alt-A securities held by the Company by vintage year, net
    unrealized loss, portion of holdings rated Aa/AA or better by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, portion rated NAIC 1 by the
    NAIC, and portion of holdings that are backed by fixed rate
    collateral or hybrid ARMs at December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    Vintage year refers to the year of origination and not to the
    year of purchase.

CMBS.

There have been disruptions in the CMBS
    market due to market perceptions that default rates will
    increase in part due to weakness in commercial real estate
    market fundamentals and due in part to relaxed underwriting
    standards by some originators of commercial mortgage loans
    within the more recent vintage years (i.e., 2006 and later).
    These factors have caused a pull-back in market liquidity,
    increased credit spreads and repricing of risk, which has led to
    higher levels of unrealized losses as compared to historical
    levels. However, in 2009 market conditions improved, credit
    spreads narrowed and unrealized losses decreased from 21% to 6%
    of cost or amortized cost from December 31, 2008 to
    December 31, 2009. Based upon the analysis of the
    Company’s exposure to CMBS, the Company expects to receive
    payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the
    securities that are considered temporarily impaired. Any
    securities where the present value of projected future cash
    flows expected to be collected is less than amortized cost are
    impaired in accordance with our impairment policy.

The Company’s holdings in CMBS were $15.6 billion and
    $12.6 billion, at estimated fair value at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The cost or amortized cost and
    estimated fair value, rating distribution by Moody’s,
    S&P or Fitch, and holdings by vintage year of such
    securities held by the Company at December 31, 2009 and
    2008. The Company had no exposure to CMBS index securities and
    its holdings of commercial real estate collateralized debt
    obligations securities were $111 million and
    $121 million of estimated fair value at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The weighted average credit
    enhancement of the Company’s CMBS holdings was 28% and 26%,
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. This credit
    enhancement percentage represents the current weighted average
    estimated percentage of outstanding capital structure
    subordinated to the Company’s investment holding that is
    available to absorb losses before the security incurs the first
    dollar of loss of principal. The credit protection does not
    include any equity interest or property value in excess of
    outstanding debt.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments — Fixed Maturity
    Securities

Available-for-Sale — CMBS”

for tables that present the Company’s holdings of CMBS by
    rating agency designations and by vintage year at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

ABS.

The Company’s ABS are diversified
    both by sector and by issuer. See Note 3 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements
    “Investments — Fixed Maturity Securities

Available-for-Sale

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — ABS” for a table that presents the
    Company’s ABS by collateral type, portion rated Aaa/AAA and
    portion credit enhanced held by the Company at December 31,
    2009 and 2008.

The slowing U.S. housing market, greater use of affordable
    mortgage products and relaxed underwriting standards for some
    originators of

sub-prime

loans have recently led to higher delinquency and loss rates,
    especially within the 2006 and 2007 vintage years. Vintage year
    refers to the year of origination and not to the year of
    purchase. These factors have caused a pull-back in market
    liquidity and repricing of risk, which has led to higher levels
    of unrealized losses on securities backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans as compared to historical levels. However, in
    2009, market conditions improved, credit spreads narrowed and
    unrealized losses decreased from 39% to 36% of cost or amortized
    cost from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2009.
    Based upon the analysis of the Company’s

sub-prime

mortgage loans through its exposure to ABS, the Company expects
    to receive payments in accordance with the contractual terms of
    the securities that are considered temporarily impaired. Any
    securities where the present value of projected future cash
    flows expected to be collected is less than amortized cost are
    impaired in accordance with our impairment policy.



See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments— Fixed Maturity

Available-for-Sale —

ABS” for tables that present the Company’s holdings of
    ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans by rating agency designations and by vintage year
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company had ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans with estimated fair values of $1,044 million
    and $1,142 million, respectively, and unrealized losses of
    $593 million and $730 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Approximately 63%
    of this portfolio was rated Aa or better, of which 61% was in
    vintage year 2005 and prior at December 31, 2009.
    Approximately 82% of this portfolio was rated Aa or better, of
    which 82% was in vintage year 2005 and prior at
    December 31, 2008. These older vintages benefit from better
    underwriting, improved enhancement levels and higher residential
    property price appreciation. All of the $1,044 million and
    $1,142 million of ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans were classified as Level 3 fixed maturity
    securities at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    NAIC rating distribution of the Company’s ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans at December 31, 2009 was as follows: 69%
    NAIC 1, 4% NAIC 2 and 27% NAIC 3 through 6. The NAIC rating
    distribution of the Company’s ABS supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans at December 31, 2008 was as follows: 87%
    NAIC 1, 12% NAIC 2 and 1% NAIC 3 through 6.

ABS also include collateralized debt obligations backed by

sub-prime

mortgage loans at an aggregate cost of $22 million with an
    estimated fair value of $8 million at December 31,
    2009 and an aggregate cost of $20 million with an estimated
    fair value of $10 million at December 31, 2008.

The fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss greater than $10 million, decreased
    $10.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009.
    These securities were included in the Company’s OTTI review
    process. Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of
    these securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the
    cause of the decline in, or improvement in, gross unrealized
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 being primarily
    attributable to improving market conditions, including narrowing
    of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity and the
    Company’s current intentions and assessments (as applicable
    to the type of security) about holding, selling, and any
    requirements to sell these securities, the Company has concluded
    that these securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    and severity of an unrealized loss position for equity
    securities is given greater weight and consideration than for
    fixed maturity securities. An extended and severe unrealized
    loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any
    impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled
    interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for an equity security,
    greater weight and consideration is given by the Company to a
    decline in market value and the likelihood such market value
    decline will recover.

The following table presents certain information about the
    Company’s equity securities

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process at December 31, 2009, the Company evaluated its
    holdings in non-redeemable preferred stock, particularly those
    of financial services companies. The Company considered several
    factors including whether there has been any deterioration in
    credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of
    non-redeemable preferred stock with a severe or an extended
    unrealized loss. The Company also considered whether any
    non-redeemable preferred stock with an unrealized loss,
    regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend
    payments. No such dividend payments were deferred.

With respect to common stock holdings, the Company considered
    the duration and severity of the unrealized losses for
    securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more and the
    duration of unrealized losses for securities in an unrealized
    loss position of 20% or less in an extended unrealized loss
    position (i.e., 12 months or greater).

Future

other-than-temporary

impairments will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
    issuer performance (including changes in the present value of
    future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit
    rating, changes in collateral valuation, changes in interest
    rates and changes in credit spreads. If economic fundamentals
    and any of the above factors deteriorate, additional

other-than-temporary

impairments may be incurred in upcoming quarters.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses) Including OTTI Losses Recognized in
    Earnings

As described more fully in Note 1 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, effective April 1, 2009,
    the Company adopted new guidance on the recognition and
    presentation of OTTI that amends the methodology to determine
    for fixed maturity securities whether an OTTI exists, and for
    certain fixed maturity securities, changes how OTTI losses that
    are charged to earnings are measured. There was no change in the
    methodology for identification and measurement of OTTI losses
    charged to earnings for impaired equity securities.

Proceeds from sales or disposals of fixed maturity and equity

Other OTTI losses recognized in earnings include impairments on
    equity securities, impairments on perpetual hybrid securities
    classified within fixed maturity securities where the primary
    reason for the impairment was the severity and/or the duration
    of an unrealized loss position and fixed maturity securities
    where there is an intent to sell or it is more likely than not
    that the Company will be required to sell the security before
    recovery of the decline in estimated fair value.

Overview of Fixed Maturity and Equity Security OTTI Losses
    Recognized in Earnings.

Impairments of fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $1.9 billion,
    $1.7 billion and $97 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impairments
    of fixed maturity securities were $1.5 billion,
    $1.3 billion and $78 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Impairments
    of equity securities were $400 million, $430 million
    and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.



The Company’s credit-related impairments of fixed maturity
    securities were $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and
    $58 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company’s three largest impairments totaled
    $508 million, $528 million and $19 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The Company records OTTI losses charged to earnings as
    investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed
    maturity and equity securities accordingly. The Company does not
    change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The Company sold or disposed of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss that had an estimated fair value of
    $10.2 billion, $29.9 billion and $47.1 billion
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Gross losses excluding impairments for fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $1.2 million,
    $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Explanations of changes in fixed maturity and equity securities
    impairments are as follows:

•

Year Ended December 31, 2009 compared to the Year Ended
    December 31, 2008 —

Overall OTTI losses
    recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities
    were $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. The stress
    in the global financial markets that caused a significant
    increase in impairments in 2008 as compared to 2007, continued
    into 2009. Significant impairments were incurred in several
    industry sectors in 2009, including the financial services
    industry, but to a lesser degree in the financial services
    industry sector than in 2008. In 2008 certain financial
    institutions entered bankruptcy, entered FDIC receivership or
    received significant government capital infusions causing 2008
    financial services industry impairments to be higher than in
    2009. Of the fixed maturity and equity securities impairments of
    $1,900 million in 2009, $799 million were concentrated
    in the Company’s financial services industry holdings and
    were comprised of $459 million in impairments on fixed
    maturity securities and $340 million in impairments on
    equity securities, and the $799 million included
    $623 million of perpetual hybrid securities, which were
    comprised of $313 million on securities classified as fixed
    maturity securities and $310 million on securities
    classified as non-redeemable preferred stock. Overall
    impairments in 2009 were higher due to increased fixed maturity
    security impairments across several industry sectors as
    presented in the tables below, which more than offset a
    reduction in impairments in the financial services industry
    sector. Impairments across these several industry sectors
    increased in 2009 due to increased financial restructurings,
    bankruptcy filings, ratings downgrades, collateral deterioration
    or difficult operating environments of the issuers as a result
    of the challenging economic environment. Impairments on
    perpetual hybrid securities in 2009 were a result of
    deterioration in the credit rating of the issuer to below
    investment grade and due to a severe and extended unrealized
    loss position.

•

Year Ended December 31, 2008 compared to the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007 —

Overall OTTI losses
    recognized in earnings on fixed maturity and equity securities
    were $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008
    as compared to $97 million in the prior year. The
    significant increase in impairments of fixed maturity and equity
    securities in 2008 compared to 2007 was a result of the stress
    in the global financial markets, particularly in the financial
    services industry causing an increase in financial
    restructurings, bankruptcy filings, ratings downgrades, or
    difficult underlying operating environments for the issuers, as
    well as an increase in the securities that the Company either
    lacked the intent to hold, or due to extensive credit spread
    widening, the Company was uncertain of its intent to hold
    certain fixed maturity securities for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for recovery of the market value decline. Of
    the fixed maturity and equity securities impairments of
    $1.7 billion in 2008, $1,014 million were concentrated
    in the Company’s financial services industry securities
    holdings and were comprised of $673 million in impairments
    on fixed maturity securities and $341 million in
    impairments on equity securities, and the $1,014 million
    included impairments of $154 million of perpetual hybrid
    securities, which were comprised of $64 million on
    securities classified as fixed maturity securities and
    $90 million on securities classified as non-redeemable
    preferred stock. A substantial portion of the financial services
    industry impairments were concentrated in the Company’s
    holdings in three financial institutions that in 2008 entered
    bankruptcy, entered FDIC receivership or received federal
    government capital infusions - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
    (“Lehman”), Washington Mutual, Inc. (“Washington
    Mutual”) and American International Group, Inc.
    (“AIG”). Overall, impairments



related to Lehman, Washington Mutual and AIG in 2008 were
    $606 million comprised of $489 million for fixed
    maturity securities and $117 million for equity securities.
    These three counterparties account for a substantial portion,
    $489 million, of the financial services industry fixed
    maturity security impairments of $673 million; however, at
    $117 million, they do not account for the majority of the
    financial services industry equity security impairments of
    $341 million. As a result of the Company’s equity
    securities impairment review process, which included a review of
    the duration and severity of the unrealized loss position of its
    equity securities holdings, additional OTTI charges totaling
    $313 million were recorded in 2008. These additional
    impairments were principally related to impairments on financial
    services industry preferred securities that had either been in
    an unrealized loss position for an extended duration (i.e.,
    12 months or more), or were in a severe unrealized loss
    position. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company not only
    considered the severity and duration of unrealized losses on its
    preferred securities, but placed greater weight and emphasis on
    whether there had been any credit deterioration in the issuer of
    these holdings in accordance with new guidance. As result of the
    economic environment as described above, fixed maturity and
    equity securities impairments on the Company’s financial
    services industry holdings and total impairments across all
    industries sectors were higher in 2008 than 2007, as presented
    in the tables below.

    for which a portion of the OTTI loss was recognized in other

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in a securities lending program whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities and short-term investments, are loaned to third
    parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. The
    Company generally obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102%
    of the estimated fair value of the loaned securities, which is
    obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level
    greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. In
    limited instances, during the extraordinary market events
    beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and through part of
    2009, we accepted collateral less than 102% at the inception of
    certain loans, but never less than 100%, of the estimated fair
    value of such loaned securities. These loans involved
    U.S. Government Treasury Bills which are considered to have
    limited variation in their estimated fair value during the term
    of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be
    sold or repledged by the transferee. The Company is liable to
    return to its counterparties the cash collateral under its
    control.

Elements of the securities lending program is presented in
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements under “— Investments — Securities
    Lending.”

The estimated fair value of the securities related to the cash
    collateral on open at December 31, 2009 has been reduced to
    $3,193 million from $4,986 million at
    December 31, 2008. Of the $3,193 million of estimated
    fair value of the securities related to the cash collateral on
    open at December 31, 2009, $3,012 million were
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities
    which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy
    the cash requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan,
    related to the cash collateral aged less than thirty days to
    ninety days or greater, was primarily U.S. Treasury,
    agency, and government guaranteed securities, and very liquid
    RMBS. The U.S. Treasury securities on loan are primarily
    holdings of

on-the-run

U.S. Treasury securities, the most liquid
    U.S. Treasury securities available. If these high quality
    securities that are on loan are put back to the Company, the
    proceeds from immediately selling these securities can be used
    to satisfy the related cash requirements. The reinvestment
    portfolio acquired with the cash collateral consisted
    principally of fixed maturity securities (including RMBS, ABS,
    U.S. corporate and foreign corporate securities). If the on
    loan securities or the reinvestment portfolio become less
    liquid, the Company has the liquidity resources of most of its
    general account available to meet any potential cash demands
    when securities are put back to the Company.

Security collateral on deposit from counterparties in connection
    with the securities lending transactions may not be sold or
    repledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

Invested
    Assets on Deposit, Held in Trust and Pledged as
    Collateral

The invested assets on deposit, invested assets held in trust
    and invested assets pledged as collateral at December 31,
    2009 and 2008 are presented in a table in Note 3 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    “— Investments — Invested Assets on
    Deposit, Held in Trust and Pledged as Collateral.”



See also “— Investments — Securities
    Lending” for the amount of the Company’s cash and
    invested assets received from and due back to counterparties
    pursuant to the securities lending program.

Trading
    Securities

The Company has trading securities to support investment
    strategies that involve the active and frequent purchase and
    sale of securities, the execution of short sale agreements and
    asset and liability matching strategies for certain insurance
    products. Trading securities which consisted principally of
    publicly-traded fixed maturity and equity securities, were
    $2.4 billion and $0.9 billion, or 0.7% and 0.3% of
    total cash and invested assets at estimated fair value, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 3
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    “Investments— Trading Securities” for tables
    which present information about the trading securities, related
    short sale agreement liabilities, investments pledged to secure
    short sale agreement liabilities, net investment income and

Mortgage
    Loans

The Company’s mortgage loans are principally collateralized
    by commercial, agricultural and residential properties, as well
    as automobiles. The carrying value of mortgage loans was
    $50.9 billion and $51.4 billion, or 15.1% and 15.9% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. See Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements “Investments —
    Mortgage Loans” for a table that presents the carrying
    value by type of the Company’s mortgage loans

held-for-investment

of $48.2 billion and $49.4 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, as well as the
    components of the mortgage loans

held-for-sale

of $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Commercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property
    Type.

The Company diversifies its commercial
    mortgage loans by both geographic region and property type. See
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments — Mortgage
    Loans — Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and
    Property Type” for tables that present the distribution
    across geographic regions and property types for commercial
    mortgage loans

held-for-investment

at December 31, 2009 and 2008.



Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Restructured,
    Potentially Delinquent, Delinquent or Under
    Foreclosure.

The Company monitors its mortgage
    loan investments on an ongoing basis, including reviewing loans
    that are restructured, potentially delinquent, and delinquent or
    under foreclosure. These loan classifications are consistent
    with those used in industry practice.

The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in
    which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the
    debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
    debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company defines
    potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in management’s
    opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent in the
    near term. The Company defines delinquent mortgage loans,
    consistent with industry practice, as loans in which two or more
    interest or principal payments are past due. The Company defines
    mortgage loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure
    proceedings have formally commenced.

The Company diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans

held-for-investment

by both geographic region and product type. Of the
    $12,255 million of agricultural mortgage loans outstanding
    at December 31, 2009, 54% were subject to rate resets prior
    to maturity. A substantial portion of these loans has been
    successfully renegotiated and remain outstanding to maturity.

(2)

Residential and consumer loans consist of primarily residential
    mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, and automobile
    loans

held-for-investment.

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Monitoring
    Process — Commercial and Agricultural
    Loans.

The Company reviews all commercial
    mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an
    analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll,
    lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis,



estimated valuations of the underlying collateral,

loan-to-value

ratios, debt service coverage ratios, and tenant
    creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk
    loans, which include those that are classified as restructured,
    potentially delinquent, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as
    loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring
    process for agricultural loans is generally similar, with a
    focus on higher risk loans, including reviews of the portfolio
    on a geographic and sector basis.

Loan-to-value

ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in
    the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans.

Loan-to-value

ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair
    value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio
    greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than
    the collateral value. A

loan-to-value

ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value
    over the loan amount. The debt service coverage ratio compares a
    property’s net operating income to amounts needed to
    service the principal and interest due under the loan. For
    commercial loans, at December 31, 2009, the average

loan-to-value

ratio was 68%, as compared to 58% at December 31, 2008, and
    the average debt service coverage ratio was 2.2x, as compared to
    1.8x at December 31, 2008. The values utilized in
    calculating these ratios are developed in connection with our
    review of the commercial loan portfolio, and are updated
    routinely, including a periodic quality rating process and an
    evaluation of the estimated fair value of the underlying
    collateral.

Mortgage Loan Credit Quality — Monitoring
    Process — Residential and Consumer
    Loans.

The Company has a conservative residential
    and consumer loan portfolio and does not hold any option ARMs,

sub-prime,

low teaser rate, or loans with a

loan-to-value

ratio of 100% or more. Higher risk loans include those that are
    classified as restructured, potentially delinquent, delinquent
    or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher

loan-to-value

ratios and interest-only loans. The Company’s investment in
    residential junior lien loans and residential loans with a

loan-to-value

ratio of 80% or more was $76 million at December 31,
    2009, and the majority of the higher

loan-to-value

loans have mortgage insurance coverage which reduces the

loan-to-value

ratio to less than 80%. Additionally, the Company’s
    investment in traditional residential interest-only loans was
    $323 million at December 31, 2009.

Mortgage Loans Valuation Allowances.

Recent
    economic events causing deteriorating market conditions, low
    levels of liquidity and credit spread widening have all
    adversely impacted the mortgage loan markets. As a result,
    commercial real estate and residential and consumer loan market
    fundamentals, and fundamentals in certain sectors of the
    agricultural loan market, have weakened. The Company expects
    continued pressure on these fundamentals, including but not
    limited to declining rent growth, increased vacancies, rising
    delinquencies and declining property values. These deteriorating
    factors have been considered in the Company’s ongoing,
    systematic and comprehensive review of the commercial,
    agricultural and residential and consumer mortgage loan
    portfolios, resulting in higher impairments and valuation
    allowances for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared
    to the prior periods.

The Company’s valuation allowances are established both on
    a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where
    a property specific or market specific risk has been identified
    that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools
    of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property
    specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but
    for which the Company expects to incur a loss. Accordingly, a
    valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated
    probable credit losses. The Company records valuation allowances
    and gains and losses from the sale of loans in net investment
    gains (losses).

The Company records valuation allowances for loans considered to
    be impaired when it is probable that, based upon current
    information and events, the Company will be unable to collect
    all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
    agreement. Based on the facts and circumstances of the
    individual loans being impaired, loan specific valuation
    allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the
    loan over either: (i) the present value of expected future
    cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective
    interest rate; (ii) the estimated fair value of the
    loan’s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process
    of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent; or
    (iii) the loan’s observable market price.

The Company also establishes valuation allowances for loan
    losses for pools of loans with similar characteristics, such as
    loans based on similar property types or loans with similar

loan-to-value

or similar debt service coverage ratio factors when, based on
    past experience, it is probable that a credit event has occurred
    and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.



The determination of the amount of, and additions to, valuation
    allowances is based upon the Company’s periodic evaluation
    and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with its
    loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon
    several factors, including the Company’s experience for
    loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations
    for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations
    and assessments are revised as conditions change and new
    information becomes available. We update our evaluations
    regularly, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase
    or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised, and such
    changes in the valuation allowance are also recorded in net
    investment gains (losses).

The following tables present the changes in valuation allowances
    for commercial, agricultural and residential and consumer loans

    quotations, if lower, of which $202 million and
    $188 million relate to impaired mortgage loans

held-for-investment

and $8 million and $32 million to certain mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale,

at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These impaired
    mortgage loans were recorded at estimated fair value and
    represent a nonrecurring fair value measurement. The estimated
    fair value is categorized as Level 3. Included within net
    investment gains (losses) for such impaired mortgage loans were
    net impairments of $93 million and $79 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments — Mortgage Loans”
    for certain information about impaired loans, restructured
    loans, loans 90 days past or more past due, and loans in
    foreclosure at and for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007.

Real
    Estate Holdings

The Company’s real estate holdings consist of commercial
    properties located primarily in the United States. The carrying
    value of the Company’s real estate, real estate joint
    ventures and real estate

held-for-sale

was $6.9 billion and $7.6 billion, or 2.0% and 2.4%,
    respectively, of total cash and invested assets at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments— Real Estate
    Holdings” for a table that presents the carrying value of
    the Company’s real estate holdings by type at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company diversifies its real estate holdings by both
    geographic region and property type to reduce risk of
    concentration. The Company’s real estate holdings are
    primarily located in the United States. The Company’s real
    estate holdings located in California, Florida, New York and
    Texas were 23%, 13%, 11% and 10% at December 31, 2009. See
    Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements “Investments— Real Estate
    Holdings” for a table that presents the property type
    diversification at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

There were no impairments on real estate

held-for-sale

for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Company’s carrying value of real estate

held-for-sale

at both December 31, 2009 and 2008 has been reduced by
    impairments recorded prior to 2007 of $1 million.
    Impairments of real estate and real estate joint ventures

held-for-investment

were $160 million and $20 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no
    impairments of real estate and real estate joint ventures

held-for-investment

for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company held
    $93 million in cost basis real estate joint ventures which
    were impaired based on the underlying real estate joint venture
    financial statements at December 31, 2009. These real
    estate joint ventures were recorded at estimated fair value and
    represent a non-recurring fair value measurement. The estimated
    fair value was categorized as Level 3. Impairments to
    estimated fair value for such real estate joint ventures of
    $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, were
    recognized within net investment gains (losses) and are included
    in the $160 million of impairments on real estate and real
    estate joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Other
    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that principally make private equity investments in
    companies in the United States and overseas) was
    $5.5 billion and $6.0 billion, or 1.6% and 1.9% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Included within other limited partnership
    interests were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, of investments in
    hedge funds.

The Company held $561 million and $137 million of
    impaired other limited partnership interests which are accounted
    for using the cost basis at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Impairments on cost basis limited partnership
    interests are recognized at estimated fair value determined from
    information provided in the financial statements of the
    underlying other limited partnership interests in the period in
    which the impairment is recognized. Consistent with equity
    securities, greater weight and consideration is given in the
    other limited partnership interests impairment review process,
    to the severity and duration of unrealized losses on such other
    limited partnership interests holdings. Impairments to estimated
    fair value for such other limited partnership interests of
    $354 million, $105 million and $4 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    were recognized within net investment gains (losses). These
    impairments to estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair
    value measurements that have been classified as Level 3 due
    to the limited activity and price transparency inherent in the
    market for such investments.

Other
    Invested Assets

The carrying value of other invested assets was
    $12.7 billion and $17.2 billion, or 3.8% and 5.3% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. See Note 3 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements “Investments —
    Other Invested Assets” for a table that presents the
    carrying value of the Company’s other invested assets by
    type at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and related supporting
    tables for leveraged leases and MSRs included within other
    invested assets.

Short-term
    Investments

The carrying value of short-term investments, which include
    investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but
    greater than three months, at the time of acquisition was
    $8.4 billion and $13.9 billion, or 2.5% and 4.3% of
    total cash and invested assets at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

    Statements for the information concerning variable interest
    entities.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives.

The Company is exposed to various
    risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including
    interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, and
    equity market risk. The Company uses a variety of strategies to
    manage these risks, including the use of derivative instruments.
    See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for a comprehensive description of the nature of the
    Company’s derivative instruments, including the strategies
    for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.

See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information about the notional amount, estimated
    fair value, and primary underlying risk exposure of
    Company’s derivative financial instruments, excluding
    embedded derivatives held at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Hedging.

See Note 4 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for information about:

•

The notional amount and estimated fair value of derivatives and
    non-derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments by
    type of hedge designation at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of
    significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher
    degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations
    of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although
    Level 3 inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate
    given the circumstances and are assumed to be consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments, the use of different inputs or methodologies could
    have a material effect on the estimated fair value of
    Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.

Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31,
    2009 include: interest rate forwards including interest rate
    lock commitments with certain unobservable inputs, including
    pull-through rates; equity variance swaps with unobservable
    volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker
    quotations; foreign currency swaps which are cancelable and
    priced through independent broker quotations; interest rate
    swaps with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion
    of the yield curve; credit default swaps based upon baskets of
    credits having unobservable credit correlations, as well as
    credit default swaps with maturities which extend beyond the



observable portion of the credit curves and credit default swaps
    priced through independent broker quotes; foreign currency
    forwards priced via independent broker quotations or with
    liquidity adjustments; implied volatility swaps with
    unobservable volatility inputs; equity options with unobservable
    volatility inputs; interest rate caps and floors referencing
    unobservable yield curves

and/or

which
    include liquidity and volatility adjustments; currency options
    based upon baskets of currencies having unobservable currency
    correlations; and credit forwards having unobservable repurchase
    rates.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, 5.5% and 2.7% of the net
    derivative estimated fair value was priced via independent
    broker quotations.

A rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives
    measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using
    significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs for the year

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company’s volatility
    inputs for certain of its equity options changed from being
    unobservable to observable, which resulted in the transfer of
    these positions from level 3 to level 2. The
    volatility inputs became observable because the Company began
    utilizing a market data provider that constructs an implied
    volatility surface sourced from transactions executed in the
    marketplace. The value at the beginning of the year of the
    options transferred was $2.0 billion, and the amount
    recorded in earnings in connection with these options for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 was a loss of
    $762 million.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $4.1 billion and
    $4.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts will be
    invested in partnerships over the next five years. There are no
    other obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements
    that are reasonably likely to become material.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $2.7 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company intends to sell the
    majority of these originated residential mortgage loans.
    Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans that will
    be

held-for-sale

are considered derivatives pursuant to the guidance on
    derivatives and hedging, and their estimated fair value and
    notional amounts are included within interest rate forwards.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be

held-for-investment.

The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

The purpose of the Company’s loan program is to enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. There
    are no other obligations or liabilities arising from such
    arrangements that are reasonably likely to become material.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.3 billion and
    $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. There are no other obligations or liabilities
    arising from such arrangements that are reasonably likely to
    become material.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and
    sublease agreements for office space, data processing and other
    equipment. The Company’s commitments under such lease
    agreements are included within the



contractual obligations table. See “— Liquidity
    and Capital Resources — The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Uses — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Credit
    Facilities, Committed Facilities and Letters of
    Credit

The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities
    and letters of credit with various financial institutions. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities,” for
    further descriptions of such arrangements.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as

third-party

lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time
    limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $1.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, we do not believe that it is
    possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could
    become due under these guarantees in the future. We believe that
    it is unlikely the Company will have to make any material
    payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or commitments.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    reduced $1 million of previously recorded liabilities
    related to certain investment transactions. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities were $5 million and $6 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for indemnities,
    guarantees and commitments.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in
    exchange for the referenced credit obligation. If a credit
    event, as defined by the contract, occurs the Company’s
    maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced
    credit obligations is zero, was $3.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009. However, the Company believes that any
    actual future losses will be significantly lower than this
    amount. Additionally, the Company can terminate these contracts
    at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an
    amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the
    credit default swaps. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    would have paid $37 million to terminate all of these
    contracts.

Other
    Commitments

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut is a member of the
    Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB of
    Boston”) and holds $70 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of Boston at both December 31, 2009 and 2008, which is
    included in equity securities. MICC has also entered into
    funding agreements with the FHLB of



Boston whereby MICC has issued such funding agreements in
    exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of Boston has been
    granted a blanket lien on certain MICC assets, including
    residential mortgage-backed securities, to collateralize
    MICC’s obligations under the funding agreements. MICC
    maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use,
    commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral
    as long as there is no event of default and the remaining
    qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral
    maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MICC, the FHLB
    of Boston’s recovery on the collateral is limited to the
    amount of MICC’s liability to the FHLB of Boston. The
    amount of the Company’s liability for funding agreements
    with the FHLB of Boston was $326 million and
    $526 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. In addition, at December 31, 2008, MICC had
    advances of $300 million from the FHLB of Boston with
    original maturities of less than one year and therefore, such
    advances are included in short-term debt. There were no such
    advances at December 31, 2009. These advances and the
    advances on these funding agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $419 million and $1,284 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest credited on the
    funding agreements, which are included in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, was $6 million,
    $15 million and $34 million, respectively.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a member of the FHLB of
    NY and holds $742 million and $830 million of common
    stock of the FHLB of NY at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which is included in equity securities. MLIC has
    also entered into funding agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MLIC has issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and
    for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC
    assets, including residential mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MLIC’s obligations under the funding
    agreements. MLIC maintains control over these pledged assets,
    and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of
    the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the
    remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the
    collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC,
    the FHLB of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to
    the amount of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The
    amount of the Company’s liability for funding agreements
    with the FHLB of NY was $13.7 billion and
    $15.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. The advances on these agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $15.1 billion and $17.8 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest credited on the
    funding agreements, which are included in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, was $333 million,
    $229 million and $94 million, respectively.

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds
    $124 million and $89 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also
    entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for
    cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket
    lien on certain of MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages,
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the
    repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase
    agreements and the related security agreement represented by
    this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by
    MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the
    amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding
    repurchase agreements. The amount of MetLife Bank’s
    liability for repurchase agreements entered into with the FHLB
    of NY was $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt and short-term debt depending upon the
    original tenor of the advance. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, MetLife Bank received
    advances related to long-term borrowings totaling
    $1.3 billion, $220 million and $390 million,
    respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank made repayments
    to the FHLB of NY of $497 million, $371 million and
    $175 million related to long-term borrowings for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    advances on the repurchase agreements related to both long-term
    and short-term debt were collateralized by residential
    mortgages, mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities with
    estimated fair values of $5.5 billion and $3.1 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Collateral
    for Securities Lending

The Company has non-cash collateral for securities lending on
    deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or repledged, and
    which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets.
    The amount of this collateral was $6 million and
    $279 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Insolvency
    Assessments

See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

The Company establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially
    determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy
    obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured
    dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered
    events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for
    actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For
    more details on Policyholder Liabilities see
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of
    Critical Accounting Estimates.” Also see Notes 1 and 8
    of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an
    analysis of certain policyholder liabilities at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial
    liabilities, the Company cannot precisely determine the amounts
    that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial
    liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the
    estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur
    until well into the future.

However, we believe our actuarial liabilities for future
    benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to
    be paid to policyholders. We periodically review our estimates
    of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
    with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
    permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
    expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
    development of actuarial liabilities.

The Company has experienced, and will likely in the future
    experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism,
    and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact
    on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
    Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
    pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes,
    explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing
    water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such
    as terrorist attacks. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the
    incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from
    catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of
    catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk
    from these perils.

Future
    Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an
    extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated
    as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid,
    reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying
    assumptions in accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial
    standards. Principal assumptions used in the establishment of
    liabilities for future policy benefits include mortality,
    morbidity, policy lapse, renewal, retirement, investment
    returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent events as
    appropriate to the respective product type. These assumptions
    are established at the time the policy is issued and are
    intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy
    benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities
    are established on a block of business basis. If experience is
    less favorable than assumed and future losses are projected
    under loss recognition testing, then additional liabilities may
    be required, resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and
    claims.

Insurance Products.

Future policy benefits are
    comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under
    disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for
    survivor income benefit insurance, long term care policies,
    active life policies and premium stabilization and other
    contingency liabilities held under participating life insurance
    contracts. In order to manage risk, the Company has often
    reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new



individual life insurance policies. The reinsurance programs are
    routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or
    decreases to existing coverage. The Company entered into various
    derivative positions, primarily interest rate swaps and
    swaptions, to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums
    received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of
    the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original
    pricing of these contracts.

Retirement Products.

Future policy benefits
    are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income
    annuities, supplemental contracts with and without life
    contingencies, liabilities for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits
    (“GMDBs”) included in certain annuity contracts, and a
    certain portion of guaranteed living benefits. See
    “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Corporate Benefit Funding.

Liabilities are
    primarily related to structured settlement annuities. There is
    no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. A
    sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact
    earnings as a result. The Company has various derivative
    positions, primarily interest rate floors and interest rate
    swaps, to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.

Auto & Home.

Future policy benefits
    include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for
    property and casualty insurance and represent the amount
    estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and
    claims incurred but not reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims
    are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim
    frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends,
    legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are
    based upon the Company’s historical experience and analyses
    of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss
    adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and
    consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends
    and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage
    and subrogation.

International.

Future policy benefits are held
    primarily for immediate annuities in the Latin America region,
    as well as for total return pass-thru provisions included in
    certain universal life and savings products in Latin America,
    and traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts sold in
    various countries in the Asia Pacific region. They also include
    certain liabilities for variable annuity guarantees of minimum
    death benefits, and longevity guarantees sold in the Asia
    Pacific region. Finally, in the EMEI region, they also include
    unearned premium liabilities established for credit insurance
    contracts covering death, disability and involuntary loss of
    employment, as well as a small amount of traditional life and
    endowment contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include
    sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at
    issue, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, asset
    default and more rapid improvement of mortality levels than
    anticipated for life contingent immediate annuities. The Company
    mitigates its risks by implementing an asset/liability matching
    policy and through the development of periodic experience
    studies. See “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim
    expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these
    changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of
    operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of
    prior year losses.

Banking, Corporate & Other.

Future
    policy benefits primarily include liabilities for quota-share
    reinsurance agreements for certain long-term care and
    workers’ compensation business written by MICC, a
    subsidiary of the Company, prior to the acquisition of MICC.
    These are run-off businesses that have been included within
    Banking, Corporate & Other since the acquisition of
    MICC.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

Policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account
    value, which includes accrued interest credited, but exclude the
    impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred
    upon surrender.

Insurance Products.

Policyholder account
    balances are held for death benefit disbursement retained asset
    accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable
    life insurance policies, specialized life insurance products for
    benefit programs, general account universal life policies, and
    the fixed account of variable life insurance policies.
    Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate
    set by the Company, which are influenced by current market
    rates. The majority of the policyholder account balances have a
    guaranteed minimum credited rate between 1.5% and 5.0%. A
    sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact
    earnings



as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees. The Company
    has various derivative positions, primarily interest rate
    floors, to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a
    scenario.

Retirement Products.

Policyholder account
    balances are held for fixed deferred annuities and the fixed
    account portion of variable annuities, for certain income
    annuities, and for certain portions of guaranteed benefits.
    Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate
    set by the Company, which are influenced by current market
    rates, and generally have a guaranteed minimum credited rate
    between 1.5% and 4.0%. See “— Variable Annuity
    Guarantees.”

Corporate Benefit Funding.

Policyholder
    account balances are comprised of funding agreements. Interest
    crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or
    variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied
    to an external index, most commonly

1-month

or

3-month

LIBOR. MetLife is exposed to interest rate risks, and foreign
    exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return
    of principal at the contractual maturity date. The Company may
    invest in floating rate assets, or enter into floating rate
    swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps to
    mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. The
    Company also mitigates its risks by implementing an
    asset/liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign
    currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges,
    including cross currency swaps.

International.

Policyholder account balances
    are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans
    in the Latin America region and to a lesser degree, amounts for
    separate account type funds in certain countries in the Latin
    America, Asia Pacific and EMEI regions that do not meet the
    U.S. GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included
    are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold
    in certain countries in the Asia Pacific region that generally
    are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for
    guarantees on certain variable annuities in the Asia Pacific
    region are established in accordance with derivatives and
    hedging guidance and are also included within policyholder
    account balances. These liabilities are generally impacted by
    sustained periods of low interest rates, where there are
    interest rate guarantees. The Company mitigates its risks by
    implementing an asset/liability matching policy and by hedging
    its variable annuity guarantees. See “— Variable
    Annuity Guarantees.”

Variable
    Annuity Guarantees

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a
    minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit
    base) less withdrawals. In some cases the benefit base may be
    increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or
    market value resets. These guarantees are accounted for as
    insurance liabilities or as embedded derivatives depending on
    how and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is
    accounted for as an embedded derivative if a guarantee is paid
    without requiring (i) the occurrence of specific insurable
    event or (ii) the policyholder to annuitize. Alternatively,
    a guarantee is accounted for as an insurance liability if the
    guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the occurrence of a
    specific insurable event or (ii) upon annuitization. In
    certain cases, a guarantee may have elements of both an
    insurance liability and an embedded derivative and in such cases
    the guarantee is accounted for under a split of the two models.

The net amount at risk (“NAR”) for guarantees can
    change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained
    shifts in equity market performance, increased equity
    volatility, or changes in interest rates. The NAR disclosed in
    Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements represents management’s estimate of the current
    value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all
    exercised simultaneously at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. However, there are features, such as deferral
    periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death, that
    limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near
    future. None of the GMIB guarantees are eligible for a
    guaranteed annuitization prior to 2011.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as
    embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and
    included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted
    for as embedded derivatives include GMAB, the non
    life-contingent portion of GMWB and the portion of certain GMIB
    that do not require annuitization. For more detail on the
    determination of estimated fair value, see Note 5 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Included in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 were gains (losses) of
    $1.8 billion and ($2.7) billion, respectively, in
    embedded derivatives related to the change in estimated fair
    value of the above guarantees. The carrying amount of guarantees
    accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for
    the Company’s own credit. In connection with this
    adjustment, gains (losses) of ($1.9) billion and
    $3.0 billion are included in the gains (losses) of
    $1.8 billion and ($2.7) billion in net investment
    gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

The estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded
    derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity
    volatility, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
    Additionally, because the estimated fair value for guarantees
    accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for
    the Company’s own credit, a decrease in the Company’s
    credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to
    increase. Conversely, a widening of the Company’s credit
    spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease.
    The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the
    liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility of net
    income associated with these liabilities. The derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures,
    equity options and variance swaps, and interest rate swaps. The
    change in valuation arising from the Company’s own credit
    is not hedged.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, have liabilities
    established that are included in future policy benefits.
    Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs, the
    life-contingent portion of certain GMWB, and the portion of GMIB
    that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued over
    the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future
    expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed
    minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate
    account returns. The scenarios use best estimate assumptions
    consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition
    costs. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those
    previously projected or when current estimates of future
    assessments are lower than those previously projected,
    liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge
    to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current
    estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously
    projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed
    those previously projected. At each reporting period, the
    Company updates the actual amount of business remaining
    in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the
    projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current
    period charge or increase to earnings.

Included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is a credit of $92 million and for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 is a charge of
    $498 million, related to the respective change in
    liabilities for the above guarantees.

The carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as insurance
    liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, increased
    equity volatility, or changes in interest rates. The Company
    uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to
    mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility
    of net income associated with these liabilities. Derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity futures, treasury futures
    and interest rate swaps.

Included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the
    hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were gains (losses) of
    ($114) million and $182 million, respectively, related
    to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives carried
    at estimated fair value and gains (losses) of
    ($376) million and $331 million, respectively, related
    to freestanding derivatives.

While the Company believes that the hedging strategies employed
    for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances
    and in future policy benefits, as well as other management
    actions, have mitigated the risks related to these benefits, the
    Company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event
    that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or
    unwilling to pay. Certain of the Company’s reinsurance
    agreements and derivative positions are collateralized and
    derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements,
    both of which, significantly reduces the exposure to
    counterparty risk. In addition, the Company is subject to the
    risk that hedging and other management procedures prove
    ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or
    mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces
    economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management
    techniques employed. Lastly, because the valuation of the
    guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an
    adjustment for the Company’s own credit that is not hedged,
    changes in the Company’s own credit may result in
    significant volatility in net income.



Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims, as well as claims that have been reported but
    not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on the
    Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims.
    The Company derives estimates for the development of incurred
    but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of
    historical patterns of claims and claims development for each
    line of business. The methods used to determine these estimates
    are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this
    continuous review process and differences between estimates and
    payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and
    claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed
    or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    deferred acquisition costs. Such amortization is recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Policyholder
    Dividends Payable

Policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related
    to dividends payable in the following calendar year on
    participating policies.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Overview

Beginning in September 2008, the global financial markets
    experienced unprecedented disruption, adversely affecting the
    business environment in general, as well as financial services
    companies in particular. The U.S. economy entered a
    recession in January 2008 and most economists believe this
    recession ended in the third quarter of 2009 when positive
    growth returned. Most economists now expect positive growth to
    continue through 2010. Conditions in the financial markets have
    materially improved, but financial institutions may have to pay
    higher spreads over benchmark U.S. Treasury securities than
    before the market disruption began. There is still some
    uncertainty as to whether the stressed conditions that prevailed
    during the market disruption could recur, which could affect the
    Company’s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain
    capital.

Liquidity Management.

Based upon the strength
    of its franchise, diversification of its businesses and strong
    financial fundamentals, we continue to believe that the Company
    has ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current
    market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress
    scenarios. The Company’s short-term liquidity position
    (cash, and cash equivalents and short-term investments,
    excluding cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded
    securities and cash collateral received from counterparties in
    connection with derivative instruments) was $11.7 billion
    and $26.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. This reduction in short-term liquidity reflects
    the continued improvement in market conditions during the year
    ended December 31, 2009. During 2009, the Company invested
    a portion of its short-term liquidity position in longer term,
    high quality, liquid asset types such as U.S. government
    securities and agency residential mortgage-backed securities. We
    continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans
    for the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in light of
    changing needs and opportunities.



The
    Company

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate
    adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. Liquidity needs are
    determined from a rolling

6-month

forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily. Asset mix and
    maturities are adjusted based on the forecast. Cash flow testing
    and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity,
    which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early
    contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. We believe that the
    Company has ample liquidity and capital resources to meet
    business requirements under current market conditions and
    unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios under current
    market conditions. The Company includes provisions limiting
    withdrawal rights on many of its products, including general
    account institutional pension products (generally group
    annuities, including funding agreements, and certain deposit
    fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan sponsors.
    Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making
    withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product.

In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated
    liquidity needs, the Company has various alternatives available
    depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the
    liquidity need. These options include cash flows from
    operations, the sale of liquid assets, global funding sources
    and various credit facilities.

Under certain stressful market and economic conditions,
    liquidity may deteriorate broadly which could negatively impact
    the Company. If the Company requires significant amounts of cash
    on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements, the
    Company may have difficulty selling investment assets in a
    timely manner, be forced to sell them for less than the Company
    otherwise would have been able to realize, or both. In addition,
    in the event of such forced sale, accounting rules require the
    recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized
    loss position and may require the impairment of other securities
    based upon the Company’s ability to hold such securities,
    which may negatively impact the Company’s financial
    condition. A disruption in the financial markets could limit the
    Company’s access to, or cost of, liquidity.

In extreme circumstances, all general account assets —
    other than those which may have been pledged to a specific
    purpose — within a statutory legal entity are
    available to fund obligations of the general account within that
    legal entity.

Capital

Capital reflects the financial strength of the Company and its
    ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating
    companies, borrow funds at competitive rates and raise
    additional capital to meet operating and growth needs.

While the Company raised new capital from its debt issuances
    during the difficult market conditions prevailing since the
    second half of 2008 (see “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings”), the increase in
    credit spreads experienced since then has resulted in an
    increase in the cost of such new capital. As a result of
    reductions in interest rates, the Company’s interest
    expense and dividends on floating rate securities have been
    lower; however, the increase in the Company’s credit
    spreads since the second half of 2008 has caused the
    Company’s credit facility fees to increase.

The Company manages its capital structure to maintain a level of
    capital needed for “AA” financial strength ratings.
    However, we believe that the rating agencies have recently
    heightened the level of scrutiny that they apply to life
    insurance companies and are considering several other factors,
    in addition to the level of capital, in assigning financial
    strength ratings. The rating agencies may also adjust upward the
    capital and other requirements employed in their models for
    maintenance of certain ratings levels.

Statutory Capital and Dividends.

Our insurance
    subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet
    current regulatory requirements.

RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the
    NAIC and the state insurance departments to identify companies
    that merit regulatory action. RBC is based on a formula
    calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and
    statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk
    characteristics of the



insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate
    risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The
    formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify
    possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of
    initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank
    insurers generally. These rules apply to each of the Holding
    Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries. State insurance
    laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require
    various actions by, or take various actions against, insurers
    whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain RBC
    levels. At the date of the most recent annual statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total
    adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of
    each of those RBC levels.

The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay
    to the Holding Company or other parent entities is constrained
    by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and
    provide an additional margin for risk protection and invest in
    our businesses. We proactively take actions to maintain capital
    consistent with these ratings objectives, which may include
    adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources
    from internal or external sources of capital. Certain of these
    activities may require regulatory approval.

Rating Agencies.

Rating agencies assign
    insurer financial strength ratings to the Company’s
    domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to the
    Holding Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The level and
    composition of our regulatory capital at the subsidiary level
    and equity capital of the Company are among the many factors
    considered in determining the Company’s insurer financial
    strength and credit ratings. Each agency has its own capital
    adequacy evaluation methodology, and assessments are generally
    based on a combination of factors. We believe that the rating
    agencies have recently heightened the level of scrutiny that
    they apply to insurance companies, and that they may increase
    the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, may request
    additional information from the companies that they rate, and
    may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in
    the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings
    levels.

The Company’s financial strength ratings for its domestic
    life insurance companies are “AA-/Aa3/AA-/A+” for
    S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and A.M. Best, respectively.
    The Company’s long-term senior debt credit ratings are

“A-/A3/A-/a-”

for S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and A.M. Best,
    respectively. The Company’s ratings outlooks are
    “CreditWatch negative/stable/stable/Under Review with
    negative implications” for S&P, Moody’s, Fitch,
    and A.M. Best, respectively. For further discussion, see
    “Business — Company Ratings.”

A downgrade in the credit or financial strength (i.e.,
    claims-paying) ratings of the Company or its subsidiaries would
    likely impact the cost and availability of financing for the
    Company and its subsidiaries and result in additional collateral
    requirements or other required payments under certain
    agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by
    posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the
    agreements.

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Cash Flows from Operations.

The Company’s
    principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from
    insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A
    primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is
    the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.
    See “— The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Contractual Obligations.”

Cash Flows from Investments.

The
    Company’s principal cash inflows from its investment
    activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from
    maturities, sales of invested assets and net investment income.
    The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash
    inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market
    volatility. The Company closely monitors and manages these risks
    through its credit risk management process.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities,
    excluding: (i) cash collateral received under the
    Company’s securities lending program that has been
    reinvested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    publicly-traded securities; (ii) cash collateral received
    from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments;
    (iii) cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    securities on deposit with regulatory agencies; and
    (iv) securities held in trust in support of collateral
    financing arrangements and pledged in support of debt and
    funding agreements. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company had $139.2 billion and $141.7 billion in
    liquid assets, respectively. For further discussion of



invested assets on deposit with regulatory agencies, held in
    trust in support of collateral financing arrangements and
    pledged in support of debt and funding agreements, see
    “— Investments — Invested Assets on
    Deposit, Held in Trust and Pledged as Collateral.”

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of short-term instruments, including
    repurchase agreements and commercial paper. Capital is provided
    by a variety of instruments, including medium- and long-term
    debt, junior subordinated debt securities, capital securities
    and equity securities. The diversity of the Company’s
    funding sources, including funding that may be available through
    certain economic stabilization programs established by various
    government institutions, enhances flexibility, limits dependence
    on any one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of
    funds. The Company’s global funding sources include:

•

The Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife
    Funding”) each have commercial paper programs supported by
    our $2.85 billion general corporate credit facility.
    MetLife Funding, a subsidiary of MLIC, serves as a centralized
    finance unit for the Company. Pursuant to a support agreement,
    MLIC has agreed to cause MetLife Funding to have a tangible net
    worth of at least one dollar. At both December 31, 2009 and
    2008, MetLife Funding had a tangible net worth of
    $12 million. MetLife Funding raises cash from various
    funding sources and uses the proceeds to extend loans, through
    MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to the Holding
    Company, MLIC and other affiliates. MetLife Funding manages its
    funding sources to enhance the financial flexibility and
    liquidity of MLIC and other affiliated companies. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, MetLife Funding had total
    outstanding liabilities for its commercial paper program,
    including accrued interest payable, of $319 million and
    $414 million, respectively.

•

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Commercial Paper
    Funding Facility (“CPFF”) was initiated in 2008 to
    improve liquidity in short-term funding markets by increasing
    the availability of term commercial paper funding to issuers and
    by providing greater assurance to both issuers and investors
    that firms will be able to rollover their maturing commercial
    paper. MetLife Short Term Funding LLC, the issuer of commercial
    paper under a program supported by funding agreements issued by
    MLIC and MICC, was accepted in October 2008 for the CPFF and
    could issue a maximum amount of $3.8 billion under the
    CPFF. At December 31, 2009, MetLife Short Term Funding LLC
    had no drawdown under its CPFF capacity, compared to
    $1.65 billion at December 31, 2008. MetLife Funding
    was accepted in November 2008 for the CPFF and could issue a
    maximum amount of $1.0 billion under the CPFF. No drawdown
    by MetLife Funding had taken place under this facility at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008. The CPFF program expired on
    February 1, 2010.

•

MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing
    privileges and participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York Term Auction Facility. To utilize these facilities, MetLife
    Bank has pledged qualifying loans and investment securities to
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral. At
    December 31, 2009, MetLife Bank had no liability for
    advances  from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under
    these facilities. At December 31, 2008 MetLife Bank’s
    liability for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of
    New York under these facilities was $950 million, which is
    included in short-term debt. See Note 11 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated  Financial Statements.

•

As a member of the FHLB of NY, MetLife Bank has entered into
    repurchase agreements with FHLB of NY on both short- and
    long-term bases, with a total liability for repurchase
    agreements with the FHLB of NY of $2.4 billion and
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

•

The Holding Company and MetLife Bank elected to continue to
    participate in the debt guarantee component of the FDIC’s
    Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “FDIC
    Program”). On March 26, 2009, the Holding Company
    issued $397 million of floating-rate senior notes due June
    2012 under the FDIC Program, representing all of MetLife,
    Inc.’s capacity under the FDIC Program. MetLife Bank let
    its capacity to issue up to $178 million of guaranteed debt
    under the FDIC Program expire unused when the program ended on
    October 31, 2009.

•

In addition, the Company had obligations under funding
    agreements with the FHLB of NY of $13.7 billion and
    $15.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, for MLIC and with the FHLB of Boston of
    $326 million and $526 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, for MICC. The FHLB of



Boston had also advanced $300 million to MICC at
    December 31, 2008, which was included in short-term debt.
    There were no such advances at December 31, 2009. See
    Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had outstanding
    $912 million and $2.7 billion in short-term debt,
    respectively, and $13.2 billion and $9.7 billion in
    long-term debt, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the Company had outstanding $5.3 billion and
    $5.2 billion in collateral financing arrangements,
    respectively, and $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion in
    junior subordinated debt, respectively. Short-term and long-term
    debt includes the above-mentioned MetLife Bank funding from the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the FHLB of NY, as well as
    the above-mentioned advances from the FHLB of Boston.

Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings.

In July
    2009, the Holding Company issued $500 million of junior
    subordinated debt securities with a final maturity of August
    2069. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    10.75% up to, but not including, August 1, 2039, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the debt securities are
    not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date,
    interest will accrue at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 7.548%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. In connection with the offering, the Holding Company
    incurred $5 million of issuance costs which have been
    capitalized and included in other assets. These costs are being
    amortized over the term of the securities. See Note 13 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    description of the terms of the junior subordinated debt
    securities.

In May 2009, the Holding Company issued $1,250 million of
    senior notes due June 1, 2016. The notes bear interest at a
    fixed rate of 6.75%, payable semi-annually. In connection with
    the offering, the Holding Company incurred $6 million of
    issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other
    assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the
    notes.

In March 2009, the Holding Company issued $397 million of
    senior notes due June 2012 under the FDIC Program. The notes
    bear interest at a floating rate equal to

3-month

LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus 0.32%. In connection with the
    offering, the Holding Company incurred $15 million of
    issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other
    assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the
    notes.

In February 2009, the Holding Company remarketed its existing
    $1,035 million 4.91% Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities as 7.717% senior debt securities, Series B,
    due 2019 payable semi-annually. In August 2008, the Holding
    Company remarketed its existing $1,035 million 4.82%
    Series A junior subordinated debt securities as
    6.817% senior debt securities, Series A, due 2018
    payable semi-annually. The Series A and Series B
    junior subordinated debt securities were originally issued in
    2005 in connection with the common equity units. See
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debt
    Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.”

In April 2008, MetLife Capital Trust X, a VIE consolidated
    by the Company, issued exchangeable surplus trust securities
    (the “2008 Trust Securities”) with a face amount
    of $750 million. Interest on the 2008 Trust Securities
    or debt securities is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    9.25% up to, but not including, April 8, 2038, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the 2008
    Trust Securities or debt securities are not redeemed on or
    before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an
    annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 5.540%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a description of the terms of the
    junior subordinated debt securities.

In December 2007, MetLife Capital Trust IV, a VIE
    consolidated by the Company, issued exchangeable surplus trust
    securities (the “2007 Trust Securities”) with a
    face amount of $700 million and a discount of
    $6 million. Interest on the 2007 Trust Securities or
    debt securities is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of
    7.875% up to, but not including, December 15, 2037, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the 2007
    Trust Securities or debt securities are not redeemed on or
    before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an
    annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 3.96%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for a description of the terms of the
    junior subordinated debt securities.



Collateral Financing Arrangements.

As
    described more fully in Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of Charleston’s (“MRC”)
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution that
    referenced the $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of

35-year

surplus notes issued by MRC. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus
    notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below.

Under this agreement, the Holding Company may also be required
    to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments would be
    accounted for as a receivable and included in other assets on
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and would not
    reduce the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes.
    Such payments would, however, reduce the amount of interest
    payments due from the Holding Company under the agreement. Any
    payment received from the unaffiliated financial institution
    would reduce the receivable by an amount equal to such payment
    and would also increase the amount of interest payments due from
    the Holding Company under the agreement. In addition, the
    unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge
    collateral to the Holding Company related to any increase in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. During 2008, the
    Holding Company paid an aggregate of $800 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution relating to declines in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. The Holding Company
    did not receive any payments from the unaffiliated financial
    institution during 2008. During 2009, on a net basis, the
    Holding Company received $375 million from the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to changes in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. No payments were made or received by
    the Holding Company during 2007. Since the closing of the
    collateral financing arrangement in December 2007, on a net
    basis, the Holding Company has paid $425 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution related to changes in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. In addition, at
    December 31, 2008, the Company had pledged collateral with
    an estimated fair value of $230 million to the unaffiliated
    financial institution. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    had no collateral pledged to the unaffiliated third-party in
    connection with this agreement. The Holding Company may also be
    required to make a payment to the unaffiliated financial
    institution in connection with any early termination of this
    agreement.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of South Carolina’s (“MRSC”)
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under
    which the Holding Company is entitled to the return on the
    investment portfolio held by trusts established in connection
    with this collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the
    payment of a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The collateral financing
    agreement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing. The Holding Company may also be required to make
    payments to the unaffiliated financial institution, for deposit
    into the trusts, related to any decline in the estimated fair
    value of the assets held by the trusts, as well as amounts
    outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the collateral
    financing arrangement. During 2009 and 2008, the Holding Company
    contributed $360 million and $320 million,
    respectively, as a result of declines in the estimated fair
    value of the assets in the trusts, and cumulatively, since May
    2007, the Holding Company has contributed a total of
    $680 million as a result of declines in the estimated fair
    value of the assets in the trusts, all of which was deposited
    into the trusts.

In addition, the Holding Company may be required to pledge
    collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this
    agreement. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Holding
    Company had pledged $80 million and $86 million under
    the agreement, respectively.

Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.

On
    February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series B portion of the
    junior subordinated debt securities underlying the common equity
    units. The Series B junior subordinated debt securities



were modified as permitted by their terms to be
    7.717% senior debt securities, Series B, due
    February 15, 2019. The Holding Company did not receive any
    proceeds from the remarketing. Most common equity unit holders
    chose to have their junior subordinated debt securities
    remarketed and used the remarketing proceeds to settle their
    payment obligations under the applicable stock purchase
    contract. For those common equity unit holders that elected not
    to participate in the remarketing and elected to use their own
    cash to satisfy the payment obligations under the stock purchase
    contract, the terms of the debt are the same as the remarketed
    debt. The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    occurred on February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the
    Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock to settle the stock purchase contracts.

On August 15, 2008, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series A portion of the
    junior subordinated debt securities underlying the common equity
    units. The Series A junior subordinated debt securities
    were modified as permitted by their terms to be
    6.817% senior debt securities, Series A, due
    August 15, 2018. The Holding Company did not receive any
    proceeds from the remarketing. Most common equity unit holders
    chose to have their junior subordinated debt securities
    remarketed and used the remarketing proceeds to settle their
    payment obligations under the applicable stock purchase
    contract. For those common equity unit holders that elected not
    to participate in the remarketing and elected to use their own
    cash to satisfy the payment obligations under the stock purchase
    contract, the terms of the debt are the same as the remarketed
    debt. The initial settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    occurred on August 15, 2008, providing proceeds to the
    Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 20,244,549 shares of its common stock held in
    treasury at a value of $1,064 million to settle the stock
    purchase contracts.

Other.

On March 2, 2009, the Company sold
    Cova, the parent company of Texas Life, for $130 million in
    cash consideration, excluding $1 million of transaction
    costs. The proceeds of the transaction were paid to the Holding
    Company.

Credit and Committed Facilities.

The Company
    maintains unsecured credit facilities and committed facilities,
    which aggregated $3.2 billion and $12.8 billion,
    respectively, at December 31, 2009. When drawn upon, these
    facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the
    respective agreements.

The unsecured credit facilities are used for general corporate
    purposes. At December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding
    $548 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against
    these facilities. Remaining unused commitments were
    $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009.

The committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of
    the Company’s affiliated reinsurance liabilities. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding
    $4.7 billion in letters of credit and $2.8 billion in
    aggregate drawdowns against these facilities. Remaining unused
    commitments were $5.4 billion at December 31, 2009.

See Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of these facilities.

We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties are
    unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under
    these facilities. As commitments associated with letters of
    credit and financing arrangements may expire unused, these
    amounts do not necessarily reflect the Company’s actual
    future cash funding requirements.

Covenants.

Certain of the Company’s debt
    instruments, credit facilities and committed facilities contain
    various administrative, reporting, legal and financial
    covenants. The Company believes it was in compliance with all
    covenants at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Common Stock.

During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, 861,586 shares,
    97,515,737 shares and 3,864,894 shares of common stock
    were issued from treasury stock for $46 million,
    $5,221 million and $172 million, respectively. During
    the year ended December 31, 2008, 11,250,000 shares
    were newly issued. There were no newly issued shares during 2007
    and 2009.

On October 8, 2008, the Holding Company issued
    86,250,000 shares of its common stock at a price of $26.50
    per share for gross proceeds of $2.3 billion. Of these
    shares issued, 75,000,000 shares were issued from treasury
    stock, and 11,250,000 were newly issued shares.



Preferred Stock.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Holding Company did not issue any
    preferred stock. In December 2008, the Holding Company entered
    into a replacement capital covenant (the “Replacement
    Capital Covenant”) whereby the Company agreed for the
    benefit of holders of one or more series of the Company’s
    unsecured long-term indebtedness designated from time to time by
    the Company in accordance with the terms of the Replacement
    Capital Covenant (“Covered Debt”), that the Company
    will not repay, redeem or purchase and will cause its
    subsidiaries not to repay, redeem or purchase, on or before the
    termination of the Replacement Capital Covenant on
    December 31, 2018 (or earlier termination by agreement of
    the holders of Covered Debt or when there is no longer any
    outstanding series of unsecured long-term indebtedness which
    qualifies for designation as “Covered Debt”), the
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, of
    the Company or the 6.500% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock,
    Series B, of the Company, unless such repayment, redemption
    or purchase is made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain
    replacement capital securities and pursuant to the other terms
    and conditions set forth in the Replacement Capital Covenant.

Liquidity
    and Capital Uses

Debt Repayments.

During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, MetLife Bank made
    repayments of $497 million, $371 million and
    $175 million, respectively, to the FHLB of NY related to
    long-term borrowings. During the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, MetLife Bank made repayments related to
    short-term borrowings of $26.4 billion and
    $4.6 billion, respectively, to the FHLB of NY and
    $21.2 billion and $650 million, respectively, to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, MICC made repayments of
    $300 million to the FHLB of Boston related to short-term
    borrowings.

Insurance Liabilities.

The Company’s
    principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities
    associated with its various life insurance, property and
    casualty, annuity and group pension products, operating expenses
    and income tax, as well as principal and interest on its
    outstanding debt obligations. Liabilities arising from its
    insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under
    the aforementioned products, as well as payments for policy
    surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type
    products, surrender or lapse product behavior differs somewhat
    by segment. In the Retirement Products segment, which includes
    individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the
    normal course of business. In the year ended December 31,
    2009, both fixed and variable annuities in the Retirement
    Products segment experienced positive net flows and a decline in
    lapse rates. In the CBF segment, which includes pension
    closeouts, bank owned life insurance, other fixed annuity
    contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital
    market products (including funding agreements with the FHLB of
    NY and the FHLB of Boston), most of the business has fixed
    maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With
    regard to CBF liabilities that provide customers with limited
    liquidity rights, at December 31, 2009 there were
    $1.7 billion of funding agreements and other capital market
    products that could be put back to the Company after a period of
    notice. Of these liabilities, $1.6 billion were subject to
    notice periods between 15 and 90 days. The remainder of the
    balance was subject to notice periods between 6 and
    13 months. An additional $480 million of CBF
    liabilities were subject to credit ratings downgrade triggers
    that permit early termination subject to a notice period of
    90 days. See “— The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Uses — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Future common stock dividend decisions will be determined by the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors after taking into
    consideration factors such as the Company’s current
    earnings, expected medium- and long-term earnings, financial
    condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable
    governmental regulations and policies. Furthermore, the payment
    of dividends and other distributions to the Holding Company by
    its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and
    regulations.

Under these authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its
    common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open
    market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading
    plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated
    transactions. Future common stock repurchases will be dependent
    upon several factors, including the Company’s capital
    position, its financial strength and credit ratings, general
    market conditions and the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common
    stock. The Company does not intend to make any purchases under
    the common stock repurchase program in 2010.



MetLife Bank.

At December 31, 2009, the
    Company held $2,728 million in residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

compared with $2,012 million at December 31, 2008, an
    increase of $716 million. From time to time, MetLife Bank
    has an increased cash need to fund mortgage loans that it
    generally holds for a relatively short period before selling
    them to one of the government-sponsored enterprises such as FNMA
    or FHLMC. To meet these increased funding requirements, as well
    as to increase overall liquidity, MetLife Bank takes advantage
    of collateralized borrowing opportunities with the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York and the FHLB of NY. For further detail
    on MetLife Bank’s use of these funding sources, see
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Global Funding Sources.”

Investment and Other.

Additional cash outflows
    include those related to obligations of securities lending
    activities, investments in real estate, limited partnerships and
    joint ventures, as well as litigation-related liabilities. Also,
    the Company pledges collateral to, and has collateral pledged to
    it by, counterparties under the Company’s current
    derivative transactions. With respect to derivative transactions
    with credit ratings downgrade triggers, a two-notch downgrade
    would have impacted the Company’s derivative collateral
    requirements by $146 million at December 31, 2009. In
    addition, the Company has pledged collateral and has had
    collateral pledged to it, and may be required from time to time
    to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have
    additional collateral pledged to it, in connection with
    collateral financing arrangements related to the reinsurance of
    closed block liabilities and universal life secondary guarantee
    liabilities. See “— The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Collateral Financing
    Arrangements.”

Securities Lending.

The Company participates
    in a securities lending program whereby blocks of securities,
    which are included in fixed maturity securities and short-term
    investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage
    firms and commercial banks, and the Company receives cash
    collateral from the borrower, which must be returned to the
    borrower when the loaned securities are returned to the Company.
    Under the Company’s securities lending program, the Company
    was liable for cash collateral under its control of
    $21.5 billion and $23.3 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Of these amounts, $3.3 billion
    and $5.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, were on open terms, meaning that the related
    loaned security could be returned to the Company on the next
    business day upon return of cash collateral. Of the
    $3.2 billion of estimated fair value of the securities
    related to the cash collateral on open terms at
    December 31, 2009, $3.0 billion were
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities
    which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy
    the cash requirements. See
    “— Investments — Securities
    Lending” for further information.

Other.

In September 2008, in connection with
    the split-off of RGA as described in Note 2 of the Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company received from
    MetLife stockholders 23,093,689 shares of MetLife
    Inc.’s common stock with a market value of
    $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock with a
    net book value of $1,716 million resulting in a loss on
    disposition, including transaction costs, of $458 million.

Separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above.
    Generally, the separate account owner, rather than the Company,
    bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account
    assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims
    that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully
    offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders
    whose liability is reflected with the separate account
    liabilities. Separate account liabilities are fully funded by
    cash flows from the separate account assets and are set equal to
    the estimated fair value of separate account assets.

The Company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and
    services in the normal course of business; however, these
    purchase obligations were not material to its consolidated
    results of operations or financial position at December 31,
    2009.

Additionally, the Company has agreements in place for services
    it conducts, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to
    insurance, reinsurance, loans, and capitalization. Intercompany
    transactions have appropriately been eliminated in
    consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance
    subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the
    appropriate departments of insurance as required.



Support Agreements.

The Holding Company and
    several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are
    parties to various capital support commitments, guarantees and
    contingent reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of
    the Holding Company and a corporation in which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, each
    Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to
    cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels,
    has guaranteed certain contractual obligations or has agreed to
    provide, upon the occurrence of certain contingencies,
    reinsurance for such entity’s insurance liabilities. We
    anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place
    demands upon the Company, there will be sufficient liquidity and
    capital to enable the Company to meet anticipated demands. See
    “— The Holding Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Support Agreements.”

Litigation.

Putative or certified class action
    litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments
    against the Company, in addition to those discussed elsewhere
    herein and those otherwise provided for in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of
    the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, in
    connection with its activities as an insurer, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome
    of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere
    herein in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to herein, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcome of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Consolidated Cash Flows.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities was $3.8 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 as compared to $10.7 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Accordingly, net cash
    provided by operating activities decreased by $6.9 billion
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Cash flows from operations
    represent the net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash earnings
    items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net loss
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.3 billion
    as compared to net income of $3.3 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Accordingly, the decrease in
    earnings of $5.6 billion accounted for most of the
    $6.9 billion decrease in net cash provided by operating
    activities for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared
    to the year ended December 31, 2008. Excluding the change
    in earnings, the Company’s net cash provided by operating
    activities was $6.1 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared with $7.4 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. The net cash generated from
    operating activities is used to meet the Company’s
    liquidity needs, such as debt and dividend payments, and
    provides cash available for investing activities. Cash flows
    from operations are affected by the timing of receipt of
    premiums and other revenues, as well as the payment of the
    Company’s insurance liabilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
    $0.8 billion to $10.7 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to $9.9 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007.

Net cash used in financing activities was $4.1 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to net cash
    provided by financing activities of $6.2 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. Accordingly, net cash
    provided by (used in) financing activities decreased by
    $10.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2009
    and 2008, the Company reduced securities lending activities in
    line with market conditions, which resulted in decreases in the
    cash collateral received in connection with the securities
    lending program of $1.6 billion and $20.0 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    The Company also experienced a $5.1 billion decrease in
    cash collateral received under derivatives transactions for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to an increase of
    $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    cash collateral received under derivatives transactions is
    invested in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
    Additionally, net cash flows from policyholder account balances
    decreased



by $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009
    compared to a net increase of $13.6 billion during the year
    ended December 31, 2008, primarily as a result of
    unfavorable market conditions for the issuance of funding
    agreements and funding agreement-backed notes during most of the
    period. During the year ended December 31, 2009, there was
    a net issuance of long-term and junior subordinated debt of
    $2.9 billion compared to a net issuance of
    $667 million in the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Finally, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the
    Company had a net increase in cash from the issuance of common
    stock of $1.0 billion as compared to a $2.0 billion
    net increase during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 billion
    and $3.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $2.3 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. In
    2008 the Company reduced securities lending activities in line
    with market conditions, which resulted in a decrease of
    $20.0 billion in the cash collateral received in connection
    with the securities lending program. Partially offsetting this
    decrease was a net increase of $15.8 billion in
    policyholder account balances, which primarily reflected the
    Company’s increased level of funding agreements with the
    FHLB of NY and with MetLife Short Term Funding LLC, an issuer of
    commercial paper. The Company also experienced a
    $6.9 billion increase in cash collateral received under
    derivatives transactions, primarily as a result of the
    improvement in estimated fair value of the derivatives. The cash
    collateral received under derivatives transactions is invested
    in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which
    partly explains the major increase in this category of liquid
    assets. The Company increased short-term debt by
    $2.0 billion in 2008 compared with a decrease of
    $0.8 billion in 2007, which primarily reflected new
    activity at MetLife Bank, which borrowed $1.0 billion from
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under the Term Auction
    Facility and entered into $0.7 billion of short-term
    borrowing from the FHLB of NY in order to fund residential
    mortgage origination operations acquired by the Company in 2008
    and provide a cost effective substitute for cash collateral
    received in connection with securities lending. In 2008 the net
    cash paid related to collateral financing arrangements was
    $0.5 billion resulting from payments made by the Holding
    Company to an unaffiliated financial institution in connection
    with the collateral financing arrangement associated with
    MRC’s reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, which
    compares to $4.9 billion of cash provided by collateral
    financing arrangement transactions completed in 2007, as market
    conditions in 2008 reduced the availability and attractiveness
    of such financing. In 2008, there was a net issuance of
    $0.7 billion of long-term debt and junior subordinated debt
    securities, compared to a net issuance in 2007 of
    $1.1 billion. Finally, in order to strengthen its capital
    base, in 2008 the Company reduced its level of common stock
    repurchase activity by $0.5 billion compared with 2007
    repurchasing only $1.3 billion of common stock in 2008 as
    compared to $1.8 billion in 2007, and issued
    $3.3 billion of stock compared with no issuance in 2007.
    The Company also paid dividends on the preferred stock and
    common stock of $0.7 billion, which was comparable to the
    dividends paid in 2007.

Net cash used in investing activities was $13.9 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to
    $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. The
    net cash used in investing activities in the year ended
    December 31, 2009 corresponded with a net decrease of
    $14.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents in the same
    period, reflecting the Company’s effort to redeploy the
    elevated level of cash and cash equivalents accumulated at year
    end 2008 in response to extraordinary market conditions. The net
    cash used in investing activities in the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was primarily composed of net purchases
    of $19.5 billion of fixed maturity securities, partially
    offset by a net reduction of $5.5 billion in short-term
    investments. In the comparable 2008 period, there were net sales
    of $15.4 billion of fixed maturity securities, offset by
    net purchases of $4.0 billion in mortgage loans and net
    purchases of short-term investments of $11.3 billion, while
    cash and cash equivalents increased by $13.9 billion.

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion and
    $10.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $7.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. The
    Company reduced the level of cash available for investing
    activities in 2008 in order to significantly increase cash and
    cash equivalents as a liquidity cushion in response to the
    deterioration in the financial markets in 2008. Cash and cash
    equivalents increased $13.9 billion at December 31,
    2008 compared to the prior year. The net decrease in the amount
    of cash used in investing activities was primarily reflected in
    a decrease in net purchases of fixed maturity and equity
    securities of $15.8 billion and $2.4 billion,
    respectively, as well as a decrease in the net purchases of real
    estate and real estate joint ventures of $0.5 billion, a
    decrease in other invested assets of $0.5 billion and a
    decrease of $0.5 billion in the net origination of mortgage
    loans. In addition, the 2007 period included the sale of MetLife
    Australia’s annuities and pension businesses of
    $0.7 billion. These decreases



in net cash used in investing activities were partially offset
    by an increase in cash invested in short-term investments of
    $11.3 billion due to a repositioning from other investment
    classes due to volatile market conditions, an increase in net
    purchases of other limited partnership interests of
    $0.1 billion and an increase in policy loans of
    $0.3 billion. In addition, the 2008 period includes an
    increase of $0.4 billion of cash used to purchase
    businesses and the decrease of $0.3 billion of cash held by
    a subsidiary, which was split-off from the Company.

Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and
    Financial Holding Companies.

The Holding Company
    and its insured depository institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank,
    are subject to risk-based and leverage capital guidelines issued
    by the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and
    financial holding companies. The federal banking regulatory
    agencies are required by law to take specific prompt corrective
    actions with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum
    capital standards. At their most recently filed reports with the
    federal banking regulatory agencies, the Holding Company and
    MetLife Bank met the minimum capital standards as per federal
    banking regulatory agencies with all of MetLife Bank’s
    risk-based and leverage capital ratios meeting the federal
    banking regulatory agencies “well capitalized”
    standards and all of the Holding Company’s risk-based and
    leverage capital ratios meeting the “adequately
    capitalized” standards.

Liquidity
    and Capital

Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable
    and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and
    future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of
    sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified
    mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale
    financial markets and the ability to borrow through committed
    credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active participant
    in the global financial markets through which it obtains a
    significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as
    cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of the
    Holding Company’s liquidity and capital management.
    Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs,
    prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted
    liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the
    financial markets could limit the Holding Company’s access
    to liquidity.

The Holding Company’s ability to maintain regular access to
    competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current
    high credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We
    view our capital ratios, credit quality,



stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity
    sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to
    retaining high credit ratings. See “— The
    Company — Capital — Rating Agencies.”

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity
    risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid
    asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow
    obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and
    debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the
    Holding Company’s liquidity.

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Dividends from Subsidiaries.

The Holding
    Company relies in part on dividends from its subsidiaries to
    meet its cash requirements. The Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their
    respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the
    surplus to policyholders at the immediately preceding calendar
    year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately
    preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as
    prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which
    the Company conducts business, differ in certain respects from
    accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in
    conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the
    treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required
    investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation
    assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes. Management of the
    Holding Company cannot provide assurances that the Holding
    Company’s insurance subsidiaries will have statutory
    earnings to support payment of dividends to the Holding Company
    in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay
    cash dividends and that the applicable insurance departments
    will not disapprove any dividends that such insurance
    subsidiaries must submit for approval. See Note 18 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by
    the respective insurance subsidiary without insurance regulatory
    approval and the respective dividends paid:

In the fourth quarter of 2008, MICC declared and paid an
    ordinary dividend of $500 million to the Holding Company.
    In the third quarter of 2008, MLIC used its otherwise ordinary
    dividend capacity through an in-kind dividend in conjunction
    with the RGA split-off as approved by the New York Insurance
    Commissioner.



In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, for the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, cash dividends in
    the amount of $215 million and $235 million,
    respectively, were paid to the Holding Company. For the year
    ended December 31, 2007, $190 million in dividends
    were paid to the Holding Company, of which $176 million
    were returns of capital.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities. Liquid
    assets exclude cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded
    securities. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Holding
    Company had $3.8 billion and $2.7 billion in liquid
    assets, respectively. In addition, the Holding Company has
    pledged collateral and has had collateral pledged to it, and may
    be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or
    be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to it. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Holding Company had pledged
    $289 million and $820 million, respectively, of liquid
    assets under collateral support agreements.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of short-term instruments, including
    commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of
    instruments, including medium- and long-term debt, junior
    subordinated debt securities, collateral financing arrangements,
    capital securities and stockholders’ equity. The diversity
    of the Holding Company’s funding sources enhances funding
    flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds and
    generally lowers the cost of funds. Other sources of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity include programs for short-and
    long-term borrowing, as needed.

We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital
    plans for the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in light of
    changing requirements and market conditions.

    various types of global funding sources available to the Holding

In November 2007, the Holding Company filed a shelf registration
    statement (the “2007 Registration Statement”) with the
    SEC, which was automatically effective upon filing, in
    accordance with SEC rules. SEC rules also allow for
    pay-as-you-go fees and the ability to add securities by filing
    automatically effective amendment for companies, such as the
    Holding Company, which qualify as “Well-Known Seasoned
    Issuers.” The 2007 Registration Statement registered an
    unlimited amount of debt and equity securities and supersedes
    the shelf registration statement that the Holding Company filed
    in April 2005. The terms of any offering will be established at
    the time of the offering.

Credit and Committed Facilities.

In 2007, the
    Holding Company and MetLife Funding entered into a credit
    agreement with various financial institutions. The proceeds of
    this $2.85 billion unsecured credit facility, as amended in
    2008, are available to be used for general corporate purposes,
    as

back-up

for their commercial paper programs and for the issuance of
    letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, the Holding
    Company had outstanding $548 million in letters of credit
    and no drawdowns against this facility. Remaining unused
    commitments were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2009.

The Holding Company maintains committed facilities with a
    capacity of $1.8 billion. At December 31, 2009, the
    Holding Company had outstanding $712 million in letters of
    credit and no aggregate drawdowns against these facilities.
    Remaining unused commitments were $1.1 billion at
    December 31, 2009. In addition, the Holding Company is a
    party to committed facilities of certain of its subsidiaries,
    which aggregated $11.0 billion at December 31, 2009.
    The committed facilities are used for collateral for certain of
    the Company’s affiliated reinsurance liabilities.

For more information on Credit and Committed Facilities see
    Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Covenants.

Certain of the Holding
    Company’s debt instruments, credit facilities and committed
    facilities contain various administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants. The Holding Company believes it was in
    compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Common and Preferred Stock.

For information on
    Common Stock and Preferred Stock issued by the Holding Company,
    see “— The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Common Stock” and
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Preferred Stock.”

Liquidity
    and Capital Uses

The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include
    debt service, cash dividends on common and preferred stock,
    capital contributions to subsidiaries, payment of general
    operating expenses, acquisitions and the repurchase of the
    Holding Company’s common stock.

Affiliated Capital Transactions.

During the
    years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Holding Company
    invested an aggregate of $986 million and
    $2.6 billion, respectively, in various subsidiaries.



The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. Such loans are included in loans to subsidiaries

Debt Repayments.

None of the Holding
    Company’s debt is due before December 2011, so there is no
    near-term debt refinancing risk.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company is
    party to various capital support commitments and guarantees with
    certain of its subsidiaries and a corporation in which it owns
    50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, the Holding Company
    has agreed to cause each such entity to meet specified capital
    and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations.

In December 2009, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MRV’s reinsurance of certain universal life and term life
    insurance risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause the third protected cell of MRV to
    maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200% of
    such protected cell’s authorized control level RBC, as
    defined in state insurance statutes. See “— The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Credit and Committed Facilities” and Note 11 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In October 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MRV’s reinsurance of certain universal life and term life
    insurance risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause each of the two initial protected
    cells of MRV to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or
    greater than 200% of such protected cell’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    See ‘‘— The Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Credit and Committed
    Facilities” and Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of a portion of the liabilities associated with the
    closed block, committed to the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance to make capital contributions, if necessary, to MRC so
    that MRC may at all times maintain its total adjusted capital at
    a level of not less than 200% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes as in
    effect on the date of determination or December 31, 2007,
    whichever calculation produces the greater capital requirement,
    or as otherwise required by the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance. See “— The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Debt Issuances and
    Other Borrowings” and Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to cause MRSC to maintain total adjusted capital equal to
    the greater of $250,000 or 100% of MRSC’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    See “— The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Debt Issuances and Other
    Borrowings” and Note 12 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than



150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by state
    insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet
    its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSMIC
    to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for MSMIC to
    maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as calculated in
    accordance with the Insurance Business Law of Japan, and to make
    such loans to MSMIC as may be necessary to ensure that MSMIC has
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment
    obligations as they fall due.

The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd., under a
    reinsurance agreement with MSMIC, under which Exeter reinsures
    variable annuity business written MSMIC.

Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future
    cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries
    that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory
    approval, our asset portfolio and other cash flows and
    anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will
    be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the Holding
    Company to make payments on debt, make cash dividend payments on
    its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its
    subsidiaries, pay all operating expenses and meet its cash needs.

Holding Company Cash Flows.

Net cash used in
    operating activities was $384 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $1.2 billion of net cash
    provided for the year ending December 31, 2008.
    Accordingly, net cash provided by operating activities decreased
    by $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009
    as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The net
    cash generated from operating activities is used to meet the
    Holding Company’s liquidity needs, such as debt and
    dividend payments, and provides cash available for investing
    activities. Cash flows from operations represent net earnings
    adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in operating assets
    and liabilities. The 2009 and 2008 operating activities included
    net income (loss), earnings from subsidiaries and changes in
    current assets and liabilities.

Net cash provided by operating activities, primarily the result
    of subsidiary dividends, was $1.2 billion for the years
    ending December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 billion
    and $50 million for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $2.5 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, there were net issuances of $2.1 billion of long-term
    and junior subordinated debt compared to no net issuances in the
    comparable period of the prior year. Also, in order to
    strengthen its capital base, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Holding Company did not repurchase
    any of its common stock under its common stock repurchase
    programs as compared to the Holding Company repurchasing
    $1.3 billion of its common stock in the comparable period
    of the prior year. In addition, the Holding Company issued
    $1.0 billion of common stock during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared with $3.3 billion of both
    treasury and common stock issued during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Securities lending activity during the
    year ended December 31, 2009 increased the Holding
    Company’s cash flows by $84 million compared to a
    decrease of $471 million in the comparable period of the
    prior year. Net cash received from collateral financing
    arrangements was $375 million during the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to $800 million of net cash
    paid under these agreements during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The Holding Company repaid
    $300 million of short-term debt during the year ended
    December 31, 2009, compared with net repayments of
    $10 million during the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Financing activity results relate to the Holding Company’s
    debt and equity financing activities, as well as changes due to
    the needs and obligations arising from securities lending and
    collateral financing arrangements.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $50 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $2.9 billion of net cash used for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $2.9 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year. In
    2008, net cash paid relating to collateral financing
    arrangements was $800 million resulting from payments made
    by the



Holding Company to an unaffiliated financial institution, as
    described in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, compared to zero outflows for this purpose
    in 2007. Finally, in order to strengthen its capital base, in
    2008 the Holding Company reduced its level of common stock
    repurchase activity by $500 million compared to the prior
    year and issued $3.3 billion of common stock compared with
    zero issuance in 2007.

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion and
    $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities increased by $1.0 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Net purchases of fixed maturity
    securities were $2.0 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, partially funded by net sales of
    short-term investments of $772 million. By contrast, in the
    year ended December 31, 2008, net sales of fixed maturity
    securities were $1.0 billion, and net purchases of
    short-term investments were $1.1 billion as the Holding
    Company shifted to more liquid investments. The Holding Company
    received $130 million for the sale of a subsidiary during
    the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the use of
    $202 million related to acquisitions during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The Holding Company also made capital
    contributions of $876 million to subsidiaries (including
    $360 million paid pursuant to a collateral financing
    arrangement providing statutory reserve support for MRSC
    associated with its intercompany reinsurance obligations, as
    described in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements) during the year ended December 31,
    2009, compared to $1.3 billion (including $320 million
    paid pursuant to the collateral financing arrangement related to
    MRSC) during the year ended December 31, 2008. There were
    no repayments of loans made to subsidiaries in the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to a repayment of
    $400 million received in the year ended December 31,
    2008. Investing activity results relate to the Holding
    Company’s management of its capital and the capital of its
    subsidiaries, as well as any business development opportunities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $742 million provided for the year ended December 31,
    2007. Accordingly, net cash provided by investing activities
    decreased by $1.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due
    to increases in capital contributions to subsidiaries and
    changes in short-term investments.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Risk
    Management

The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the
    market risk associated with its assets and liabilities. It has
    developed an integrated process for managing risk, which it
    conducts through its Enterprise Risk Management Department,
    Asset/Liability Management Unit, Treasury Department and
    Investment Department along with the management of the business
    segments. The Company has established and implemented



comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and
    business segment level to minimize the effects of potential
    market volatility.

The Company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate,
    equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As
    a result of that analysis, the Company has determined that the
    estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities are
    materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets.

Enterprise Risk Management.

MetLife has
    established several financial and non-financial senior
    management committees as part of its risk management process.
    These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve
    asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate
    corporate business standards.

MetLife also has a separate Enterprise Risk Management
    Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and
    reports to MetLife’s Chief Risk Officer. The Enterprise
    Risk Management Department’s primary responsibilities
    consist of:

•

implementing a Board of Directors approved corporate risk
    framework, which outlines the Company’s approach for
    managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis;

•

developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring,
    monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the
    corporate risk framework;

•

establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;

•

deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and

•

reporting on a periodic basis to the Finance and Risk Policy
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, and with
    respect to credit risk to the Investment Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Directors and various financial and
    non-financial senior management committees.

MetLife does not expect to make any material changes to its risk
    management practices in 2010.

Asset/Liability Management
    (“ALM”).

The Company actively manages
    its assets using an approach that balances quality,
    diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity,
    concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment
    process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring
    that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The asset/liability management process
    is the shared responsibility of the Financial Risk Management
    and Asset/Liability Management Unit, Enterprise Risk Management,
    the Portfolio Management Unit, and the senior members of the
    operating business segments and is governed by the ALM
    Committee. The ALM Committee’s duties include reviewing and
    approving target portfolios, establishing investment guidelines
    and limits and providing oversight of the asset/liability
    management process on a periodic basis. The directives of the
    ALM Committee are carried out and monitored through ALM Working
    Groups which are set up to manage by product type.

MetLife establishes target asset portfolios for each major
    insurance product, which represent the investment strategies
    used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels
    of risk. These strategies are monitored through regular review
    of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve
    sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration
    and credit quality by the ALM Working Groups. MetLife does not
    expect to make any material changes to its asset/liability
    management practices in 2010.

Market
    Risk Exposures

The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance
    operations and investment activities. For purposes of this
    disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of
    loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest Rates.

The Company’s exposure to
    interest rate changes results most significantly from its
    holdings of fixed maturity securities, as well as its interest
    rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities
    include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities
    issued by government agencies, corporate bonds and
    mortgage-backed securities, all of which are mainly exposed to
    changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest



rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure
    include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain
    investment type contracts, and net embedded derivatives on
    variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have
    the same type of interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term
    interest rates) as fixed maturity securities. The Company
    employs product design, pricing and asset/liability management
    strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate
    movements. Product design and pricing strategies include the use
    of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some
    products and the ability to reset credited rates for certain
    products. Asset/liability management strategies include the use
    of derivatives and duration mismatch limits. See “Risk
    Factors — Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.

The
    Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar results from its
    holdings in

non-U.S. Dollar

denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage and
    consumer loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies
    that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the
    Company’s investment portfolios are the Euro, and the
    Canadian dollar. The principal currencies that create foreign
    currency exchange risk in the Company’s liabilities are the
    British pound, the Euro and the Swiss franc. Selectively, the
    Company uses U.S. Dollar assets to support certain long
    duration foreign currency liabilities. Through its investments
    in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company was
    primarily exposed to the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the
    South Korean won, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the
    Chilean peso, the Australian dollar, the Argentine peso and the
    Hong Kong dollar. In addition to hedging with foreign currency
    swaps, forwards and options, local surplus in some countries, is
    held entirely or in part in U.S. Dollar assets which
    further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
    fluctuation risk. The Company has matched much of its foreign
    currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their
    respective foreign currency assets, thereby reducing its risk to
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation.

Equity Prices.

The Company has exposure to
    equity prices through certain liabilities that involve long-term
    guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded
    derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
    benefits, certain policyholder account balances along with
    investments in equity securities. We manage this risk on an
    integrated basis with other risks through our asset/liability
    management strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain
    variable annuity guarantee benefits. The Company also manages
    equity price risk incurred in its investment portfolio through
    the use of derivatives. Equity exposures associated with other
    limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as
    they are not considered financial instruments under generally
    accepted accounting principles.

Management
    of Market Risk Exposures

The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest
    rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk,
    including the use of derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk Management.

To manage
    interest rate risk, the Company analyzes interest rate risk
    using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow
    projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities
    and their supporting investments, including derivative
    instruments. These projections involve evaluating the potential
    gain or loss on most of the Company’s in-force business
    under various increasing and decreasing interest rate
    environments. The New York State Insurance Department
    regulations require that MetLife perform some of these analyses
    annually as part of MetLife’s review of the sufficiency of
    its regulatory reserves. For several of its legal entities, the
    Company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset
    portfolios for the purpose of asset/liability management and the
    allocation of investment income to product lines. For each
    segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP
    liabilities less the DAC asset and any non-invested assets
    allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess swept
    to the surplus segment. The operating segments may reflect
    differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any
    product market characteristic which may drive a distinct
    investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or
    credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities
    make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the
    investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of
    liabilities in those entities. The Company measures relative
    sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to
    changes in key assumptions utilizing Company models. These
    models reflect specific product characteristics and include
    assumptions based on current and anticipated experience
    regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting



rates. In addition, these models include asset cash flow
    projections reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments,
    principal payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments and
    defaults.

Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are
    also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and
    liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the
    duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all
    policyholder guarantees and to how the Company intends to set
    indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or
    dividends. Each asset portfolio has a duration target based on
    the liability duration and the investment objectives of that
    portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity
    of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement and
    non-medical health products, the Company may support such
    liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or curve
    mismatch strategies.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
    Management.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk
    is assumed primarily in three ways: investments in foreign
    subsidiaries, purchases of foreign currency denominated
    investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain
    insurance products.

•

The Company’s Treasury Department is responsible for
    managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries.
    Limits to exposures are established and monitored by the
    Treasury Department and managed by the Investment Department.

•

The Investment Department is responsible for managing the
    exposure to foreign currency investments. Exposure limits to
    unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the
    standing authorizations granted to management by the Board of
    Directors and are reported to the Board of Directors on a
    periodic basis.

•

The lines of business are responsible for establishing limits
    and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the
    sale or issuance of insurance products.

MetLife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its
    foreign currency denominated fixed income investments, its
    equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency
    exposures caused by the sale of insurance products.

Equity Price Risk Management.

Equity price
    risk incurred through the issuance of variable annuities is
    managed by the Company’s Asset/Liability Management Unit in
    partnership with the Investment Department. Equity price risk is
    also incurred through its investment in equity securities and is
    managed by its Investment Department. MetLife uses derivatives
    to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability
    guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
    benefit and equity securities. These derivatives include
    exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts
    and equity variance swaps. The Company’s derivative hedges
    performed effectively through the extreme movements in the
    equity markets during the latter part of 2008. The Company also
    employs reinsurance to manage these exposures.

Hedging Activities.

MetLife uses derivative
    contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including
    interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, and equity risk.
    Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic
    basis while considering their impact on accounting results and
    GAAP and Statutory capital. The construction of the
    Company’s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the
    type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or
    liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce
    risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. The
    Company’s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as
    follows:

•

Risks Related to Living Guarantee Benefits — The
    Company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the
    risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits.
    These hedges include equity and interest rate futures, interest
    rate swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options
    and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.

•

Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees — For certain Company
    liability contracts, the Company provides the contractholder a
    guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include
    certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. The
    Company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated
    with these liability guarantees.



•

Reinvestment Risk in Long Duration Liability
    Contracts — Derivatives are used to hedge interest
    rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts,
    such as long-term care. Hedges include zero coupon interest rate
    swaps and swaptions.

•

Foreign Currency Risk — The Company uses currency
    swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk. These hedges
    primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds, investments
    in foreign subsidiaries or equity exposures to US dollars.

•

General ALM Hedging Strategies — In the ordinary
    course of managing the Company’s asset/liability risks, the
    Company uses interest rate futures, interest rate swaps,
    interest rate caps, interest rate floors and inflation swaps.
    These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or
    inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or
    related to expected future cash flows.

Risk
    Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis

The Company measures market risk related to its market sensitive
    assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates,
    equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a
    sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential
    changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity market
    prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes
    that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates
    and prices is reasonably possible in the near-term. In
    performing the analysis summarized below, the Company used
    market rates at December 31, 2009. The sensitivity analysis
    separately calculates each of the Company’s market risk
    exposures (interest rate, equity price and foreign currency
    exchange rate) relating to its trading and non trading assets
    and liabilities. The Company modeled the impact of changes in
    market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its
    market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows:

•

the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures
    resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates;

•

the U.S. Dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the
    Company’s foreign currency exposures due to a 10% change
    (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange
    rates; and

•

the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.

The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed
    as predictive of the Company’s future financial
    performance. The Company cannot ensure that its actual losses in
    any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in
    the table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity
    analysis include:

•

the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and
    parameters established in creating the related sensitivity
    analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages;

•

the derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on reported
    earnings may be materially different from the change in market
    values;

•

the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and
    liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and

•

the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities
    remains unchanged throughout the period.

Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not as
    substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management.
    Based on its analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or
    decrease) in market rates and prices, MetLife has determined
    that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the
    estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from
    interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity
    exposures.



The table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair
    value for each market risk exposure of the Company’s market

This quantitative measure of risk has decreased by
    $642 million, or 14%, to $4,057 million at
    December 31, 2009 from $4,699 million at
    December 31, 2008. The decrease in interest rate risk
    associated with the use of derivatives decreased by
    $1,571 million. Also, a decrease in the net embedded
    derivatives within liability host contracts primarily due to
    first time inclusion of international net embedded derivatives
    of $626 million decreased risk by $778 million.
    Additionally, a change in long-term and junior subordinated debt
    due to an improvement in credit spreads and new issuance of
    debt, and an increase in the duration of the investment
    portfolio, decreased risk by $318 million and
    $193 million, respectively. This was partially offset by an
    increase in interest rates across the long end of the swaps and
    U.S. Treasury curves resulting in an increase in the
    interest rate risk of $1,668 million. The increase in the
    net base of liabilities and assets of $522 million also
    increased interest rate risk which contributed to the offset.
    The remainder of the fluctuation is attributable to numerous
    immaterial items.

    financial statement caption not necessarily those solely subject
    to foreign exchange risk.

(2)

Embedded derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheet in the same caption as the host contract.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk increased by
    $365 million, or 69%, to $891 million at
    December 31, 2009 from $526 million at
    December 31, 2008. This increase was due to an increase in
    fixed maturities of $567 million due to higher net
    exposures primarily to the Canadian dollar, the British pound
    and the Euro. Partially offsetting this change was a decrease in
    the foreign exposure related to the use of derivatives employed
    by the Company of $273 million. The remainder of the
    fluctuation is attributable to numerous immaterial items.

Embedded derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance

Equity price risk increased by $42 million to
    $218 million at December 31, 2009 from
    $176 million at December 31, 2008. This increase is
    due to an increase of risk of $219 million attributed to
    the use of derivatives employed by the Company to hedge its
    equity exposures, partially offset by an increase in equity
    securities of $119 million and an increase in net embedded
    derivatives within liability host contracts of $53 million.
    The remainder is attributable to numerous immaterial items.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index to Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Schedules. These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for the recognition and presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses for certain investments as required by
    accounting guidance adopted on April 1, 2009, changed its
    method of accounting for certain assets and liabilities to a
    fair value measurement approach as required by accounting
    guidance adopted on January 1, 2008, and changed its method
    of accounting for deferred acquisition costs and for income
    taxes as required by accounting guidance adopted on
    January 1, 2007.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report, dated February 26, 2010, expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Business,
    Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). MetLife
    is a leading provider of insurance, employee benefits and
    financial services with operations throughout the United States
    and the Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and
    India regions. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife
    offers life insurance, annuities, auto and home insurance,
    retail banking and other financial services to individuals, as
    well as group insurance and retirement & savings
    products and services to corporations and other institutions.

During 2009, MetLife combined its former institutional and
    individual businesses, as well as its auto & home
    unit, into a single U.S. Business organization.
    U.S. Business consists of Insurance Products, Retirement
    Products, Corporate Benefit Funding and Auto & Home
    segments. The Company also has an International segment. The
    segments are managed separately because they either provide
    different products and services, require different strategies or
    have different technology requirements. In addition, the Company
    reports certain of its results of operations in Banking,
    Corporate & Other, which is comprised of MetLife Bank,
    National Association (“MetLife Bank”) and other
    business activities. See Note 22 for further business
    segment information.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries,
    partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has
    control, and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for
    which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Closed block
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular
    item. See Note 10. Intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

Certain amounts in the prior year periods’ consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    2009 presentation. Such reclassifications include
    $6.9 billion reclassified from policyholder account
    balances to bank deposits in the consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2008 and $2,185 million and
    ($305) million reclassified from policyholder account
    balances to net change in bank deposits within cash flows from
    financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. See also Note 23 for reclassifications
    related to discontinued operations.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements.

A description of critical estimates is incorporated within the
    discussion of the related accounting policies which follows. In
    applying these policies, management makes subjective and complex
    judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that
    are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and
    related judgments are common in the insurance and financial
    services industries; others are specific to the Company’s
    businesses and operations. Actual results could differ from
    these estimates.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) approved

FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification

(“Codification”) as the single source
    of authoritative accounting guidance used in the preparation of
    financial statements in conformity with GAAP for all
    non-governmental entities. Codification changed the referencing
    and organization of accounting guidance without modification of
    existing GAAP. Since it did not modify existing GAAP,
    Codification did not have any impact on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of

F-9


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

operations. On the effective date of Codification, substantially
    all existing non-SEC accounting and reporting standards were
    superseded and, therefore, are no longer referenced by title in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Fair
    Value

As described below, certain assets and liabilities are measured
    at estimated fair value on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. In addition, the notes to these consolidated
    financial statements include further disclosures of estimated
    fair values. The Company defines fair value as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
    market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants on the measurement date. In many
    cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry) price will
    be the same at initial recognition. However, in certain cases,
    the transaction price may not represent fair value. The fair
    value of a liability is based on the amount that would be paid
    to transfer a liability to a third-party with the same credit
    standing. It requires that fair value be a market-based
    measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a
    hypothetical transaction at the measurement date, considered
    from the perspective of a market participant. When quoted prices
    are not used to determine fair value the Company considers three
    broad valuation techniques: (i) the market approach,
    (ii) the income approach and (iii) the cost approach.
    The Company determines the most appropriate valuation technique
    to use, given what is being measured and the availability of
    sufficient inputs. The Company prioritizes the inputs to fair
    valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable
    inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
    The Company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at
    estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on the
    priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.
    The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability’s
    classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
    lowest level of input to its valuation. The input levels are as
    follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other significant inputs that are
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data for substantially the full term of the
    assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

Prior to January 1, 2009, the measurement and disclosures
    of fair value based on exit price excluded certain items such as
    nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities initially
    measured at estimated fair value in a business combination,
    reporting units measured at estimated fair value in the first
    step of a goodwill impairment test and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets measured at estimated fair value for
    impairment assessment.

MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Investments

The accounting policies for the Company’s principal
    investments are as follows:

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

The
    Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale

and are reported at their estimated fair value.

Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are
    recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income
    (loss), net of policyholder related amounts and deferred income
    taxes. All security transactions are recorded on a trade date
    basis. Investment gains and losses on sales of securities are
    determined on a specific identification basis.

Interest income on fixed maturity securities is recorded when
    earned using an effective yield method giving effect to
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends
    on equity securities are recorded when declared. These dividends
    and interest income are recorded in net investment income.

Included within fixed maturity securities are loan-backed
    securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed
    securities. Amortization of the premium or discount from the
    purchase of these securities considers the estimated timing and
    amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment
    experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are
    recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments
    originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and
    currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for single class
    and multi-class mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are
    estimated by management using inputs obtained from third-party
    specialists, including broker-dealers, and based on
    management’s knowledge of the current market. For
    credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities and
    certain prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield is
    recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a retrospective basis.

The Company periodically evaluates fixed maturity and equity
    securities for impairment. The assessment of whether impairments
    have occurred is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of securities: (i) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and
    (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had
    declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater. An extended and severe
    unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not
    have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all
    scheduled interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for certain equity
    securities, greater weight and consideration are given by the
    Company to a decline in market value and the likelihood such
    market value decline will recover. See also Note 3.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the
    estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost;
    (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the
    issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties;
    (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry
    sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources;

F-11


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(vi) with respect to fixed maturity securities, whether the
    Company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be
    required to sell a particular security before the decline in
    estimated fair value below cost or amortized cost recovers;
    (vii) with respect to equity securities, whether the
    Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its
    estimated fair value to an amount equal to or greater than cost;
    (viii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (ix) other
    subjective factors, including concentrations and information
    obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company prospectively adopted
    new guidance on the recognition and presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairment (“OTTI”) losses as described in
    “Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements —
    Financial Instruments.” The new guidance requires that an
    OTTI be recognized in earnings for a fixed maturity security in
    an unrealized loss position when it is anticipated that the
    amortized cost will not be recovered. In such situations, the
    OTTI recognized in earnings is the entire difference between the
    fixed maturity security’s amortized cost and its estimated
    fair value only when either: (i) the Company has the intent
    to sell the fixed maturity security; or (ii) it is more
    likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the
    fixed maturity security before recovery of the decline in
    estimated fair value below amortized cost. If neither of these
    two conditions exists, the difference between the amortized cost
    basis of the fixed maturity security and the present value of
    projected future cash flows expected to be collected is
    recognized as an OTTI in earnings (“credit loss”). If
    the estimated fair value is less than the present value of
    projected future cash flows expected to be collected, this
    portion of OTTI related to other-than credit factors
    (“noncredit loss”) is recorded as other comprehensive
    income (loss). There was no change for equity securities which,
    when an OTTI has occurred, continue to be impaired for the
    entire difference between the equity security’s cost and
    its estimated fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings.

Prior to the adoption of the new OTTI guidance, the Company
    recognized in earnings an OTTI for a fixed maturity security in
    an unrealized loss position unless it could assert that it had
    both the intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity security
    for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of
    estimated fair value to the security’s amortized cost
    basis. Also, prior to the adoption of this guidance, the entire
    difference between the fixed maturity security’s amortized
    cost basis and its estimated fair value was recognized in
    earnings if it was determined to have an OTTI.

With respect to equity securities, the Company considers in its
    OTTI analysis its intent and ability to hold a particular equity
    security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount equal to or
    greater than cost. If a sale decision is made for an equity
    security and it is not expected to recover to an amount at least
    equal to cost prior to the expected time of the sale, the
    security will be deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an
    OTTI loss will be recorded in earnings. When an OTTI loss has
    occurred, the OTTI loss is the entire difference between the
    equity security’s cost and its estimated fair value with a
    corresponding charge to earnings.

With respect to perpetual hybrid securities that have attributes
    of both debt and equity, some of which are classified as fixed
    maturity securities and some of which are classified as
    non-redeemable preferred stock within equity securities, the
    Company considers in its OTTI analysis whether there has been
    any deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of
    recovery in value of the securities that are in a severe and
    extended unrealized loss position. The Company also considers
    whether any perpetual hybrid securities, with an unrealized
    loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend
    payments. When an OTTI loss has occurred, the OTTI loss is the
    entire difference between the perpetual hybrid security’s
    cost and its estimated fair value with a corresponding charge to
    earnings.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Upon adoption of the new OTTI guidance, the Company’s
    methodology and significant inputs used to determine the amount
    of the credit loss are as follows:

(i)

The Company calculates the recovery value of fixed maturity
    securities by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based
    on the present value of future cash flows expected to be
    received. The discount rate is generally the effective interest
    rate of the fixed maturity security prior to impairment.

(ii)

When determining the collectability and the period over which
    the fixed maturity security is expected to recover, the Company
    applies the same considerations utilized in its overall
    impairment evaluation process which incorporates information
    regarding the specific security, fundamentals of the industry
    and geographic area in which the security issuer operates, and
    overall macroeconomic conditions. Projected future cash flows
    are estimated using assumptions derived from management’s
    best estimates of likely scenario-based outcomes after giving
    consideration to a variety of variables that include, but are
    not limited to: general payment terms of the security; the
    likelihood that the issuer can service the scheduled interest
    and principal payments; the quality and amount of any credit
    enhancements; the security’s position within the capital
    structure of the issuer; possible corporate restructurings or
    asset sales by the issuer; and changes to the rating of the
    security or the issuer by rating agencies.

(iii)

Additional considerations are made when assessing the unique
    features that apply to certain structured securities such as
    residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”),
    commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and
    asset-backed securities (“ABS”). These additional
    factors for structured securities include, but are not limited
    to: the quality of underlying collateral; expected prepayment
    speeds; current and forecasted loss severity; consideration of
    the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular
    security; and the payment priority within the tranche structure
    of the security.

(iv)

When determining the amount of the credit loss for U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities, foreign government securities and
    state and political subdivision securities, management considers
    the estimated fair value as the recovery value when available
    information does not indicate that another value is more
    appropriate. When information is identified that indicates a
    recovery value other than estimated fair value, management
    considers in the determination of recovery value the same
    considerations utilized in its overall impairment evaluation
    process which incorporates available information and
    management’s best estimated of scenarios-based outcomes
    regarding the specific security and issuer; possible corporate
    restructurings or asset sales by the issuer; the quality and
    amount of any credit enhancements; the security’s position
    within the capital structure of the issuer; fundamentals of the
    industry and geographic area in which the security issuer
    operates, and the overall macroeconomic conditions.

The cost or amortized cost of fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for OTTI in the period in which the
    determination is made. These impairments are included within net
    investment gains (losses). The Company does not change the
    revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

In periods subsequent to the recognition of OTTI on a fixed
    maturity security, the Company accounts for the impaired
    security as if it had been purchased on the measurement date of
    the impairment. Accordingly, the discount (or reduced premium)
    based on the new cost basis is accreted into net investment
    income over the remaining term of the fixed maturity security in
    a prospective manner based on the amount and timing of estimated
    future cash flows.

The Company purchases and receives beneficial interests in
    special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio
    principally by providing equity-based returns on fixed maturity
    securities. These investments are generally made through
    structured notes and similar instruments (collectively,
    “Structured Investment Transactions”). The Company has
    not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the
    SPEs and its exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value
    of the beneficial interests in the SPEs. The Company does not
    consolidate such SPEs as it has determined it is not the primary
    beneficiary. These Structured Investment Transactions are
    included in fixed maturity

F-13


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

securities and their investment income is generally recognized
    using the retrospective interest method. Impairments of these
    investments are included in net investment gains (losses). In
    addition, the Company has invested in certain structured
    transactions that are VIEs. These structured transactions
    include reinsurance trusts, asset-backed securitizations, hybrid
    securities, joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited
    liability companies. The Company consolidates those VIEs for
    which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company
    reconsiders whether it is the primary beneficiary for
    investments designated as VIEs on a quarterly basis.

Trading Securities.

The Company’s trading
    securities portfolio, principally consisting of fixed maturity
    and equity securities, supports investment strategies that
    involve the active and frequent purchase and sale of securities
    and the execution of short sale agreements, and supports asset
    and liability matching strategies for certain insurance
    products. Trading securities which are presented separately and
    short sale agreement liabilities, which are included in other
    liabilities, are recorded at estimated fair value, with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income. Related dividends and investment income are
    also included in net investment income.

Securities Lending.

Securities loaned
    transactions, whereby blocks of securities, which are included
    in fixed maturity securities and short-term investments, are
    loaned to third parties, are treated as financing arrangements
    and the associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash
    received. The Company generally obtains collateral in an amount
    equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities
    loaned. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the
    securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral
    obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s
    securities loaned transactions are with brokerage firms and
    commercial banks. Income and expenses associated with securities
    loaned transactions are reported as investment income and
    investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.

Mortgage Loans.

Mortgage loans

held-for-investment

are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted for any
    unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or expenses, net
    of valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the
    principal amount of the loan based on the loan’s
    contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums and
    discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. Interest
    income, amortization of premiums and discounts and prepayment
    fees are reported in net investment income. Loans are considered
    to be impaired when it is probable that, based upon current
    information and events, the Company will be unable to collect
    all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
    agreement. Based on the facts and circumstances of the
    individual loans being impaired, loan specific valuation
    allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the
    loan over either: (i) the present value of expected future
    cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective
    interest rate, (ii) the estimated fair value of the
    loan’s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process
    of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent, or
    (iii) the loan’s observable market price. The Company
    also establishes allowances for loan losses for pools of loans
    with similar characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on
    similar property types, similar

loan-to-value,

or similar debt service coverage ratio factors when, based on
    past experience, it is probable that a credit event has occurred
    and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Interest
    income earned on impaired loans is accrued on the principal
    amount of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest
    rate. However, interest ceases to accrue for loans on which
    interest is generally more than 60 days past due

and/or

when
    the collection of interest is not considered probable. Cash
    receipts on such impaired loans are recorded in accordance with
    the loan agreement as a reduction of principal and/or as
    interest income. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and
    changes in valuation allowances are reported in net investment
    gains (losses).

Mortgage loans

held-for-sale

primarily include residential mortgages which are originated
    with the intent to sell and for which the fair value option was
    elected. These loans are stated at estimated fair value with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in other
    revenue. Certain other mortgage loans previously designated as

held-for-investment

have been designated as

held-for-sale

to reflect a change in the Company’s intention as it
    relates to holding such loans. At the time of transfer, such
    loans are recorded at the

F-14


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected
    disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis.
    Amortized cost is determined in the same manner as for mortgage
    loans

held-for-investment

described above. The amount by which amortized cost exceeds
    estimated fair value less expected disposition costs is
    accounted for as a valuation allowance. Changes in such
    valuation allowance are recognized in net investment gains
    (losses).

Policy Loans.

Policy loans are stated at
    unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
    recorded as earned in investment income using the contractually
    agreed upon interest rate. Generally, interest is capitalized on
    the policy’s anniversary date.

Real Estate.

Real estate

held-for-investment,

including related improvements, is stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
    (typically 20 to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.
    The Company classifies a property as

held-for-sale

if it commits to a plan to sell a property within one year and
    actively markets the property in its current condition for a
    price that is reasonable in comparison to its estimated fair
    value. The Company classifies the results of operations and the
    gain or loss on sale of a property that either has been disposed
    of or classified as

held-for-sale

as discontinued operations, if the ongoing operations of the
    property will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company and if the Company will not have any significant
    continuing involvement in the operations of the property after
    the sale. Real estate

held-for-sale

is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair
    value less expected disposition costs. Real estate is not
    depreciated while it is classified as

held-for-sale.

The Company periodically reviews its properties

held-for-investment

for impairment and tests properties for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
    of the asset may not be recoverable and the carrying value of
    the property exceeds its estimated fair value. Properties whose
    carrying values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows
    are written down to their estimated fair value, with the
    impairment loss included in net investment gains (losses).
    Impairment losses are based upon the estimated fair value of
    real estate, which is generally computed using the present value
    of expected future cash flows from the real estate discounted at
    a rate commensurate with the underlying risks. Real estate
    acquired upon foreclosure is recorded at the lower of estimated
    fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan at the
    date of foreclosure.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests.

The Company uses the equity method of
    accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests consisting of leveraged
    buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds in
    which it has more than a minor equity interest or more than a
    minor influence over the joint ventures or partnership’s
    operations, but does not have a controlling interest and is not
    the primary beneficiary. The equity method is also used for such
    investments in which the Company has significant influence or
    more than a 20% interest. For certain real estate joint ventures
    the Company records its share of earnings using a three-month
    lag methodology for all instances where the timely financial
    information is available and the contractual right exists to
    receive such financial information. The Company uses the cost
    method of accounting for investments in real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has
    a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over the
    joint ventures or the partnership’s operations. The Company
    reports the distributions from real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost
    method and equity in earnings from real estate joint ventures
    and other limited partnership interests accounted for under the
    equity method in net investment income. In addition to the
    investees performing regular evaluations for the impairment of
    underlying investments, the Company routinely evaluates its
    investments in real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships for impairments. The Company considers its cost
    method investments for OTTI when the carrying value of real
    estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests
    exceeds the net asset value (“NAV”). The Company takes
    into consideration the severity and duration of this excess when
    deciding if the cost method investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired. For equity method investees, the Company considers
    financial and other information provided by the investee, other
    known information and

F-15


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

inherent risks in the underlying investments, as well as future
    capital commitments, in determining whether an impairment has
    occurred. When an OTTI is deemed to have occurred, the Company
    records a realized capital loss within net investment gains
    (losses) to record the investment at its estimated fair value.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments
    include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
    less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition
    and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated
    fair value, or stated at estimated fair value, if available.

Other Invested Assets.

Other invested assets
    consist principally of freestanding derivatives with positive
    estimated fair values, leveraged leases, investments in
    insurance enterprise joint ventures, tax credit partnerships,
    funding agreements, mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)
    and funds withheld at interest. Freestanding derivatives with
    positive estimated fair values are described in the derivatives
    accounting policy which follows.

Leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse debt. The
    Company participates in lease transactions which are diversified
    by industry, asset type and geographic area. The Company
    recognizes income on the leveraged leases by applying the
    leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net
    investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual
    values and impairs them to expected values.

Joint venture investments represent the Company’s
    investments in entities that engage in insurance underwriting
    activities and are accounted for on the equity method.

Tax credit partnerships are established for the purpose of
    investing in low-income housing and other social causes, where
    the primary return on investment is in the form of tax credits
    and are also accounted for under the equity method or under the
    effective yield method. The Company reports the equity in
    earnings of joint venture investments and tax credit
    partnerships in net investment income.

Funding agreements represent arrangements where the Company has
    long-term interest bearing amounts on deposit with third parties
    and are generally stated at amortized cost.

MSRs are measured at estimated fair value and are either
    acquired or are generated from the sale of originated
    residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are
    retained by the Company. Changes in estimated fair value of MSRs
    are reported in other revenues in the period in which the change
    occurs.

Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by
    ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. The
    Company records a funds withheld receivable rather than the
    underlying investments. The Company recognizes interest on funds
    withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which
    may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    investment portfolio and records it in net investment income.

The Company’s investments are exposed to four primary
    sources of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity risk, and
    market valuation. The financial statement risks, stemming from
    such investment risks, are those associated with the
    determination of estimated fair values, the diminished ability
    to sell certain investments in times of strained market
    conditions, the recognition of impairments, the recognition of
    income on certain investments and the potential consolidation of
    VIEs. The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs
    relating to these financial statement risks may have a material
    effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated
    financial statements.

When available, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted prices
    in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable.
    Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company’s
    securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not
    involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include,
    but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing of the
    issuer or

F-16


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

counterparty, industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated
    duration and management’s assumptions regarding liquidity
    and estimated future cash flows. Accordingly, the estimated fair
    values are based on available market information and
    management’s judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

are determined based on observable pricing of residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted to convert
    the securities prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market
    prices are not available. When observable pricing for similar
    loans, or securities that are backed by similar loans, are not
    available, the estimated fair values of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgage loans have also been
    designated as

held-for-sale

which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated
    fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an
    individual loan basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is
    determined using independent broker quotations or, when the loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
    estimated using internal models.

The estimated fair value of MSRs is principally determined
    through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which
    utilize various assumptions as to discount rates,
    loan-prepayments and servicing costs. The use of different
    valuation assumptions and inputs, as well as assumptions
    relating to the collection of expected cash flows may have a
    material effect on the estimated fair values of MSRs.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments,
    as applicable, is described previously by investment type. The
    determination of such allowances and impairments is highly
    subjective and is based upon the Company’s periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain structured investment
    transactions, trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market
    conditions, which could result in prepayments and changes in
    amounts to be earned.

The accounting rules for the determination of when an entity is
    a VIE and when to consolidate a VIE are complex. The
    determination of the VIE’s primary beneficiary requires an
    evaluation of the contractual and implied rights and obligations
    associated with each party’s relationship with or
    involvement in the entity, an estimate of the

F-17


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

entity’s expected losses and expected residual returns and
    the allocation of such estimates to each party involved in the
    entity. The primary beneficiary is defined as the entity that
    will absorb a majority of a VIE’s expected losses, receive
    a majority of a VIE’s expected residual returns if no
    single entity absorbs a majority of expected losses, or both.

When assessing the expected losses to determine the primary
    beneficiary for structured investment products such as
    asset-backed securitizations and collateralized debt
    obligations, the Company uses historical default probabilities
    based on the credit rating of each issuer and other inputs
    including maturity dates, industry classifications and
    geographic location. Using computational algorithms, the
    analysis simulates default scenarios resulting in a range of
    expected losses and the probability associated with each
    occurrence. For other investment structures such as hybrid
    securities, joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited
    liability companies, the Company takes into consideration the
    design of the VIE and generally uses a qualitative approach to
    determine if it is the primary beneficiary. This approach
    includes an analysis of all contractual and implied rights and
    obligations held by all parties including profit and loss
    allocations, repayment or residual value guarantees, put and
    call options and other derivative instruments. If the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE can not be identified using this
    qualitative approach, the Company calculates the expected losses
    and expected residual returns of the VIE using a
    probability-weighted cash flow model. The use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of
    the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
    from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other
    financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or
    contracted in the

over-the-counter

market. The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including
    swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage risks
    relating to its ongoing business. To a lesser extent, the
    Company uses credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps,
    to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which
    are not readily available in the cash market. The Company also
    purchases certain securities, issues certain insurance policies
    and investment contracts and engages in certain reinsurance
    contracts that have embedded derivatives.

Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheets either as assets within other
    invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at
    estimated fair value as determined through the use of quoted
    market prices for exchange-traded derivatives and interest rate
    forwards to sell certain to-be-announced securities or through
    the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The Company does not offset the fair value amounts recognized
    for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the
    same master netting agreement.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its
    use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting,
    changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are
    generally reported in net investment gains (losses) except for
    those (i) in policyholder benefits and claims for economic
    hedges of variable annuity guarantees included in future policy
    benefits, (ii) in net investment income for economic hedges
    of equity method investments in joint ventures, or for all
    derivatives held in relation to the trading portfolios,
    (iii) in other revenues for derivatives held in connection
    with the Company’s mortgage banking activities and
    (iv) in other expenses for economic hedges of foreign
    currency exposure related to the Company’s international
    subsidiaries. The fluctuations in estimated fair value of
    derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting
    can result in significant volatility in net income.

    Statements — (Continued)

To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging
    relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management
    objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction,
    as well as its designation of the hedge as either (i) a
    hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or
    liability (“fair value hedge”); (ii) a hedge of a
    forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be
    received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability
    (“cash flow hedge”); or (iii) a hedge of a net
    investment in a foreign operation. In this documentation, the
    Company sets forth how the hedging instrument is expected to
    hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and sets
    forth the method that will be used to retrospectively and
    prospectively assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness
    and the method which will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A
    derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed
    as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of
    the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at
    inception and periodically throughout the life of the designated
    hedging relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and
    measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to
    interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or
    estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in
    net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting guidance continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under such accounting guidance. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact in the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported.

Under a fair value hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative, including amounts measured as
    ineffectiveness, and changes in the estimated fair value of the
    hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged, are
    reported within net investment gains (losses). The estimated
    fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any
    accruals that are separately reported in the consolidated
    statement of operations within interest income or interest
    expense to match the location of the hedged item. However,
    accruals that are not scheduled to settle until maturity are
    included in the estimated fair value of derivatives in the
    consolidated balance sheets.

Under a cash flow hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative measured as effective are reported within
    other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity and the deferred gains or losses on
    the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statement
    of operations when the Company’s earnings are affected by
    the variability in cash flows of the hedged item. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net investment gains
    (losses). The estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives
    are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported in
    the consolidated statement of operations within interest income
    or interest expense to match the location of the hedged item.
    However, accruals that are not scheduled to settle until
    maturity are included in the estimated fair value of derivatives
    in the consolidated balance sheets.

In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes
    in the estimated fair value of the hedging derivative that are
    measured as effective are reported within other comprehensive
    income (loss) consistent with the translation adjustment for the
    hedged net investment in the foreign operation. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net investment gains
    (losses).

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
    (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair
    value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative
    expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no
    longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will
    occur; or (iv) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging
    instrument.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
    that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting
    changes in the estimated fair value or cash flows of a hedged
    item, the derivative continues to be carried in

F-19


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value,
    with changes in estimated fair value recognized currently in net
    investment gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged
    recognized asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no
    longer adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to
    the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying
    value is amortized into income over the remaining life of the
    hedged item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still
    probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of
    derivatives recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
    related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the
    consolidated statement of operations when the Company’s
    earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the
    hedged item.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer
    probable that the forecasted transactions will occur on the
    anticipated date or within two months of that date, the
    derivative continues to be carried in the consolidated balance
    sheets at its estimated fair value, with changes in estimated
    fair value recognized currently in net investment gains
    (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a derivative recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss) pursuant to the discontinued
    cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction that is no longer
    probable are recognized immediately in net investment gains
    (losses).

In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
    discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair
    value in the consolidated balance sheets, with changes in its
    estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net
    investment gains (losses).

The Company is also a party to financial instruments that
    contain terms which are deemed to be embedded derivatives. The
    Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to
    determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. If the
    instrument would not be accounted for in its entirety at
    estimated fair value and it is determined that the terms of the
    embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the
    economic characteristics of the host contract, and that a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated
    from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding
    derivative. Such embedded derivatives are carried in the
    consolidated balance sheets at estimated fair value with the
    host contract and changes in their estimated fair value are
    generally reported in net investment gains (losses) except for
    those in policyholder benefits and claims related to ceded
    reinsurance of guaranteed minimum income benefits. If the
    Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded
    derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire
    contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair
    value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the
    current period in net investment gains (losses) or in
    policyholder benefits and claims. Additionally, the Company may
    elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at
    estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value
    recognized in the current period in net investment gains
    (losses) or in policyholder benefits and claims if that contract
    contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. There
    is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation may
    not be identified and reported at estimated fair value in the
    consolidated financial statements and that their related changes
    in estimated fair value could materially affect reported net
    income.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
    with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less
    at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Property,
    Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer
    Software

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are
    included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using
    the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets, as appropriate. The estimated life for company occupied
    real estate property is generally 40 years. Estimated lives
    generally range from five to ten years for leasehold
    improvements and three to seven years for all other property and
    equipment. The cost basis of the property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements was $1.9 billion and
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Accumulated

F-20


MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and
    leasehold improvements was $1,046 million and
    $926 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Related depreciation and amortization expense was
    $152 million, $150 million and $132 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated
    at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software
    costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred
    to develop internal-use computer software during the application
    development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized
    generally over a four-year period using the straight-line
    method. The cost basis of computer software was
    $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
    capitalized software was $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Related
    amortization expense was $171 million, $153 million
    and $121 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    represents the present value of future profits embedded in
    acquired insurance annuity and investment — type
    contracts. VOBA is based on actuarially determined projections,
    by each block of business, of future policy and contract
    charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account
    performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns
    and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business
    may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC and VOBA is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial statements for
    reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency and investment returns at policy issuance, or policy
    acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include provisions for
    adverse deviation and are consistent with the assumptions used
    to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities. These
    assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition
    unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed to be unrecoverable
    from future expected profits. Absent a premium deficiency,
    variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition
    is caused only by variability in premium volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency and other factor
    changes as well as policyholder dividend scales are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that
    period. When the actual

F-21


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins,
    the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re- estimated and
    adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations.
    When actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated, the
    DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current
    period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross
    margins. Each reporting period, the Company also updates the
    actual amount of business in-force, which impacts expected
    future gross margins. When expected future gross margins are
    below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross
    margins are above the previously estimated expected future gross
    margins. Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated
    gross margins for each block of business to determine the
    recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are
    below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting
    period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business
    remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits.
    When expected future gross profits are below those previously
    estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase,
    resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite
    result occurs when the expected future gross profits are above
    the previously estimated expected future gross profits. Each
    period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross profits for
    each block of business to determine the recoverability of DAC
    and VOBA balances.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the
    Company’s long-term expectation produce higher account
    balances, which increases the Company’s future fee
    expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations
    on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in
    higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs
    when returns are lower than the Company’s long-term
    expectation. The Company’s practice to determine the impact
    of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts
    assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not
    changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed
    when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company
    monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its
    long-term expectation changes.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Periodically, the Company modifies product benefits, features,
    rights or coverages that occur by the exchange of a contract for
    a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or rider to a
    contract, or by election or coverage within a contract. If such
    modification, referred to as an internal replacement,
    substantially changes the contract, the associated DAC is
    written off immediately through income and any new deferrable
    costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred. If
    the modification does not substantially change the contract, the
    DAC amortization on the original contract will continue and any
    acquisition costs associated with the related modification are
    expensed.

Sales
    Inducements

The Company has two different types of sales inducements which
    are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives
    a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance
    is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the
    customer’s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives
    a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than
    would have been received based on the normal general account
    interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and
    amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same
    methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. The
    amortization of sales inducements is included in policyholder
    benefits and claims. Each year the Company reviews the deferred
    sales inducements to determine the recoverability of these
    balances.

Value of
    Distribution Agreements and Customer Relationships
    Acquired

Value of distribution agreements (“VODA”) is reported
    in other assets and represents the present value of future
    profits associated with the expected future business derived
    from the distribution agreements. Value of customer
    relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) is also reported in
    other assets and represents the present value of the expected
    future profits associated with the expected future business
    acquired through existing customers of the acquired company or
    business. The VODA and VOCRA associated with past acquisitions
    are amortized over useful life ranging from 10 to 30 years
    and such amortization is included in other expenses. Each year
    the Company reviews VODA and VOCRA to determine the
    recoverability of these balances.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill
    impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based
    upon data as of the close of the second quarter.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, a significant portion of goodwill
    within Banking, Corporate & Other is allocated to
    reporting units within the Company’s business segments.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value,
    there might be an indication of impairment. In such instances,
    the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a
    business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of
    goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized
    as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.

In performing its goodwill impairment tests, when we believe
    meaningful comparable market data are available, the estimated
    fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market
    multiple approach. When relevant comparables are not available,
    the Company uses a discounted cash flow model. For reporting
    units which

F-23


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

are particularly sensitive to market assumptions, such as the
    retirement products and individual life reporting units, the
    Company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using
    additional valuation methodologies.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value include projected earnings,
    current book value (with and without accumulated other
    comprehensive income), the level of economic capital required to
    support the mix of business, long term growth rates, comparative
    market multiples, the account value of in-force business,
    projections of new and renewal business, as well as margins on
    such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity market levels and the discount rate we believe
    appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of the retirement products and
    individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to
    the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, we also consider the
    Company’s market capitalization in relation to its book
    value.

We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated
    fair value of the Company’s reporting units and when
    assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the
    estimated fair value of its reporting units and their book
    value. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key
    judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change.
    Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent
    only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future
    developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions
    upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood,
    differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in
    the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units
    could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which
    could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations or financial position.

During our 2009 impairment tests of goodwill, we concluded that
    the fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their
    carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.
    However, we continue to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Deteriorating or adverse market conditions for certain
    reporting units may have a significant impact on the estimated
    fair value of these reporting units and could result in future
    impairments of goodwill.

See Note 7 for further consideration of goodwill impairment
    testing during 2009.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder Account
    Balances

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. Utilizing
    these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of
    business basis.

Future policy benefit liabilities for participating traditional
    life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of
    (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment
    policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture
    interest rate, ranging from 3% to 7% for domestic business and
    3% to 12% for international business, and mortality rates
    guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in
    such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal
    dividends.

Future policy benefits for non-participating traditional life
    insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of the present
    value of expected future benefit payments and related expenses
    less the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Assumptions as to mortality and persistency are based upon the
    Company’s experience when the basis of

F-24


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the liability is established. Interest rate assumptions for the
    aggregate future policy benefit liabilities range from 2% to 8%
    for domestic business and 2% to 12% for international business.

Participating business represented approximately 6% and 8% of
    the Company’s life insurance in-force, and 13% and 14% of
    the number of life insurance policies in-force, at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Participating
    policies represented approximately 28% and 28%, 27% and 27%, and
    31% and 30% of gross and net life insurance premiums for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Future policy benefit liabilities for individual and group
    traditional fixed annuities after annuitization are equal to the
    present value of expected future payments. Interest rate
    assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 2%
    to 11% for domestic business and 4% to 18% for international
    business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-medical health
    insurance are calculated using the net level premium method and
    assumptions as to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest,
    which provide a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rate
    assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 4%
    to 7% for domestic business and 2% to 9% for international
    business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest. Interest rate assumptions used in establishing such
    liabilities range from 3% to 8% for domestic business and 2% to
    9% for international business.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon
    the Company’s historical experience and other actuarial
    assumptions that consider the effects of current developments,
    anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in
    such estimated liabilities are included in the results of
    operations in the period in which the changes occur.

The Company establishes future policy benefit liabilities for
    minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain
    annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of death
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly
    evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability
    balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if
    actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier
    assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used in
    estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those used
    for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability
    and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and
    volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
    Index. The benefit assumptions used in calculating the
    liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a
    range of scenarios.

•

Guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of the income
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any
    future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and
    adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge
    or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
    evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The assumptions used for estimating the GMIB liabilities are
    consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities.
    In addition, the calculation of guaranteed annuitization benefit
    liabilities incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the
    potential annuitizations that may be elected by the
    contractholder. Certain GMIBs have settlement features that
    result in a portion of that guarantee being accounted for as an
    embedded derivative and are recorded in policyholder account
    balances as described below.

Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees
    and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit
    to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence
    suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The
    assumptions used in estimating the secondary and

paid-up

guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for
    amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and
    risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility
    for variable products are consistent with historical S&P
    experience. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are
    based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.

The Company establishes policyholder account balances for
    guaranteed minimum benefits relating to certain variable annuity
    products as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWB”)
    guarantee the contractholder a return of their purchase payment
    via partial withdrawals, even if the account value is reduced to
    zero, provided that the contractholder’s cumulative
    withdrawals in a contract year do not exceed a certain limit.
    The initial guaranteed withdrawal amount is equal to the initial
    benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the initial
    purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMWB is an
    embedded derivative, which is measured at estimated fair value
    separately from the host variable annuity product.

•

Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMAB”) and
    settlement features in certain GMIB described above provide the
    contractholder, after a specified period of time determined at
    the time of issuance of the variable annuity contract, with a
    minimum accumulation of their purchase payments even if the
    account value is reduced to zero. The initial guaranteed
    accumulation amount is equal to the initial benefit base as
    defined in the contract (typically, the initial purchase
    payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMAB is an embedded
    derivative, which is measured at estimated fair value separately
    from the host variable annuity product.

For GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB, the initial benefit base is
    increased by additional purchase payments made within a certain
    time period and decreases by benefits paid

and/or

withdrawal amounts. After a specified period of time, the
    benefit base may also increase as a result of an optional reset
    as defined in the contract.

GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB are accounted for as embedded
    derivatives with changes in estimated fair value reported in net
    investment gains (losses).

At inception of the GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB contracts, the
    Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of the
    projected future guarantee fees to be collected from the
    policyholder equal to the present value of projected future
    guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent
    “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The fair values for these embedded derivatives are then
    estimated based on the present value of projected future
    benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The
    projections of future benefits and future fees require capital
    market and actuarial assumptions including expectations
    concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the
    guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. Beginning in 2008, the
    valuation of these embedded derivatives includes an adjustment
    for the Company’s own credit and risk margins for
    non-capital market inputs. The Company’s own credit
    adjustment is determined taking into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt, as
    well as its claims paying ability. Risk margins are established
    to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which
    represent the additional compensation a market participant would
    require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such
    actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency,
    partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk
    margins requires the use of significant management judgment.

These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the
    Company’s own credit standing; and variations in actuarial
    assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees,
    and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in
    variances in profit and could result in losses. The effects of
    changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the
    results of operations in the period in which the changes occur.

Policyholder account balances relate to investment-type
    contracts, universal life-type policies and certain guaranteed
    minimum benefits. Investment-type contracts principally include
    traditional individual fixed annuities in the accumulation phase
    and, non-variable group annuity contracts. Policyholder account
    balances for these contracts are equal to (i) policy
    account values, which consist of an accumulation of gross
    premium payments and investment performance; (ii) credited
    interest, ranging from 1% to 17% for domestic business and 1% to
    26% for international business, less expenses, mortality charges
    and withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating
    to business combinations.

Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid and policyholder dividends
    left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims, as well as claims which have been reported
    but not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on
    the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all
    claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of
    incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development
    for each line of business. The methods used to determine these
    estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from
    this continuous review process and differences between estimates
    and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits
    and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are
    changed or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    DAC. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its
    individual life, group life and health contracts as premium
    received in advance and applies the cash received to premiums
    when due.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Recognition
    of Insurance Revenue and Related Benefits

Premiums related to traditional life and annuity policies with
    life contingencies are recognized as revenues when due from
    policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided
    against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated
    lives of the policies. When premiums are due over a
    significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits
    are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into
    operations in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or,
    for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit
    payments.

F-27


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Premiums related to non-medical health and disability contracts
    are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract
    term.

Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type
    products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues
    from such contracts consist of amounts assessed against
    policyholder account balances for mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges and are recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the
    period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged
    to operations include interest credited and benefit claims
    incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.

Premiums related to property and casualty contracts are
    recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of
    premium written relating to the unexpired coverage, are included
    in future policy benefits.

Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are
    presented net of reinsurance.

The portion of fees allocated to embedded derivatives described
    previously is recognized within net investment gains (losses) as
    part of the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives.

Other
    Revenues

Other revenues include, in addition to items described elsewhere
    herein, advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions and fees and
    administrative service fees. Such fees and commissions are
    recognized in the period in which services are performed. Other
    revenues also include changes in account value relating to
    corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”). Under certain
    COLI contracts, if the Company reports certain unlikely adverse
    results in its consolidated financial statements, withdrawals
    would not be immediately available and would be subject to
    market value adjustment, which could result in a reduction of
    the account value.

Policyholder
    Dividends

Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance
    subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of
    policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality,
    morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as
    management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of
    statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.

Income
    Taxes

The Holding Company and its includable life insurance and
    non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”). Non-includable subsidiaries file either
    separate individual corporate tax returns or separate
    consolidated tax returns.

The Company’s accounting for income taxes represents
    management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not
    be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining
    whether valuation

F-28


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

allowances should be established, as well as the amount of such
    allowances. When making such determination, consideration is
    given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities (See also Note 15) or
    when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on
    deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new
    information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation
    allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax
    laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or
    regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income
    tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could
    significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements in the year these changes occur.

The Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit
    can be recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is
    measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement.
    Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties that do not
    meet the threshold are included within other liabilities and are
    charged to earnings in the period that such determination is
    made.

The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense
    and penalties recognized as a component of income tax.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties.

For each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines
    if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or
    liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with
    applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all
    contractual features, particularly those that may limit the
    amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or
    features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.

For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration
    contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the
    difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the
    liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts
    is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of
    the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is
    recorded as an adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component
    of other expenses on a basis consistent with the way the
    acquisition costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be
    recognized. Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the
    reinsurance of in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid
    (received) related to new business, are recorded as ceded
    (assumed) premiums and ceded (assumed) future policy benefit
    liabilities are established.

For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that
    meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid
    (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) unearned premiums and are reflected as a component of
    premiums and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such
    amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining
    contract period in proportion to the amount of protection
    provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration
    contracts that meet the criteria of reinsurance accounting,
    amounts paid (received) in excess of (which do not exceed) the
    related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized
    immediately as a loss. Any gains on such retroactive agreements
    are deferred and recorded in other liabilities. The gains are
    amortized primarily using the recovery method.

F-29


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The assumptions used to account for both long and short-duration
    reinsurance agreements are consistent with those used for the
    underlying contracts. Ceded policyholder and contract related
    liabilities, other than those currently due, are reported gross
    on the balance sheet.

Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance agreements are
    included in premiums and other receivables and amounts currently
    payable are included in other liabilities. Such assets and
    liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements with the same
    reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right
    of offset exists within the reinsurance agreement. In the event
    that reinsurers do not meet their obligations to the Company
    under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, reinsurance
    balances recoverable could become uncollectible. In such
    instances, reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of
    allowances for uncollectible reinsurance.

Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include
    amounts assumed under reinsurance agreements and are net of
    reinsurance ceded. Amounts received from reinsurers for policy
    administration are reported in other revenues.

If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not
    expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits
    received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are
    included within other assets. As amounts are paid or received,
    consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or
    liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded
    as other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate.
    Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected
    payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or
    liability through other revenues or other expenses, as
    appropriate.

Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions
    and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of
    the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty
    credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and
    anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned
    assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to
    ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial
    strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using
    criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment
    process discussed previously.

Cessions under reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the
    Company’s obligations as the primary insurer.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees
    and sales representatives. A December 31 measurement date is
    used for all of the Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans.

Pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional
    formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula
    provides benefits based upon years of credited service and
    either final average or career average earnings. The cash
    balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which
    credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of
    eligible pay, as well as earnings credits, determined annually
    based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2008, virtually all the obligations are
    calculated using the traditional formula.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

The projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit
    pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial
    assumptions, from which actual results may vary, as described
    below.

The expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) represents the actuarial present value of all
    other postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligations (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future other
    postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered
    through a particular date and is the valuation basis upon which
    liabilities are established. The APBO is determined using a
    variety of actuarial assumptions, from which actual results may
    vary, as described below.

The Company recognizes the funded status of the PBO for pension
    plans and the APBO for other postretirement plans for each of
    its plans in the consolidated balance sheets. The actuarial
    gains or losses, prior service costs and credits and the
    remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not yet
    been included in net periodic benefit costs are charged, net of
    income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income.

Net periodic benefit cost is determined using management
    estimates and actuarial assumptions to derive service cost,
    interest cost, and expected return on plan assets for a
    particular year. Net periodic benefit cost also includes the
    applicable amortization of any prior service cost (credit)
    arising from the increase (decrease) in prior years’
    benefit costs due to plan amendments or initiation of new plans.
    These costs are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over
    the expected service years of employees whose benefits are
    affected by such plan amendments. Actual experience related to
    plan assets

and/or

the
    benefit obligations may differ from that originally assumed when
    determining net periodic benefit cost for a particular period,
    resulting in gains or losses. To the extent such aggregate gains
    or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
    obligations or the market-related asset value of the plans, they
    are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the expected
    service years of employees expected to receive benefits under
    the plans.

The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

The Subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution savings and
    investment plans (“SIP”) for substantially all
    employees under which a portion of employee contributions is
    matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll
    period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    for current matching contributions. As all contributions are
    transferred currently as earned to the SIP trust, no liability
    for matching contributions is recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

As more fully described in Note 18, the Company grants
    certain employees and directors stock-based compensation awards
    under various plans that are subject to specific vesting
    conditions. The cost of all stock-based transactions is measured
    at fair value at grant date and recognized over the period
    during which a grantee is required

F-31


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

to provide goods or services in exchange for the award. Although
    the terms of the Company’s stock-based plans do not
    accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the attainment of
    retirement eligibility, the requisite service period subsequent
    to attaining such eligibility is considered nonsubstantive.
    Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense related
    to stock-based awards over the shorter of the requisite service
    period or the period to attainment of retirement eligibility. An
    estimation of future forfeitures of stock-based awards is
    incorporated into the determination of compensation expense when
    recognizing expense over the requisite service period.

Foreign
    Currency

Balance sheet accounts of foreign operations are translated at
    the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and income and
    expense accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange
    prevailing during the year. The local currencies of foreign
    operations generally are the functional currencies unless the
    local economy is highly inflationary. Translation adjustments
    are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income
    or loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
    reported as net investment gains (losses) in the period in which
    they occur.

Discontinued
    Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company that
    either has been disposed of or is classified as

held-for-sale

are reported in discontinued operations if the operations and
    cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from
    the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the Company will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period. The difference between the number of shares assumed
    issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the
    dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common share include the
    dilutive effect of the assumed: (i) exercise or issuance of
    stock-based awards using the treasury stock method;
    (ii) settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying
    common equity units using the treasury stock method; and
    (iii) settlement of accelerated common stock repurchase
    contracts. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance
    of stock-based awards and settlement of the stock purchase
    contracts underlying common equity units is assumed to occur
    with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average
    market price for the period. See Notes 14, 18 and 20.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews
    relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation,
    regulatory investigations and litigation-related contingencies
    to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of
    the Company’s litigation and regulatory investigations, or
    the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts
    recorded, could have a material effect upon the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance
    laws and are generally not chargeable with liabilities that
    arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account
    assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent
    the value of such assets exceeds the separate account
    liabilities. Assets within the Company’s separate accounts
    primarily include: mutual funds, fixed maturity and equity
    securities, mortgage

    Statements — (Continued)

loans, derivatives, hedge funds, other limited partnership
    interests, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.
    The Company reports separately, as assets and liabilities,
    investments held in separate accounts and liabilities of the
    separate accounts if (i) such separate accounts are legally
    recognized; (ii) assets supporting the contract liabilities
    are legally insulated from the Company’s general account
    liabilities; (iii) investments are directed by the
    contractholder; and (iv) all investment performance, net of
    contract fees and assessments, is passed through to the
    contractholder. The Company reports separate account assets
    meeting such criteria at their fair value which is based on the
    estimated fair values of the underlying assets comprising the
    portfolios of an individual separate account. Investment
    performance (including investment income, net investment gains
    (losses) and changes in unrealized gains (losses)) and the
    corresponding amounts credited to contractholders of such
    separate accounts are offset within the same line in the
    consolidated statements of operations. Separate accounts not
    meeting the above criteria are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accounting for these
    investments is consistent with the methodologies described
    herein for similar financial instruments held within the general
    account.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Financial
    Instruments

As more fully described in “Summary of Significant
    Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates,”
    effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted new OTTI
    guidance. This guidance amends the previously used methodology
    for determining whether an OTTI exists for fixed maturity
    securities, changes the presentation of OTTI for fixed maturity
    securities and requires additional disclosures for OTTI on fixed
    maturity and equity securities in interim and annual financial
    statements.

The Company’s net cumulative effect adjustment of adopting
    the OTTI guidance was an increase of $76 million to
    retained earnings with a corresponding increase to accumulated
    other comprehensive loss to reclassify the noncredit loss
    portion of previously recognized OTTI losses on fixed maturity
    securities held at April 1, 2009. This cumulative effect
    adjustment was comprised of an increase in the amortized cost
    basis of fixed maturity securities of $126 million, net of
    policyholder related amounts of $10 million and net of
    deferred income taxes of $40 million, resulting in the net
    cumulative effect adjustment of $76 million. The increase
    in the amortized cost basis of fixed maturity securities of
    $126 million by sector was as follows:
    $53 million — ABS, $43 million —
    RMBS, $17 million — U.S. corporate
    securities and $13 million — CMBS.

As a result of the adoption of the OTTI guidance, the
    Company’s pre-tax earnings for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 increased by $857 million, offset by
    an increase in other comprehensive loss representing OTTI
    relating to noncredit losses recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2009.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on
    disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging. This
    guidance requires enhanced qualitative disclosures about
    objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
    disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on
    derivative instruments and disclosures about credit risk-related
    contingent features in derivative agreements. The Company has
    provided all of the material disclosures in its consolidated
    financial statements.

The following new pronouncements relating to financial
    instruments had no material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements:

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively an update on accounting for transfers of financial
    assets and repurchase financing transactions. This update
    provides guidance for evaluating whether to account for a
    transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing as a
    single transaction or as two separate transactions.

MetLife,
    Inc.

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted new
    guidance on the recognition of interest income and impairment on
    purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that
    continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial
    assets. This new guidance more closely aligns the determination
    of whether an OTTI has occurred for a beneficial interest in a
    securitized financial asset with the original guidance for fixed
    maturity securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new guidance
    relating to application of the shortcut method of accounting for
    derivative instruments and hedging activities. This guidance
    permits interest rate swaps to have a non-zero fair value at
    inception when applying the shortcut method of assessing hedge
    effectiveness as long as the difference between the transaction
    price (zero) and the fair value (exit price), as defined by
    current accounting guidance on fair value measurements, is
    solely attributable to a bid-ask spread. In addition, entities
    are not precluded from applying the shortcut method of assessing
    hedge effectiveness in a hedging relationship of interest rate
    risk involving an interest bearing asset or liability in
    situations where the hedged item is not recognized for
    accounting purposes until settlement date as long as the period
    between trade date and settlement date of the hedged item is
    consistent with generally established conventions in the
    marketplace.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new guidance
    that permits a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
    recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a
    receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a
    payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same
    master netting arrangement that have been offset. This new
    guidance also includes certain terminology modifications. Upon
    adoption of this guidance, the Company did not change its
    accounting policy of not offsetting fair value amounts
    recognized for derivative instruments under master netting
    arrangements.

Business
    Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted revised
    guidance on business combinations and accounting for
    noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial
    statements. Under this new guidance:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
    combination that arise from contingencies are recognized at fair
    value if the acquisition-date fair value can be reasonably
    determined. If the fair value is not estimable, an asset or
    liability is recorded if existence or incurrence at the
    acquisition date is probable and its amount is reasonably
    estimable.

•

Changes in deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and
    income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally
    affect income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

Net income (loss) includes amounts attributable to
    noncontrolling interests.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

F-34


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.

The adoption of this guidance on a prospective basis did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. Financial statements and disclosures for periods
    prior to 2009 reflect the retrospective application of the
    accounting for noncontrolling interests as required under this
    guidance.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively new guidance on determination of the useful life
    of intangible assets. This guidance amends the factors that
    should be considered in developing renewal or extension
    assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset. This change is intended to improve the
    consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible
    asset and the period of expected future cash flows used to
    measure the fair value of the asset. The Company determines
    useful lives and provides all of the material disclosures
    prospectively on intangible assets acquired on or after
    January 1, 2009 in accordance with this guidance.

Fair
    Value

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new fair
    value measurements guidance which defines fair value,
    establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value,
    establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the observability of
    inputs used to measure fair value, and requires enhanced
    disclosures about fair value measurements and applied this
    guidance prospectively to assets and liabilities measured at
    fair value. The adoption of this guidance changed the valuation
    of certain freestanding derivatives by moving from a mid to bid
    pricing convention as it relates to certain volatility inputs,
    as well as the addition of liquidity adjustments and adjustments
    for risks inherent in a particular input or valuation technique.
    The adoption of this guidance also changed the valuation of the
    Company’s embedded derivatives, most significantly the
    valuation of embedded derivatives associated with certain
    guarantees on variable annuity contracts. The change in
    valuation of embedded derivatives associated with guarantees on
    annuity contracts resulted from the incorporation of risk
    margins associated with non-capital market inputs and the
    inclusion of the Company’s own credit standing in their
    valuation. At January 1, 2008, the impact of adopting the
    guidance on assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair
    value was $30 million ($19 million, net of income tax)
    and was recognized as a change in estimate in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations where it was presented in
    the respective statement of operations caption to which the item
    measured at estimated fair value is presented. There were no
    significant changes in estimated fair value of items measured at
    fair value and reflected in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss). The addition of risk margins and the
    Company’s own credit spread in the valuation of embedded
    derivatives associated with annuity contracts may result in
    significant volatility in the Company’s consolidated net
    income in future periods. The Company provided all of the
    material disclosures in Note 5.

In February 2007, the FASB issued guidance related to the fair
    value option for financial assets and financial liabilities.
    This guidance permits entities the option to measure most
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at
    specified election dates and to recognize related unrealized
    gains and losses in earnings. The fair value option is applied
    on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis upon adoption of the standard, upon the acquisition of an
    eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment
    or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair
    value election is an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option
    on fixed maturity and equity securities backing certain pension
    products sold in Brazil. Such securities are presented as
    trading securities in the consolidated balance sheets with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income. Previously, these securities were accounted
    for as

available-for-sale

securities and unrealized gains and losses on these securities
    were recorded as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s insurance joint
    venture in Japan also elected the fair value option for certain
    of its existing single premium deferred annuities and the assets
    supporting such

F-35


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

liabilities. The fair value option was elected to achieve
    improved reporting of the asset/liability matching associated
    with these products. Adoption of this guidance by the Company
    and its Japanese joint venture resulted in an increase in
    retained earnings of $27 million, net of income tax, at
    January 1, 2008. The election of the fair value option
    resulted in the reclassification of $10 million, net of
    income tax, of net unrealized gains from accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) to retained earnings on
    January 1, 2008.

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted new guidance
    on: (i) estimating the fair value of an asset or liability
    if there was a significant decrease in the volume and level of
    trading activity for these assets or liabilities; and
    (ii) identifying transactions that are not orderly. The
    Company has provided all of the material disclosures in its
    consolidated financial statements. This adoption did not have
    any other material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

The following new pronouncements relating to fair value had no
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements:

•

Effective September 30, 2008, the Company adopted new
    guidance relating to the fair value measurements of financial
    assets when the market for those assets is not active. It
    provides guidance on how a company’s internal cash flow and
    discount rate assumptions should be considered in the
    measurement of fair value when relevant market data does not
    exist, how observable market information in an inactive market
    affects fair value measurement and how the use of market quotes
    should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable
    and unobservable data available to measure fair value.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company implemented fair
    value measurements guidance for certain nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring
    basis. This guidance applies to such items as:
    (i) nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at estimated fair value in a business
    combination; (ii) reporting units measured at estimated
    fair value in the first step of a goodwill impairment test; and
    (iii) indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at
    estimated fair value for impairment assessment.

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted
    prospectively guidance on issuer’s accounting for
    liabilities measured at fair value with a third-party credit
    enhancement. This guidance states that an issuer of a liability
    with a third-party credit enhancement should not include the
    effect of the credit enhancement in the fair value measurement
    of the liability. In addition, it requires disclosures about the
    existence of any third-party credit enhancement related to
    liabilities that are measured at fair value.

•

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted new
    guidance on: (i) measuring the fair value of investments in
    certain entities that calculate NAV per share; (ii) how
    investments within its scope would be classified in the fair
    value hierarchy; and (iii) enhanced disclosure
    requirements, for both interim and annual periods, about the
    nature and risks of investments measured at fair value on a
    recurring or non-recurring basis.

•

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted new
    guidance on measuring liabilities at fair value. This guidance
    provides clarification for measuring fair value in circumstances
    in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical
    liability is not available. In such circumstances a company is
    required to measure fair value using either a valuation
    technique that uses: (i) the quoted price of the identical
    liability when traded as an asset; or (ii) quoted prices
    for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as
    assets; or (iii) another valuation technique that is
    consistent with the principles of fair value measurement such as
    an income approach (e.g., present value technique) or a market
    approach (e.g., “entry” value technique).

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2009, the Company adopted new
    guidance to enhance the transparency surrounding the types of
    assets and associated risks in an employer’s defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans. This
    guidance requires an employer to disclose information about the
    valuation of plan assets similar to that required under other
    fair value disclosure guidance. The Company provided all of the
    material disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

Other
    Pronouncements

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company adopted prospectively
    new guidance which establishes general standards for accounting
    and disclosures of events that occur subsequent to the balance
    sheet date but before financial statements are issued or
    available to be issued. The Company has provided all of the
    required disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted new
    guidance relating to disclosures by public entities about
    transfers of financial assets and interests in VIEs. This
    guidance requires additional qualitative and quantitative
    disclosures about a transferors’ continuing involvement in
    transferred financial assets and involvement in VIEs. The exact
    nature of the additional required VIE disclosures vary and
    depend on whether or not the VIE is a qualifying special purpose
    entity (“QSPE”). For VIEs that are QSPEs, the
    additional disclosures are only required for a non-transferor
    sponsor holding a variable interest or a non-transferor servicer
    holding a significant variable interest. For VIEs that are not
    QSPEs, the additional disclosures are only required if the
    Company is the primary beneficiary, and if not the primary
    beneficiary, only if the Company holds a significant variable
    interest in the VIE or is its sponsor. The Company provided all
    of the material disclosures in its consolidated financial
    statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new guidance
    on income taxes. This guidance clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income tax recognized in a company’s
    financial statements. It requires companies to determine whether
    it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will
    be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing
    authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in
    the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the
    recognition, measurement and classification of income tax
    uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties.
    Previously recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this
    standard are required to be charged to earnings in the period
    that such determination is made. As a result of the
    implementation, the Company recognized a $35 million
    increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
    $9 million decrease in the interest liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, as well as a $17 million
    increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
    $5 million increase in the interest liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits which are included in liabilities of
    subsidiaries

held-for-sale.

The corresponding reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance
    of retained earnings was $37 million, net of
    $11 million of noncontrolling interests.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted new guidance
    on accounting by insurance enterprises for DAC on internal
    replacements of insurance and investment contracts other than
    those specifically described in guidance relating to accounting
    and reporting by insurance enterprises for long-duration
    contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of
    investments. As a result of the adoption of the new guidance, if
    an internal replacement modification substantially changes a
    contract, then the DAC is written off immediately through income
    and any new deferrable costs associated with the new replacement
    are deferred. If a contract modification does not substantially
    change the contract, the DAC amortization on the original
    contract will continue and any acquisition costs associated with
    the related modification are immediately expensed. The adoption
    of this guidance resulted in a reduction to DAC and VOBA on
    January 1, 2007 and an acceleration of the amortization
    period relating primarily to the Company’s group life and
    health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset
    provisions. Prior to the adoption, DAC on such contracts was
    amortized over the expected renewable life of the contract. Upon
    adoption, DAC on such contracts is to be amortized over the rate
    reset period. The impact as of January 1, 2007 was a
    cumulative effect adjustment of $292 million, net of income
    tax of $161 million, which was recorded as a reduction to
    retained earnings.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The following new pronouncements had no material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements:

•

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company adopted guidance on
    determining whether an instrument (or embedded feature) is
    indexed to an entity’s own stock. This guidance provides a
    framework for evaluating the terms of a particular instrument
    and whether such terms qualify the instrument as being indexed
    to an entity’s own stock.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted new guidance
    on written loan commitments recorded at fair value through
    earnings. It provides guidance on (i) incorporating
    expected net future cash flows when related to the associated
    servicing of a loan when measuring fair value; and
    (ii) broadening the SEC staff’s view that
    internally-developed intangible assets should not be recorded as
    part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment or to
    written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value
    through earnings. Internally-developed intangible assets are not
    considered a component of the related instruments.

•

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company prospectively
    adopted new guidance on the sale of real estate when the
    agreement includes a buy-sell clause. This guidance addresses
    whether the existence of a buy-sell arrangement would preclude
    partial sales treatment when real estate is sold to a jointly
    owned entity and concludes that the existence of a buy-sell
    clause does not necessarily preclude partial sale treatment
    under current guidance.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued new guidance that requires new
    disclosures about significant transfers in

and/or

out
    of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and activity
    in Level 3 (Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)

2010-06,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820):
    Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements

). In
    addition, this guidance provides clarification of existing
    disclosure requirements about (a) level of disaggregation
    and (b) inputs and valuation techniques. The update is
    effective for the first quarter of 2010. The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued additional guidance related to
    financial instrument transfers (ASU

2009-16,

Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860): Accounting for Transfers
    of Financial Assets)

and evaluation of VIEs for
    consolidation (ASU

2009-17,

Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial
    Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest
    Entities)

. The guidance is effective for the first quarter
    of 2010:

•

The financial instrument transfer guidance eliminates the
    concept of a “QSPE,” eliminates the guaranteed
    mortgage securitization exception, changes the criteria for
    achieving sale accounting when transferring a financial asset
    and changes the initial recognition of retained beneficial
    interests. The guidance also requires additional disclosures
    about transfers of financial assets, including securitized
    transactions, as well as a company’s continuing involvement
    in transferred financial assets. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

The consolidation guidance relating to VIEs changes the
    determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE from a
    quantitative model to a qualitative model. Under the new
    qualitative model, the primary beneficiary must have both the
    ability to direct the activities of the VIE and the obligation
    to absorb either losses or gains that could be significant to
    the VIE. The guidance also changes when reassessment is needed,
    as well as requires enhanced disclosures, including the effects
    of a company’s involvement with VIEs on its financial
    statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of the new
    guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

    Disposition

On March 2, 2009, the Company sold Cova Corporation
    (“Cova”), the parent company of Texas Life Insurance
    Company (“Texas Life”) to a third-party for
    $130 million in cash consideration, excluding
    $1 million of transaction costs. The net assets sold were
    $101 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of
    $28 million, net of income tax. The Company also
    reclassified $4 million, net of income tax, of the 2009
    operations of Texas Life into discontinued operations in the
    consolidated financial statements. As a result, the Company
    recognized income from discontinued operations of
    $32 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2009. See also Note 23.

    Disposition

In September 2008, the Company completed a tax-free split-off of
    its majority-owned subsidiary, Reinsurance Group of America,
    Incorporated (“RGA”). The Company and RGA entered into
    a recapitalization and distribution agreement, pursuant to which
    the Company agreed to divest substantially all of its 52%
    interest in RGA to the Company’s stockholders. The
    split-off was effected through the following:

•

A recapitalization of RGA common stock into two classes of
    common stock — RGA Class A common stock and RGA
    Class B common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
    recapitalization, each outstanding share of RGA common stock,
    including the 32,243,539 shares of RGA common stock
    beneficially owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, was
    reclassified as one share of RGA Class A common stock.
    Immediately thereafter, the Company and its subsidiaries
    exchanged 29,243,539 shares of its RGA Class A common
    stock — which represented all of the RGA Class A
    common stock beneficially owned by the Company and its
    subsidiaries other than 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock — with RGA for
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock.

•

An exchange offer, pursuant to which the Company offered to
    acquire MetLife common stock from its stockholders in exchange
    for all of its 29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common
    stock. The exchange ratio was determined based upon a ratio of
    the value of the MetLife and RGA shares during the

three-day

period prior to the closing of the exchange offer. The
    3,000,000 shares of the RGA Class A common stock were
    not subject to the tax-free exchange.

As a result of completion of the recapitalization and exchange
    offer, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock with a market value of $1,318 million and, in
    exchange, delivered 29,243,539 shares of RGA’s
    Class B common stock with a net book value of
    $1,716 million. The resulting loss on disposition,
    inclusive of transaction costs of $60 million, was
    $458 million. During the third quarter of 2009, the Company
    incurred $2 million, net of income tax, of additional costs
    related to this split-off. The 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock retained by the Company are marketable
    equity securities which do not constitute significant continuing
    involvement in the operations of RGA; accordingly, they have
    been classified within equity securities in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company at a cost basis of
    $157 million which is equivalent to the net book value of
    the shares. The cost basis will be adjusted to fair value at
    each subsequent reporting date. The Company has agreed to
    dispose of the remaining shares of RGA within the next five
    years. In connection with the Company’s agreement to
    dispose of the remaining shares, the Company also recognized, in
    its provision for income tax on continuing operations, a
    deferred tax liability of $16 million which represents the
    difference between the book and taxable basis of the remaining
    investment in RGA.

The impact of the disposition of the Company’s investment
    in RGA is reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements as discontinued operations.

    Acquisitions

During 2008, the Company made five acquisitions for
    $783 million. As a result of these acquisitions,
    MetLife’s Insurance Products segment increased its product
    offering of dental and vision benefit plans, MetLife Bank within
    Banking, Corporate & Other entered the mortgage
    origination and servicing business and the International segment
    increased its presence in Mexico and Brazil. The acquisitions
    were each accounted for using the purchase method of accounting,
    and accordingly, commenced being included in the operating
    results of the Company upon their respective closing dates.
    Total consideration paid by the Company for these acquisitions
    consisted of $763 million in cash and $20 million in
    transaction costs. The net fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed totaled $527 million, resulting in
    goodwill of $256 million. Goodwill increased by
    $122 million, $73 million and $61 million in the
    International segment, Insurance Products segment and Banking,
    Corporate & Other, respectively. The goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes. VOCRA, VOBA and other intangibles
    increased by $137 million, $7 million and
    $6 million, respectively, as a result of these
    acquisitions. Further information on VOBA, goodwill and VOCRA is
    provided in Notes 6, 7 and 8, respectively.

    Acquisition and Dispositions

In June 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in
    a joint venture in Hong Kong, MetLife Fubon Limited
    (“MetLife Fubon”), for $56 million in cash,
    resulting in MetLife Fubon becoming a consolidated subsidiary of
    the Company. The transaction was treated as a step acquisition,
    and at June 30, 2007, total assets and liabilities of
    MetLife Fubon of $839 million and $735 million,
    respectively, were included in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. The Company’s investment for the initial
    50% interest in MetLife Fubon was $48 million. The Company
    used the equity method of accounting for such investment in
    MetLife Fubon. The Company’s share of the joint
    venture’s results for the six months ended June 30,
    2007, was a loss of $3 million. The fair value of assets
    acquired and the liabilities assumed in the step acquisition at
    June 30, 2007, was $427 million and $371 million,
    respectively. No additional goodwill was recorded as a part of
    the step acquisition. As a result of this acquisition,
    additional VOBA and VODA of $45 million and
    $5 million, respectively, were recorded and both have a
    weighted average amortization period of 16 years. In June
    2008, the Company revised the valuation of certain long-term
    liabilities, VOBA and VODA based on new information received. As
    a result, the fair value of acquired insurance liabilities and
    VOBA were reduced by $5 million and $12 million,
    respectively, offset by an increase in VODA of $7 million.
    The revised VOBA and VODA have a weighted average amortization
    period of 11 years. Further information on VOBA and VODA is
    described in Notes 6 and 8, respectively.

In August 2007, MetLife Insurance Limited completed the sale of
    its annuities and pension businesses to a third-party for
    $25 million in cash consideration resulting in a gain upon
    disposal of $41 million, net of income tax.

In June 2007, the Company completed the sale of its Bermuda
    insurance subsidiary, MetLife International Insurance, Ltd.
    (“MLII”), to a third-party for $33 million in
    cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon disposal of
    $3 million, net of income tax. The net assets of MLII at
    disposal were $27 million. A liability of $1 million
    was recorded with respect to a guarantee provided in connection
    with this disposition and remains outstanding at
    December 31, 2009. Further information on guarantees is
    described in Note 16.

    Disposition through Assumption Reinsurance

On October 30, 2009, the Company completed the disposal,
    through assumption reinsurance, of substantially all of the
    insurance business of MetLife Canada, a wholly-owned indirect
    subsidiary, to a third-party. Pursuant to the assumption
    reinsurance agreement, the consideration paid by the Company was
    $259 million, comprised of cash of $14 million and
    fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans and other assets
    totaling $245 million. At the date of the assumption
    reinsurance agreement, the carrying value of insurance
    liabilities transferred was $267 million, resulting in a
    gain of $5 million, net of income tax. The gain was
    recognized in net investment gains (losses).

The Company has classified within the U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed securities caption certain corporate fixed
    maturity securities issued by U.S. financial institutions that
    were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    (“FDIC”) pursuant to the FDIC’s Temporary
    Liquidity Guarantee Program (“FDIC Program”) of
    $407 million and $2 million at estimated fair value
    with unrealized gains (losses) of $2 million and less than
    ($1) million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

(2)

At time of acquisition, the Company classifies perpetual
    securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed
    maturity securities if the security has a punitive interest rate

step-up

feature, as it believes in most instances this feature will
    compel the issuer to redeem the security at the specified call
    date. Perpetual securities that do not have a punitive interest
    rate

step-up

feature are classified as equity securities within
    non-redeemable preferred stock. Many of such securities have
    been issued by

non-U.S.

financial institutions that are accorded Tier 1 and Upper
    Tier 2 capital treatment by their respective regulatory
    bodies and are commonly referred to as “perpetual hybrid
    securities.” The following table presents the perpetual

Collateralized mortgage obligations are a type of
    mortgage-backed security structured by dividing the cash flows
    of mortgages into separate pools or tranches of risk that create
    multiple classes of bonds with varying maturities and priority
    of payments. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities are a type
    of asset-backed security that is secured by a mortgage or
    collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage payments from
    homeowners pass from the originating bank through an
    intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank,
    which collects the payments, and for a fee, remits or passes
    these payments through to the holders of the pass-through
    securities.

Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of
    residential mortgage loans to the most credit-worthy borrowers
    with high quality credit profiles. Alternative residential
    mortgage loans (“Alt-A”) are a classification of
    mortgage loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls
    between prime and

sub-prime.

Sub-prime

mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage
    loans to borrowers with weak credit profiles. During 2009, there
    were significant ratings downgrades from investment grade to
    below investment grade for non-agency RMBS, both Alt-A and prime
    RMBS, contributing to the decrease in the percentage of RMBS
    with a Aaa/AAA rating to 80.9% at December 31, 2009 as
    compared to 92.3% at December 31, 2008, and a decrease in
    RMBS with a rating of NAIC 1 to 87.4% at December 31, 2009
    as compared to 95.8% at December 31, 2008. These downgrades
    also contributed to the substantial decrease presented below in
    the Company’s Alt-A securities holdings rated Aa/AA or
    better or rated NAIC 1 as compared to December 31, 2008.

Evaluating

Available-for-Sale

Securities for

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment

As described more fully in Note 1, the Company performs a
    regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its

available-for-sale

securities holdings in accordance with its impairment policy in
    order to evaluate whether such investments are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    April 1, 2009, the Company adopted new OTTI guidance that
    amends the methodology for determining for fixed maturity
    securities whether an OTTI exists, and for certain fixed
    maturity securities, changes how the amount of the OTTI loss
    that is charged to earnings is determined. There was no change
    in the OTTI methodology for equity securities.

With respect to fixed maturity securities, the Company
    considers, amongst other impairment criteria, whether it has the
    intent to sell a particular impaired fixed maturity security.
    The Company’s intent to sell a particular impaired fixed
    maturity security considers broad portfolio management
    objectives such as asset/liability duration management, issuer
    and industry segment exposures, interest rate views and the
    overall total return focus. In following these portfolio
    management objectives, changes in facts and circumstances that
    were present in past reporting periods may trigger a decision to
    sell securities that were held in prior reporting periods.
    Decisions to sell are based on current conditions or the
    Company’s need to shift the portfolio to maintain its
    portfolio management objectives including liquidity needs or
    duration targets on asset/liability managed portfolios. The
    Company attempts to anticipate these types of changes and if a
    sale decision has been made on an impaired security, the
    security will be deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an
    OTTI loss will be recorded in earnings. In certain
    circumstances, the Company may determine that it does not intend
    to sell a particular security but that it is more likely than
    not that it will be required to sell that security before
    recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below amortized
    cost. In such instances, the fixed maturity security will be
    deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period during which it was determined more
    likely than not that the security will be required to be sold
    and an OTTI loss will be recorded in earnings. If the Company
    does not have the intent to sell (i.e., has not made the
    decision to sell) and it does not believe that it is more likely
    than not that it will be required to sell the security before
    recovery of its amortized cost, an impairment assessment is
    made, as described in Note 1. Prior to April 1, 2009,
    the Company’s assessment of OTTI for fixed maturity
    securities was performed in the same manner as described below
    for equity securities.

F-50


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

With respect to equity securities, the Company considers in its
    OTTI analysis its intent and ability to hold a particular equity
    security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the
    recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than
    cost. Decisions to sell equity securities are based on current
    conditions in relation to the same broad portfolio management
    considerations in a manner consistent with that described above
    for fixed maturity securities.

With respect to perpetual hybrid securities, some of which are
    classified as fixed maturity securities and some of which are
    classified as equity securities, within non-redeemable preferred
    stock, the Company considers in its OTTI analysis whether there
    has been any deterioration in credit of the issuer and the
    likelihood of recovery in value of the securities that are in a
    severe and extended unrealized loss position. The Company also
    considers whether any perpetual hybrid securities with an
    unrealized loss, regardless of credit rating, have deferred any
    dividend payments.

The fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss greater than $10 million, decreased
    $10.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2009.
    These securities were included in the Company’s OTTI review
    process. Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of
    these securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the
    cause of the decline in, or improvement in, gross unrealized
    losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 being primarily
    attributable to improving market conditions, including narrowing
    of credit spreads reflecting an improvement in liquidity and the
    Company’s current intentions and assessments (as applicable
    to the type of security) about holding, selling and any
    requirements to sell these securities, the Company has concluded
    that these securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    and severity of an unrealized loss position for equity
    securities is given greater weight and consideration than for
    fixed maturity securities. An extended and severe unrealized
    loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any
    impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled
    interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or
    the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized
    cost based on the present value of the expected future cash
    flows to be collected. In contrast, for an equity security,
    greater weight and consideration is given by the Company to a
    decline in market value and the likelihood such market value
    decline will recover.

The following table presents certain information about the
    Company’s equity securities

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process at December 31, 2009, the Company evaluated its
    holdings in non-redeemable preferred stock, particularly those
    of financial services companies. The Company considered several
    factors including whether there has been any deterioration in
    credit of the issuer and the likelihood of recovery in value of
    non-redeemable preferred stock with a severe or an extended
    unrealized loss. The Company also considered whether any
    non-redeemable preferred stock with an unrealized loss,
    regardless of credit rating, have deferred any dividend
    payments. No such dividend payments were deferred.

With respect to common stock holdings, the Company considered
    the duration and severity of the unrealized losses for
    securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more; and
    the duration of unrealized losses for securities in an
    unrealized loss position of 20% or less in an extended
    unrealized loss position (i.e., 12 months or greater).

Future

other-than-temporary

impairments will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
    issuer performance (including changes in the present value of
    future cash flows expected to be collected), changes in credit
    rating, changes in collateral valuation, changes in interest
    rates and changes in credit spreads. If economic fundamentals
    and any of the above factors deteriorate, additional

other-than-temporary

impairments may be incurred in upcoming quarters.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

As described more fully in Note 1, effective April 1,
    2009, the Company adopted new guidance on the recognition and
    presentation of OTTI that amends the methodology to determine
    for fixed maturity securities whether an OTTI exists, and for
    certain fixed maturity securities, changes how OTTI losses that
    are charged to earnings are measured. There was no change in the
    methodology for identification and measurement of OTTI losses
    charged to earnings for impaired equity securities.

The Company periodically disposes of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss. Generally, such losses are insignificant
    in amount or in relation to the cost basis of the investment,
    are attributable to declines in estimated fair value occurring
    in the period of the disposition or are as a result of
    management’s decision to sell securities based on current
    conditions, or the Company’s need to shift the portfolio to
    maintain its portfolio management objectives. Investment gains
    and losses on sales of securities are determined on a specific
    identification basis.

Amounts are presented net of changes in estimated fair value of
    derivatives related to economic hedges of the Company’s
    investment in these equity method international joint
    investments that do not qualify for hedge accounting of ($143)
    million, $178 million and $12 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The current
    year losses were primarily attributable to losses on equity
    derivatives and losses on foreign currency derivatives (both of
    which are  used to hedge embedded derivative risk) due to
    improving equity markets in the current period and the U.S.
    Dollar weakening against several major foreign currencies. In
    addition, included in the equity in earnings of the joint
    ventures were losses attributable to the narrowing of the
    Company’s own credit spread, which is included in the
    valuation of certain liabilities, including embedded
    derivatives, that are carried at estimated fair value.

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities and short-term investments, are loaned to third
    parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. The
    Company generally obtains collateral in an amount equal to 102%
    of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned. Securities
    loaned under such transactions may be sold or repledged by the
    transferee. The Company is liable to return to its
    counterparties the cash collateral under its control, the
    amounts of which by aging category are presented below.

    $3,193 million from $4,986 million at
    December 31, 2008. Of the $3,193 million of estimated
    fair value of the securities related to the cash collateral on
    open at December 31, 2009, $3,012 million were
    U.S. Treasury, agency and government guaranteed securities
    which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy
    the cash requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan,
    related to the cash collateral aged less than thirty days to
    ninety days or greater, was primarily U.S. Treasury, agency
    and government guaranteed securities, and very liquid RMBS. The
    reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash collateral
    consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including

    information on MSRs. Joint venture investments are accounted for
    on the equity method and represent the Company’s investment
    in insurance underwriting joint ventures in Japan, Chile and
    China. Tax credit partnerships are established for the purpose
    of investing in low-income housing and other social causes,
    where the primary return on investment is in the form of tax
    credits, and are accounted for under the equity method or under
    the effective yield method. Funds withheld represent amounts
    contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with
    reinsurance agreements. Funding agreements represent
    arrangements where the Company has long-term interest bearing
    amounts on deposit with third parties and are generally stated
    at amortized cost.

    generated from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans
    where the servicing rights are retained by the Company. MSRs are
    carried at estimated fair value and changes in estimated fair
    value, primarily due to changes in valuation inputs and
    assumptions and to the collection of expected cash flows, are
    reported in other revenues in the period in which the change
    occurs. See also Note 5 for further information about how
    the estimated fair value of MSRs is determined and other related
    information.

is equal to the carrying amounts or carrying amounts of retained
    interests. The maximum exposure to loss relating to the real
    estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests is
    equal to the carrying amounts plus any unfunded commitments.
    Such a maximum loss would be expected to occur only upon
    bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. For certain of its
    investments in other invested assets, the Company’s return
    is in the form of tax credits which are guaranteed by a
    creditworthy third-party. For such investments, the maximum
    exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts plus any
    unfunded commitments, reduced by amounts guaranteed by third
    parties of $232 million and $278 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

As described in Note 16, the Company makes commitments to
    fund partnership investments in the normal course of business.
    Excluding these commitments, the Company did not provide
    financial or other support to investees designated as VIEs
    during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce
    market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter
    interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets
    and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap,
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
    interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed
    notional principal amount. These transactions are entered into
    pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date. The
    Company utilizes interest rate swaps in fair value, cash flow
    and non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company also enters into basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows from assets and related liabilities. In a basis swap,
    both legs of the swap are floating with each based on a
    different index. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset
    of the contract and no principal payments are made by either
    party. A single net payment is usually made by one counterparty
    at each due date. Basis swaps are included in interest rate
    swaps in the preceding table. The Company utilizes basis swaps
    in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Inflation swaps are used as an economic hedge to reduce
    inflation risk generated from inflation-indexed liabilities.
    Inflation swaps are included in interest rate swaps in the
    preceding table. The Company utilizes inflation swaps in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Implied volatility swaps are used by the Company primarily as
    economic hedges of interest rate risk associated with the
    Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities. In an
    implied volatility swap, the Company exchanges fixed payments
    for floating payments that are linked to certain market
    volatility measures. If implied volatility rises, the floating
    payments that the Company receives will increase, and if implied
    volatility falls, the floating payments that the Company
    receives will decrease. Implied volatility swaps are included in
    interest rate swaps in the preceding table. The Company utilizes
    implied volatility swaps in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company purchases interest rate caps and floors primarily to
    protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in interest
    rates above a specified level, and against interest rate
    exposure arising from mismatches between

F-74


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

assets and liabilities (duration mismatches), as well as to
    protect its minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines
    in interest rates below a specified level, respectively. In
    certain instances, the Company locks in the economic impact of
    existing purchased caps and floors by entering into offsetting
    written caps and floors. The Company utilizes interest rate caps
    and floors in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures
    transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a specified
    number of contracts, the value of which is determined by the
    different classes of interest rate securities, and to post
    variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the
    difference in the daily market values of those contracts. The
    Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.
    Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are
    used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of
    assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported
    by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities
    the Company owns or anticipates acquiring and to hedge against
    changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by
    replicating Treasury or swap curve performance. The Company
    utilizes exchange-traded interest rate futures in non-qualifying
    hedging relationships.

Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk
    associated with the Company’s long-term liabilities. A
    swaption is an option to enter into a swap with a forward
    starting effective date. In certain instances, the Company locks
    in the economic impact of existing purchased swaptions by
    entering into offsetting written swaptions. The Company pays a
    premium for purchased swaptions and receives a premium for
    written swaptions. Swaptions are included in interest rate
    options in the preceding table. The Company utilizes swaptions
    in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company writes covered call options on its portfolio of
    U.S. Treasuries as an income generation strategy. In a
    covered call transaction, the Company receives a premium at the
    inception of the contract in exchange for giving the derivative
    counterparty the right to purchase the referenced security from
    the Company at a predetermined price. The call option is
    “covered” because the Company owns the referenced
    security over the term of the option. Covered call options are
    included in interest rate options in the preceding table. The
    Company utilizes covered call options in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

The Company enters into interest rate forwards to buy and sell
    securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract
    and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
    date. The Company also uses interest rate forwards to sell to be
    announced securities as economic hedges against the risk of
    changes in the fair value of mortgage loans

held-for-sale

and interest rate lock commitments. The Company utilizes
    interest rate forwards in cash flow and non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Interest rate lock commitments are short-term commitments to
    fund mortgage loan applications in process (the pipeline) for a
    fixed term at a fixed price. During the term of an interest rate
    lock commitment, the Company is exposed to the risk that
    interest rates will change from the rate quoted to the potential
    borrower. Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans
    that will be

held-for-sale

are considered derivative instruments. Interest rate lock
    commitments are included in interest rate forwards in the
    preceding table. Interest rate lock commitments are not
    designated as hedging instruments.

A synthetic GIC is a contract that simulates the performance of
    a traditional guaranteed interest contract through the use of
    financial instruments. Under a synthetic GIC, the policyholder
    owns the underlying assets. The Company guarantees a rate return
    on those assets for a premium. Synthetic GICs are not designated
    as hedging instruments.

Foreign currency derivatives, including foreign currency swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and currency option contracts, are
    used by the Company to reduce the risk from fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also
    uses foreign currency forwards and swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency risk associated with certain of its net investments in
    foreign operations.

In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the
    difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange
    rate, generally set at inception,

F-75


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

calculated by reference to an agreed upon principal amount. The
    principal amount of each currency is exchanged at the inception
    and termination of the currency swap by each party. The Company
    utilizes foreign currency swaps in fair value, cash flow, net
    investment in foreign operations and non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees
    with another party to deliver a specified amount of an
    identified currency at a specified future date. The price is
    agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a
    contract is made in a different currency at the specified future
    date. The Company utilizes foreign currency forwards in net
    investment in foreign operations and non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

The Company enters into currency option contracts that give it
    the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency
    amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a
    limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be
    net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign
    exchange rate and the strike price. The Company uses currency
    options to hedge against the foreign currency exposure inherent
    in certain of its variable annuity products. The Company also
    uses currency options as an economic hedge of foreign currency
    exposure related to the Company’s international
    subsidiaries. The Company utilizes currency options in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

The Company uses certain of its foreign currency denominated
    funding agreements to hedge portions of its net investments in
    foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.
    Such contracts are included in non-derivative hedging
    instruments in the preceding table.

Swap spreadlocks are used by the Company to hedge invested
    assets on an economic basis against the risk of changes in
    credit spreads. Swap spreadlocks are forward transactions
    between two parties whose underlying reference index is a
    forward starting interest rate swap where the Company agrees to
    pay a coupon based on a predetermined reference swap spread in
    exchange for receiving a coupon based on a floating rate. The
    Company has the option to cash settle with the counterparty in
    lieu of maintaining the swap after the effective date. The
    Company utilizes swap spreadlocks in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Certain credit default swaps are used by the Company to hedge
    against credit-related changes in the value of its investments
    and to diversify its credit risk exposure in certain portfolios.
    In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party, at specified intervals, to pay a premium to hedge
    credit risk. If a credit event, as defined by the contract,
    occurs, generally the contract will require the swap to be
    settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the
    referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional in
    exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty
    equal to the par value of the investment surrendered. The
    Company utilizes credit default swaps in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

Credit default swaps are also used to synthetically create
    investments that are either more expensive to acquire or
    otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions
    are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as
    a U.S. Treasury or Agency security. The Company also enters
    into certain credit default swaps held in relation to trading
    portfolios for the purpose of generating profits on short-term
    differences in price. These credit default swaps are not
    designated as hedging instruments.

The Company enters into forwards to lock in the price to be paid
    for forward purchases of certain securities. The price is agreed
    upon at the time of the contract and payment for the contract is
    made at a specified future date. When the primary purpose of
    entering into these transactions is to hedge against the risk of
    changes in purchase price due to changes in credit spreads, the
    Company designates these as credit forwards. The Company
    utilizes credit forwards in cash flow hedging relationships.

In exchange-traded equity futures transactions, the Company
    agrees to purchase or sell a specified number of contracts, the
    value of which is determined by the different classes of equity
    securities, and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an
    amount equal to the difference in the daily market values of
    those contracts. The Company enters into exchange-traded futures
    with regulated futures commission merchants that are members of
    the exchange. Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily
    to hedge liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity
    products offered by the Company. The Company utilizes
    exchange-traded equity futures in non-qualifying hedging
    relationships.

    Statements — (Continued)

Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in
    equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the
    equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The
    contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in
    the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. In
    certain instances, the Company may enter into a combination of
    transactions to hedge adverse changes in equity indices within a
    pre-determined range through the purchase and sale of options.
    Equity index options are included in equity options in the
    preceding table. The Company utilizes equity index options in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company
    agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future,
    based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period.
    Equity variance swaps are included in variance swaps in the
    preceding table. The Company utilizes equity variance swaps in
    non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”) are swaps whereby
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward
    of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference
    to an agreed notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at
    the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the
    life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that
    provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty
    at each due date. The Company uses TRRs to hedge its equity
    market guarantees in certain of its insurance products. TRRs can
    be used as hedges or to synthetically create investments. The
    Company utilizes TRRs in non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash
    flow hedges when they have met the requirements of cash flow
    hedging: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating rate
    investments to fixed rate investments; (ii) interest rate
    swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate
    liabilities; (iii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency
    denominated investments and liabilities; (iv) interest rate
    forwards and credit forwards to lock in the price to be paid for
    forward purchases of investments; and (v) interest rate
    swaps to hedge the forecasted purchases of fixed-rate
    investments.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recognized $3 million of net investment losses which
    represented the ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. For
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company did
    not recognize any net investment gains (losses) which
    represented the ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. All
    components of each derivative’s gain or loss were included
    in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In certain instances,
    the Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the
    forecasted transactions did not occur on the anticipated date or
    within two months of that date. The net amounts reclassified
    into net investment losses for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such discontinued cash flow
    hedges were $7 million, $12 million and
    $3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, the
    maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its
    exposure to variability in future cash flows for forecasted
    transactions does not exceed five years. There were no hedged
    forecasted transactions, other than the receipt or payment of
    variable interest payments for the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007.

Hedges
    of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company uses foreign exchange contracts, which may include
    foreign currency swaps, forwards and options, to hedge portions
    of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse
    movements in exchange rates. The Company measures
    ineffectiveness on these contracts based upon the change in
    forward rates. In addition, the Company may also use
    non-derivative financial instruments to hedge portions of its
    net investments in foreign

F-80

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. The
    Company measures ineffectiveness on non-derivative financial
    instruments based upon the change in spot rates.

When net investments in foreign operations are sold or
    substantially liquidated, the amounts in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of operations, while a pro rata portion will be
    reclassified upon partial sale of the net investments in foreign
    operations.

The following table presents the effects of derivatives and
    non-derivative financial instruments in net investment hedging
    relationships in the consolidated statements of operations and
    the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007:

During the year-ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    substantially liquidated, through assumption reinsurance (see
    Note 2), the portion of its Canadian operations that was
    being hedged in a net investment hedging relationship. As a
    result, the Company reclassified losses of $133 million
    from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings. During
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were no
    sales or substantial liquidations of net investments in foreign
    operations that would have required the reclassification of
    gains or losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into
    earnings.

(2)

There was no ineffectiveness recognized for the Company’s
    hedges of net investments in foreign operations.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the cumulative foreign
    currency translation gain (loss) recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss related to hedges of net investments in
    foreign operations was ($40) million and $126 million,
    respectively.

Non-Qualifying
    Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than
    Hedging

The Company enters into the following derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting or for purposes other than hedging:
    (i) interest rate swaps, implied volatility swaps, caps and
    floors and interest rate futures to economically hedge its
    exposure to interest rates; (ii) foreign currency forwards,
    swaps and option contracts to economically hedge its exposure to
    adverse movements in exchange rates; (iii) credit default
    swaps to economically hedge exposure to adverse movements in
    credit; (iv) equity futures, equity index options, interest
    rate futures, TRRs and equity variance swaps to economically
    hedge liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products;
    (v) swap spreadlocks to economically hedge invested assets
    against the risk of changes in credit spreads;
    (vi) interest rate forwards to buy and sell securities to
    economically hedge its exposure to interest rates;
    (vii) credit default swaps and TRRs to synthetically create
    investments; (viii) basis swaps to better match the cash
    flows of assets and related liabilities; (ix) credit
    default swaps held in relation to trading portfolios;
    (x) swaptions to hedge interest rate risk;
    (xi) inflation swaps to reduce risk generated from
    inflation-indexed liabilities; (xii) covered call options
    for income generation; (xiii) interest rate lock
    commitments; (xiv) synthetic GICs and (xv) equity
    options to economically hedge certain invested assets against
    adverse changes in equity indices.

    Derivatives

In connection with synthetically created investment transactions
    and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading
    portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it
    receives a premium to insure credit risk. Such credit
    derivatives are included within the non-qualifying derivatives
    and derivatives for purposes other than hedging table. If a
    credit event, as defined by the contract, occurs generally the
    contract will require the Company to pay the counterparty the
    specified swap notional amount in exchange for the delivery of
    par quantities of the referenced credit obligation. The
    Company’s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all
    referenced credit obligations is zero, was $3,101 million
    and $1,875 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The Company can terminate these contracts at any
    time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an amount
    equal to the then current fair value of the credit default
    swaps. At December 31, 2009, the Company would have

    Statements — (Continued)

received $53 million to terminate all of these contracts,
    and at December 31, 2008, the Company would have paid
    $37 million to terminate all of these contracts.

The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to
    purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit
    obligations in the table below. As a result, the maximum amounts
    of potential future recoveries available to offset the
    $3,101 million and $1,875 million from the table below
    were $31 million and $13 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The following table presents the
    estimated fair value, maximum amount of future payments and
    weighted average years to maturity of written credit default
    swaps at December 31, 2009 and 2008:

Credit
    Risk on Freestanding Derivatives

The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event
    of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
    instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the
    Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the net
    positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the
    reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of
    netting agreements and any collateral received pursuant to
    credit support annexes.

The Company manages its credit risk related to

over-the-counter

derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange-traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments. See Note 1
    for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation
    of derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. At December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the Company was obligated to return cash
    collateral under its control of $2,680 million and
    $7,758 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents or in
    short-term investments and the obligation to return it is
    included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and
    other transactions in the consolidated balance sheets. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had also accepted
    collateral consisting of various securities with a fair market
    value of $221 million and $1,249 million,
    respectively, which are held in separate custodial accounts. The
    Company is permitted by contract to sell or repledge this
    collateral, but at December 31, 2009, none of the
    collateral had been sold or repledged.

The Company’s collateral arrangements for its

over-the-counter

derivatives generally require the counterparty in a net
    liability position, after considering the effect of netting
    agreements, to pledge collateral when the fair value of that
    counterparty’s derivatives reaches a pre-determined
    threshold. Certain of these arrangements also include
    credit-contingent provisions that provide for a reduction of
    these thresholds (on a sliding scale that converges toward zero)
    in the event of downgrades in the credit ratings of the Company

and/or

the
    counterparty. In addition, certain of the Company’s netting
    agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that
    require the Company to maintain a specific investment grade
    credit rating from at least one of the major credit rating
    agencies. If the Company’s credit ratings were to fall
    below that specific investment grade credit rating, it would be
    in violation of these provisions, and the counterparties to the
    derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand
    immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on
    derivative instruments that are in a net liability position
    after considering the effect of netting agreements.

Included in fixed maturity securities in the consolidated
    balance sheets. The counterparties are permitted by contract to
    sell or repledge this collateral. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company did not provide any cash collateral.

Without considering the effect of netting agreements, the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s

over-the-counter

derivatives with credit-contingent provisions that were in a
    gross liability position at December 31, 2009 was
    $1,645 million. At December 31, 2009, the Company
    provided securities collateral of $1,017 million in
    connection with these derivatives. In the unlikely event that
    both: (i) the Company’s credit rating is downgraded to
    a level that triggers full overnight collateralization or
    termination of all derivative positions; and (ii) the
    Company’s netting agreements are deemed to be legally
    unenforceable, then the additional collateral that the Company
    would be required to provide to its counterparties in connection
    with its derivatives in a gross liability position at
    December 31, 2009 would be $628 million. This amount
    does not consider gross derivative assets of $488 million
    for which the Company has the contractual right of offset.

At December 31, 2008, the Company provided securities
    collateral for various arrangements in connection with
    derivative instruments of $776 million, which is included
    in fixed maturity securities. The counterparties are permitted
    by contract to sell or repledge this collateral.

The Company also has exchange-traded futures, which require the
    pledging of collateral. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company pledged securities collateral for exchange-traded
    futures of $50 million and $282 million, respectively,
    which is included in fixed maturity securities. The
    counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge
    this collateral. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company
    provided cash collateral for exchange-traded futures of
    $562 million and $686 million, respectively, which is
    included in premiums and other receivables.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company has certain embedded derivatives that are required
    to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as
    derivatives. These host contracts principally include: variable
    annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits, including GMWBs,
    GMABs and certain GMIBs; ceded reinsurance contracts of
    guaranteed minimum benefits related to GMABs and certain GMIBs;
    and funding agreements with equity or bond indexed crediting

    assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Trading
    Securities

— When available, the estimated fair
    value of the Company’s fixed maturity, equity and trading
    securities are based on quoted prices in active markets that are
    readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most
    liquid of the Company’s securities holdings and valuation
    of these securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    inputs in applying these market standard valuation methodologies
    include, but are not limited to: interest rates, credit standing
    of the issuer or counterparty, industry sector of the issuer,
    coupon rate, call provisions, sinking fund requirements,
    maturity and management’s assumptions regarding estimated
    duration, liquidity and estimated future cash flows.
    Accordingly, the estimated fair values are based on available
    market information and management’s judgments about
    financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted
    prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and
    spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities and are considered appropriate given the
    circumstances.

The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs may
    have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the
    Company’s securities holdings.

Mortgage Loans —

The Company originates
    mortgage loans for both investment purposes and with the
    intention to sell them to third parties. Commercial and
    agricultural mortgage loans are originated for investment
    purposes and are primarily carried at amortized cost.
    Residential mortgage and consumer loans are generally purchased
    from third parties for investment purposes and are primarily
    carried at amortized cost. Mortgage loans

held-for-sale

consist principally of residential mortgage loans for which the
    Company has elected the fair value option and which are carried
    at estimated fair value and to a significantly lesser degree
    certain mortgage loans which were previously

held-for-investment

but where the Company has changed its intention as it relates to
    holding them for investment. The estimated fair values of these
    mortgage loans are determined as follows:

Mortgage Loans

Held-for-Investment

—
    For mortgage loans

held-for-investment

and carried at amortized cost, estimated fair value was
    primarily determined by estimating expected future cash flows
    and discounting them using current interest rates for similar
    mortgage loans with similar credit risk.

MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Mortgage Loans

Held-for-Sale —

Mortgage loans

held-for-sale

principally include residential mortgage loans for which the
    fair value option was elected and which are carried at estimated
    fair value. Generally, quoted market prices are not available
    for residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale;

accordingly, the estimated fair values of such assets are
    determined based on observable pricing of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of mortgage loans, adjusted
    to convert the securities prices to mortgage loan prices. When
    observable pricing for similar loans or securities that are
    backed by similar loans are not available, the estimated fair
    values of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgage loans previously
    classified as

held-for-investment

have also been designated as

held-for-sale.

For these mortgage loans, estimated fair value is determined
    using independent broker quotations or, when the mortgage loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the fair value of the underlying collateral is
    estimated using internal models.

Policy Loans —

For policy loans with fixed
    interest rates, estimated fair values are determined using a
    discounted cash flow model applied to groups of similar policy
    loans determined by the nature of the underlying insurance
    liabilities. Cash flow estimates are developed applying a
    weighted-average interest rate to the outstanding principal
    balance of the respective group of policy loans and an estimated
    average maturity determined through experience studies of the
    past performance of policyholder repayment behavior for similar
    loans. These cash flows are discounted using current risk-free
    interest rates with no adjustment for borrower credit risk as
    these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value
    of the underlying insurance policy. The estimated fair value for
    policy loans with variable interest rates approximates carrying
    value due to the absence of borrower credit risk and the short
    time period between interest rate resets, which presents minimal
    risk of a material change in estimated fair value due to changes
    in market interest rates.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests

— Real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnership interests included in the preceding tables
    consist of those investments accounted for using the cost
    method. The remaining carrying value recognized in the
    consolidated balance sheets represents investments in real
    estate or real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnership interests accounted for using the equity method,
    which do not meet the definition of financial instruments for
    which fair value is required to be disclosed.

The estimated fair values for other limited partnership
    interests and real estate joint ventures accounted for under the
    cost method are generally based on the Company’s share of
    the NAV as provided in the financial statements of the
    investees. In certain circumstances, management may adjust the
    NAV by a premium or discount when it has sufficient evidence to
    support applying such adjustments.

Short-term Investments

— Certain short-term
    investments do not qualify as securities and are recognized at
    amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheets. For these
    instruments, the Company believes that there is minimal risk of
    material changes in interest rates or credit of the issuer such
    that estimated fair value approximates carrying value. In light
    of recent market conditions, short-term investments have been
    monitored to ensure there is sufficient demand and maintenance
    of issuer credit quality and the Company has determined
    additional adjustment is not required. Short-term investments
    that meet the definition of a security are recognized at
    estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheets in the
    same manner described above for similar instruments that are
    classified within captions of other major investment classes.

Other Invested Assets

— Other invested assets
    in the consolidated balance sheets are principally comprised of
    freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values,
    leveraged leases, joint venture investments, investments in tax
    credit partnerships, investment in a funding agreement, MSRs,
    funds withheld at interest and various interest-bearing assets
    held in foreign subsidiaries. Leveraged leases and investments
    in tax credit partnerships and joint venture investments, which
    are accounted for under the equity method or under the effective
    yield method, are not financial instruments subject to fair
    value disclosure. Accordingly, they have been excluded from the
    preceding table.

The estimated fair value of derivatives — with
    positive and negative estimated fair values — is
    described in the section labeled “Derivatives” which
    follows.

F-90


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Although MSRs are not financial instruments, the Company has
    included them in the preceding table as a result of its election
    to carry MSRs at estimated fair value. As sales of MSRs tend to
    occur in private transactions where the precise terms and
    conditions of the sales are typically not readily available,
    observable market valuations are limited. As such, the Company
    relies primarily on a discounted cash flow model to estimate the
    fair value of the MSRs. The model requires inputs such as type
    of loan (fixed vs. variable and agency vs. other), age of loan,
    loan interest rates and current market interest rates that are
    generally observable. The model also requires the use of
    unobservable inputs including assumptions regarding estimates of
    discount rates, loan prepayments and servicing costs.

The estimated fair value of the investment in funding agreements
    is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using
    current market rates and the credit risk of the note issuer.

For funds withheld at interest and the various interest-bearing
    assets held in foreign subsidiaries, the Company evaluates the
    specific facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine
    the appropriate estimated fair values. These estimated fair
    values were not materially different from the recognized
    carrying values.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Due to the
    short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, the Company
    believes there is minimal risk of material changes in interest
    rates or credit of the issuer such that estimated fair value
    generally approximates carrying value. In light of recent market
    conditions, cash and cash equivalent instruments have been
    monitored to ensure there is sufficient demand and maintenance
    of issuer credit quality, or sufficient solvency in the case of
    depository institutions, and the Company has determined
    additional adjustment is not required.

Accrued Investment Income

— Due to the
    short-term until settlement of accrued investment income, the
    Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes in
    interest rates or credit of the issuer such that estimated fair
    value approximates carrying value. In light of recent market
    conditions, the Company has monitored the credit quality of the
    issuers and has determined additional adjustment is not required.

Premiums and Other Receivables —

Premiums and
    other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets are
    principally comprised of premiums due and unpaid for insurance
    contracts, amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts,
    amounts on deposit with financial institutions to facilitate
    daily settlements related to certain derivative positions,
    amounts receivable for securities sold but not yet settled, fees
    and general operating receivables and embedded derivatives
    related to the ceded reinsurance of certain variable annuity
    guarantees.

Premiums receivable and those amounts recoverable under
    reinsurance treaties determined to transfer sufficient risk are
    not financial instruments subject to disclosure and thus have
    been excluded from the amounts presented in the preceding table.
    Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts, which the
    Company has determined do not transfer sufficient risk such that
    they are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting,
    have been included in the preceding table with the estimated
    fair value determined as the present value of expected future
    cash flows under the related contracts discounted using an
    interest rate determined to reflect the appropriate credit
    standing of the assuming counterparty.

The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements essentially
    represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances and amounts
    due for securities sold are generally received over short
    periods such that the estimated fair value approximates carrying
    value. In light of recent market conditions, the Company has
    monitored the solvency position of the financial institutions
    and has determined additional adjustments are not required.

Embedded derivatives recognized in connection with ceded
    reinsurance of certain variable annuity guarantees are included
    in this caption in the consolidated financial statements but
    excluded from this caption in the preceding table as they are
    separately presented. The estimated fair value of these embedded
    derivatives is described in the section labeled “Embedded
    Derivatives within Asset and Liability Host Contracts”
    which follows.

Other Assets

— Other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheets are principally comprised of prepaid expenses,
    amounts held under corporate owned life insurance, fixed assets,
    capitalized software, deferred sales inducements, VODA, VOCRA
    and a receivable for cash paid to an unaffiliated financial
    institution under the MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston
    (“MRC”) collateral financing arrangement as described
    in Note 12. With

F-91


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the exception of the receivable for cash paid to the
    unaffiliated financial institution, other assets are not
    considered financial instruments subject to disclosure.
    Accordingly, the amount presented in the preceding table
    represents the receivable for the cash paid to the unaffiliated
    financial institution under the MRC collateral financing
    arrangement for which the estimated fair value was determined by
    discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate
    that reflects the credit of the unaffiliated financial
    institution.

Separate Account Assets —

Separate account
    assets are carried at estimated fair value and reported as a
    summarized total on the consolidated balance sheets. The
    estimated fair value of separate account assets are based on the
    estimated fair value of the underlying assets owned by the
    separate account. Assets within the Company’s separate
    accounts include: mutual funds, fixed maturity securities,
    equity securities, mortgage loans, derivatives, hedge funds,
    other limited partnership interests, short-term investments and
    cash and cash equivalents. The estimated fair value of mutual
    funds is based upon quoted prices or reported NAVs provided by
    the fund manager. Accounting guidance effective for
    December 31, 2009 clarified how investments that use NAV as
    a practical expedient for their fair value measurement are
    classified in the fair value hierarchy. As a result, the Company
    has included certain mutual funds in the amount of
    $96.2 billion in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy
    which were previously included in Level 1. The estimated
    fair values of fixed maturity securities, equity securities,
    derivatives, short-term investments and cash and cash
    equivalents held by separate accounts are determined on a basis
    consistent with the methodologies described herein for similar
    financial instruments held within the general account. The
    estimated fair value of hedge funds is based upon NAVs provided
    by the fund manager. The estimated fair value of mortgage loans
    is determined by discounting expected future cash flows, using
    current interest rates for similar loans with similar credit
    risk. Other limited partnership interests are valued giving
    consideration to the value of the underlying holdings of the
    partnerships and by applying a premium or discount, if
    appropriate, for factors such as liquidity, bid/ask spreads, the
    performance record of the fund manager or other relevant
    variables which may impact the exit value of the particular
    partnership interest.

Policyholder Account Balances

— Policyholder
    account balances in the table above include investment
    contracts. Embedded derivatives on investment contracts and
    certain variable annuity guarantees accounted for as embedded
    derivatives are included in this caption in the consolidated
    financial statements but excluded from this caption in the
    tables above as they are separately presented therein. The
    remaining difference between the amounts reflected as
    policyholder account balances in the preceding table and those
    recognized in the consolidated balance sheets represents those
    amounts due under contracts that satisfy the definition of
    insurance contracts and are not considered financial instruments.

The investment contracts primarily include certain funding
    agreements, fixed deferred annuities, modified guaranteed
    annuities, fixed term payout annuities and total control
    accounts. The fair values for these investment contracts are
    estimated by discounting best estimate future cash flows using
    current market risk-free interest rates and adding a spread for
    the Company’s own credit which is determined using publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt, as
    well as its claims paying ability.

Bank Deposits

— Due to frequency of interest
    rate resets on customer bank deposits held in money market
    accounts, the Company believes that there is minimal risk of a
    material change in interest rates such that the estimated fair
    value approximates carrying value. For time deposits, estimated
    fair values are estimated by discounting the expected cash flows
    to maturity using a discount rate based on an average market
    rate for certificates of deposit being offered by a
    representative group of large financial institutions at the date
    of the valuation.

Short-term and Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing
    Arrangements and Junior Subordinated Debt
    Securities

— The estimated fair value for
    short-term debt approximates carrying value due to the
    short-term nature of these obligations. The estimated fair
    values of long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements and
    junior subordinated debt securities are generally determined by
    discounting expected future cash flows using market rates
    currently available for debt with similar remaining maturities
    and reflecting the credit risk of the Company including inputs,
    when available, from actively traded debt of the Company or
    other companies with similar types of borrowing arrangements.
    Risk-adjusted discount rates applied to the expected future cash
    flows can

F-92


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

vary significantly based upon the specific terms of each
    individual arrangement, including, but not limited to:
    subordinated rights; contractual interest rates in relation to
    current market rates; the structuring of the arrangement; and
    the nature and observability of the applicable valuation inputs.
    Use of different risk-adjusted discount rates could result in
    different estimated fair values.

The carrying value of long-term debt presented in the table
    above differs from the amounts presented in the consolidated
    balance sheets as it does not include capital leases which are
    not required to be disclosed at estimated fair value.

Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

— The estimated fair value for
    payables for collateral under securities loaned and other
    transactions approximates carrying value. The related agreements
    to loan securities are short-term in nature such that the
    Company believes there is limited risk of a material change in
    market interest rates. Additionally, because borrowers are
    cross-collateralized by the borrowed securities, the Company
    believes no additional consideration for changes in its own
    credit are necessary.

Other Liabilities

— Other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheets are principally comprised of
    freestanding derivatives with negative estimated fair values;
    securities trading liabilities; tax and litigation contingency
    liabilities; obligations for employee-related benefits; interest
    due on the Company’s debt obligations and on cash
    collateral held in relation to securities lending; dividends
    payable; amounts due for securities purchased but not yet
    settled; amounts due under assumed reinsurance contracts; and
    general operating accruals and payables.

The estimated fair value of derivatives — with
    positive and negative estimated fair values — and
    embedded derivatives within asset and liability host contracts
    are described in the sections labeled “Derivatives”
    and “Embedded Derivatives within Asset and Liability Host
    Contracts” which follow.

The remaining other amounts included in the table above reflect
    those other liabilities that satisfy the definition of financial
    instruments subject to disclosure. These items consist primarily
    of securities trading liabilities; interest and dividends
    payable; amounts due for securities purchased but not yet
    settled; and amounts payable under certain assumed reinsurance
    contracts recognized using the deposit method of accounting. The
    Company evaluates the specific terms, facts and circumstances of
    each instrument to determine the appropriate estimated fair
    values, which were not materially different from the recognized
    carrying values.

Separate Account Liabilities

— Separate account
    liabilities included in the table above represent those balances
    due to policyholders under contracts that are classified as
    investment contracts. The difference between the separate
    account liabilities reflected above and the amounts presented in
    the consolidated balance sheets represents those contracts
    classified as insurance contracts which do not satisfy the
    criteria of financial instruments for which fair value is to be
    disclosed.

Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts
    primarily represent variable annuities with no significant
    mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is
    equal to the account balance; funding agreements related to
    group life contracts; and certain contracts that provide for
    benefit funding.

Separate account liabilities, whether related to investment or
    insurance contracts, are recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheets at an equivalent summary total of the separate account
    assets. Separate account assets, which equal net deposits, net
    investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and
    losses, are fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to
    the contractholders’ liability which is reflected in
    separate account liabilities. Since separate account liabilities
    are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets
    which are recognized at estimated fair value as described above,
    the Company believes the value of those assets approximates the
    estimated fair value of the related separate account liabilities.

Derivatives —

The estimated fair value of
    derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market
    prices for exchange-traded derivatives and interest rate
    forwards to sell certain to be announced securities, or through
    the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted

F-93


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

market values are not available, is based on market standard
    valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to be
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The significant inputs to the pricing models for most

over-the-counter

derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data. Significant inputs that are observable generally include:
    interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate
    curves, credit curves and volatility. However, certain

over-the-counter

derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the
    estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data. Significant inputs that are unobservable generally
    include: independent broker quotes, credit correlation
    assumptions, references to emerging market currencies and inputs
    that are outside the observable portion of the interest rate
    curve, credit curve, volatility or other relevant market
    measure. These unobservable inputs may involve significant
    management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable,
    these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given
    the circumstances and are assumed to be consistent with what
    other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments.

The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are
    considered in determining the estimated fair value for all

over-the-counter

derivatives, and any potential credit adjustment is based on the
    net exposure by counterparty after taking into account the
    effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements. The
    Company values its derivative positions using the standard swap
    curve which includes a spread over the risk free rate. This
    credit spread is appropriate for those parties that execute
    trades at pricing levels consistent with the standard swap
    curve. As the Company and its significant derivative
    counterparties consistently execute trades at such pricing
    levels, additional credit risk adjustments are not currently
    required in the valuation process. The Company’s ability to
    consistently execute at such pricing levels is in part due to
    the netting agreements and collateral arrangements that are in
    place with all of its significant derivative counterparties. The
    evaluation of the requirement to make additional credit risk
    adjustments is performed by the Company each reporting period.

Most inputs for

over-the-counter

derivatives are mid market inputs but, in certain cases, bid
    level inputs are used when they are deemed more representative
    of exit value. Market liquidity, as well as the use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs, may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair values of the Company’s
    derivatives and could materially affect net income.

Embedded Derivatives within Asset and Liability Host
    Contracts

— Embedded derivatives principally
    include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity
    guarantees and certain funding agreements with equity or bond
    indexed crediting rates. Embedded derivatives are recorded in
    the financial statements at estimated fair value with changes in
    estimated fair value reported in net income.

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit guarantees. GMWB, GMAB and certain
    GMIB are embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated
    fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract,
    with changes in estimated fair value reported in net investment
    gains (losses). These embedded derivatives are classified within
    policyholder account balances.

The fair value for these guarantees are estimated using the
    present value of future benefits minus the present value of
    future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions
    related to the projected cash flows over the expected lives of
    the contracts. A risk neutral valuation methodology is used
    under which the cash flows from the

F-94


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. The valuation of these
    guarantees includes an adjustment for the Company’s own
    credit and risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The
    Company’s own credit adjustment is determined taking into
    consideration publicly available information relating to the
    Company’s debt, as well as its claims paying ability. Risk
    margins are established to capture the non-capital market risks
    of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a
    market participant would require to assume the risks related to
    the uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as
    annuitization, premium persistency, partial withdrawal and
    surrenders. The establishment of risk margins requires the use
    of significant management judgment.

These guarantees may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the
    Company’s own credit standing; and variations in actuarial
    assumptions regarding policyholder behavior and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB described in the preceding paragraph. These reinsurance
    contracts contain embedded derivatives which are included in
    premiums and other receivables with changes in estimated fair
    value reported in net investment gains (losses) or policyholder
    benefit and claims depending on the statement of operations
    classification of the direct risk. The value of the embedded
    derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology
    consistent with that described previously for the guarantees
    directly written by the Company.

The estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives within
    funds withheld at interest related to certain ceded reinsurance
    is determined based on the change in estimated fair value of the
    underlying assets held by the Company in a reference portfolio
    backing the funds withheld liability. The estimated fair value
    of the underlying assets is determined as described above in
    “Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Trading
    Securities” and “Short-term Investments.” The
    estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives is included,
    along with their funds withheld hosts, in other liabilities with
    changes in estimated fair value recorded in net investment gains
    (losses). Changes in the credit spreads on the underlying
    assets, interest rates and market volatility may result in
    significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these
    embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain funding agreements is
    determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for the
    Company’s own credit that takes into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt, as
    well as its claims paying ability. The estimated fair value of
    these embedded derivatives are included, along with their
    funding agreements host, within policyholder account balances
    with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net investment
    gains (losses). Changes in equity and bond indices, interest
    rates and the Company’s credit standing may result in
    significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these
    embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income.

Assets and Liabilities of Subsidiaries

Held-For-Sale

—
    The carrying value of the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries

held-for-sale

reflects those assets and liabilities which were previously
    determined to be financial instruments and which were reflected
    in other financial statement captions in the table above in
    previous periods but have been reclassified to this caption to
    reflect the discontinued nature of the operations. The estimated
    fair value of the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries

held-for-sale

have been determined on a basis consistent with the asset type
    as described herein.

Mortgage Loan Commitments and Commitments to Fund Bank
    Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private Corporate Bond
    Investments —

The estimated fair values for
    mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund bank credit
    facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments
    reflected in the above table represent the difference between
    the discounted expected future cash flows using interest rates
    that incorporate current credit risk for similar instruments on
    the reporting date and the principal amounts of the original
    commitments.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities into the
    three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the priority of the
    inputs to the respective valuation technique. The following
    summarizes the types of assets and liabilities included within
    the three-level fair value hierarchy presented in the preceding
    table.

Level 1

This category includes certain U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed fixed maturity securities, certain foreign
    government fixed maturity securities; exchange-traded common
    stock; certain trading securities; and certain short-term money
    market securities. As it relates to derivatives, this level
    includes exchange-traded equity and interest rate futures, as
    well as interest rate forwards to sell certain to be announced
    securities. Separate account assets classified within this level
    are similar in nature to those classified in this level for the
    general account.

Level 2

This category includes fixed maturity and equity securities
    priced principally by independent pricing services using
    observable inputs. Fixed maturity securities classified as
    Level 2 include most U.S. Treasury, agency and
    government guaranteed securities, as well as the majority of
    U.S. and foreign corporate securities, RMBS, CMBS, state
    and political subdivision securities, foreign government
    securities and ABS. Equity securities classified as Level 2
    securities consist principally of common stock and
    non-redeemable preferred stock where market quotes are available
    but are not considered actively traded. Short-term investments
    and trading securities included within Level 2 are of a
    similar nature to these fixed maturity and equity securities.
    Mortgage loans included in Level 2 include residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

for which there is readily available observable pricing for
    similar loans or securities backed by similar loans and the
    unobservable adjustments to such prices are insignificant. As it
    relates to derivatives, this level includes all types of
    derivative instruments utilized by the Company with the
    exception of exchange-traded futures and interest rate forwards
    to sell certain to be announced securities included within
    Level 1 and those derivative instruments with unobservable
    inputs as described in Level 3. Separate account assets
    classified within this level are generally similar to those
    classified within this level for the general account, with the
    exception of certain mutual funds without readily determinable
    fair values given prices are not published publicly. Hedge funds
    and mutual funds owned by separate accounts are also included
    within this level. Embedded derivatives classified within this
    level include embedded equity derivatives contained in certain
    funding agreements.

Level 3

This category includes fixed maturity securities priced
    principally through independent broker quotations or market
    standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are not
    market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. This level primarily
    consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very
    limited trading activity or where

F-98


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation methodologies including: U.S. and foreign
    corporate securities — including below investment
    grade private placements; RMBS and ABS — including all
    of those supported by

sub-prime

mortgage loans. Equity securities classified as Level 3
    securities consist principally of non-redeemable preferred stock
    and common stock of companies that are privately held or of
    companies for which there has been very limited trading activity
    or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation. Short-term investments and trading securities
    included within Level 3 are of a similar nature to these
    fixed maturity and equity securities. Mortgage loans included in
    Level 3 include residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

for which pricing for similar loans or securities backed by
    similar loans is not observable and the estimated fair value is
    determined using unobservable independent broker quotations. As
    it relates to derivatives this category includes: swap
    spreadlocks with maturities which extend beyond observable
    periods; interest rate forwards including interest rate lock
    commitments with certain unobservable inputs, including
    pull-through rates; equity variance swaps with unobservable
    volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker
    quotations; foreign currency swaps which are cancelable and
    priced through independent broker quotations; interest rate
    swaps with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion
    of the yield curve; credit default swaps based upon baskets of
    credits having unobservable credit correlations, as well as
    credit default swaps with maturities which extend beyond the
    observable portion of the credit curves and credit default swaps
    priced through independent broker quotations; foreign currency
    forwards priced via independent broker quotations or with
    liquidity adjustments; interest rate caps and floors referencing
    unobservable yield curves

and/or

which
    include liquidity and volatility adjustments; implied volatility
    swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; currency options
    based upon baskets of currencies having unobservable currency
    correlations; credit forwards having unobservable repurchase
    rates; and equity options with unobservable volatility inputs.
    Separate account assets classified within this level are
    generally similar to those classified within this level for the
    general account; however, they also include mortgage loans, and
    other limited partnership interests. Embedded derivatives
    classified within this level primarily include embedded
    derivatives associated with certain variable annuity guarantees.
    This category also includes MSRs which are carried at estimated
    fair value and have multiple significant unobservable inputs
    including discount rates, estimates of loan prepayments and
    servicing costs.

Mortgage Loans —

The impaired mortgage loans
    presented above were written down to their estimated fair values
    at the date the impairments were recognized. Estimated fair
    values for impaired mortgage loans are based on observable
    market prices or, if the loans are in foreclosure or are
    otherwise determined to be collateral dependent, on the
    estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, or the
    present value of the expected future cash flows. Impairments to
    estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair value
    measurements that have been categorized as Level 3 due to
    the lack of price transparency inherent in the limited markets
    for such mortgage loans.

(2)

Other Limited Partnership Interests —

The
    impaired investments presented above were accounted for using
    the cost basis. Impairments on these cost basis investments were
    recognized at estimated fair value determined from information
    provided in the financial statements of the underlying entities
    in the period in which the impairment was incurred. These
    impairments to estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair
    value measurements that have been classified as Level 3 due
    to the limited activity and price transparency inherent in the
    market for such investments. This category includes several
    private equity and debt funds that typically invest primarily in
    a diversified pool of investments across certain investment
    strategies including domestic and international leveraged buyout
    funds; power, energy, timber and infrastructure development

funds; venture capital funds; below investment grade debt and
    mezzanine debt funds. The estimated fair values of these
    investments have been determined using the NAV of the
    Company’s ownership interest in the partners’ capital.
    Distributions from these investments will be generated from
    investment gains, from operating income from the underlying
    investments of the funds and from liquidation of the underlying
    assets of the funds. It is estimated that the underlying assets
    of the funds will be liquidated over the next 2 to
    10 years. Unfunded commitments for these investments were
    $354 million as of December 31, 2009.

Real Estate Joint Ventures —

The impaired
    investments presented above were accounted for using the cost
    basis. Impairments on these cost basis investments were
    recognized at estimated fair value determined from information
    provided in the financial statements of the underlying entities
    in the period in which the impairment was incurred. These
    impairments to estimated fair value represent non-recurring fair
    value measurements that have been classified as Level 3 due
    to the limited activity and price transparency inherent in the
    market for such investments. This category includes several real
    estate funds that typically invest primarily in commercial real
    estate. The estimated fair values of these investments have been
    determined using the NAV of the Company’s ownership
    interest in the partners’ capital. Distributions from these
    investments will be generated from investment gains, from
    operating income from the underlying investments of the funds
    and from liquidation of the underlying assets of the funds. It
    is estimated that the underlying assets of the funds will be
    liquidated over the next 2 to 10 years. Unfunded
    commitments for these investments were $86 million as of
    December 31, 2009.

    gains and losses and to other expenses for the amount of gross
    margins or profits originating from transactions other than
    investment gains and losses. Unrealized investment gains and

As described in more detail in Note 1, the Company
    performed its annual goodwill impairment tests during the third
    quarter of 2009 based upon data at June 30, 2009 that
    indicated that goodwill was not impaired. During the fourth
    quarter of 2009, the Company realigned its reportable segments.
    See Notes 1 and 22. The 2009 annual goodwill impairment
    tests were based on the segment structure in existence prior to
    such realignment. The realignment did not significantly change
    the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes and
    management concluded that no additional tests were required at
    December 31, 2009.

Previously, due to economic conditions, the sustained low level
    of equity markets, declining market capitalizations in the
    insurance industry and lower operating earnings projections,
    particularly in individual annuity and variable &
    universal life reporting units, management performed an interim
    goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2008 and again,
    for certain reporting units most affected by the current
    economic environment at March 31, 2009. Based upon the
    tests performed, management concluded no impairment of goodwill
    had occurred for any of the Company’s reporting units at
    March 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Continued deteriorating or adverse market conditions for
    certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the
    estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result
    in future impairments of goodwill.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories
    of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling
    $121.4 billion and $96.6 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, for which the policyholder assumes
    all investment risk, and separate accounts with a minimum return
    or account value for which the Company contractually guarantees
    either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder
    which totaled $27.6 billion and $24.2 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The latter
    category consisted primarily of funding agreements and
    participating close-out contracts. The average interest rate
    credited on these contracts was 3.35% and 4.40% at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company (including
    mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender
    charges) are reflected in the Company’s revenues as
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and
    totaled $2.6 billion, $3.2 billion and
    $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company’s proportional interest in separate accounts is

Obligations
    Under Funding Agreements

The Company issues fixed and floating rate funding agreements,
    which are denominated in either U.S. Dollars or foreign
    currencies, to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for
    which payment of interest and principal is secured by such
    funding agreements. During the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company issued $4.3 billion,
    $5.8 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and
    repaid $7.7 billion, $8.3 billion and
    $4.3 billion, respectively, of such funding agreements. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, funding agreements outstanding,
    which are included in policyholder account balances, were
    $19.3 billion and $21.6 billion, respectively. During
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest
    credited on the funding agreements, which are included in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances, was
    $0.6 billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion,
    respectively.

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”) is a
    member of the FHLB of Boston and holds $70 million of
    common stock of the FHLB of Boston at both December 31,
    2009 and 2008, which is included in

F-112


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

equity securities. MICC has also entered into funding agreements
    with the FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has issued such funding
    agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of Boston
    has been granted a blanket lien on certain MICC assets,
    including RMBS, to collateralize MICC’s obligations under
    the funding agreements. MICC maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MICC’s liability to
    the FHLB of Boston. The amount of MICC’s liability for
    funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was $326 million
    and $526 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. In addition, at December 31, 2008, MICC had
    advances of $300 million from the FHLB of Boston with
    original maturities of less than one year and therefore, such
    advances are included in short-term debt. There were no such
    advances at December 31, 2009. These advances and the
    advances on these funding agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $419 million and $1,284 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest credited on the
    funding agreements, which are included in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, was $6 million,
    $15 million and $34 million, respectively.

MLIC is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds $742 million
    and $830 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included
    in equity securities. MLIC has also entered into funding
    agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MLIC has issued such
    funding agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB
    of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC assets, including
    RMBS to collateralize MLIC’s obligations under the funding
    agreements. MLIC maintains control over these pledged assets,
    and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of
    the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the
    remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the
    collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC,
    the FHLB of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to
    the amount of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The
    amount of the Company’s liability for funding agreements
    with the FHLB of NY was $13.7 billion and
    $15.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. The advances on these agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $15.1 billion and $17.8 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, interest credited on the
    funding agreements, which are included in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, was $333 million,
    $229 million and $94 million, respectively.

The temporary contingent increase in MLIC’s borrowing
    capacity that was in effect on December 31, 2008 expired
    December 31, 2009.

MLIC has issued funding agreements to certain SPEs that have
    issued debt securities for which payment of interest and
    principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt
    securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and
    principal by the Farmer MAC, a federally chartered
    instrumentality of the United States. The obligations under
    these funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain
    eligible agricultural real estate mortgage loans and may, under
    certain circumstances, be secured by other qualified collateral.
    The amount of the Company’s liability for funding
    agreements issued to such trusts was $2.5 billion at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, which is included in
    policyholder account balances. The obligations under these
    funding agreements are collateralized by designated agricultural
    real estate mortgage loans with estimated fair values of
    $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2009 and 2008.
    During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    interest credited on the funding agreements, which are included
    in interest credited to policyholder account balances, was
    $132 million, $132 million and $117 million,

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, as a result of changes in estimates
    of insured events in the respective prior year, claims and claim
    adjustment expenses associated with prior years decreased by
    $152 million, $353 million and $325 million,
    respectively, due to a reduction in prior year automobile bodily
    injury and homeowners’ severity, reduced loss adjustment
    expenses, improved loss ratio for non-medical health claim
    liabilities and improved claim management.

Guarantees

The Company issues annuity contracts which may include
    contractual guarantees to the contractholder for:
    (i) return of no less than total deposits made to the
    contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
    deposits”); and (ii) the highest contract value on a
    specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following the
    contract anniversary, or total deposits made to the contract
    less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
    (“anniversary contract value” or “minimum
    return”). The Company also issues annuity contracts that
    apply a lower rate of funds deposited if the contractholder
    elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if
    the contractholder elects to annuitize (“two tier
    annuities”). These guarantees include benefits that are
    payable in the event of death or at annuitization.

The Company also issues universal and variable life contracts
    where the Company contractually guarantees to the contractholder
    a secondary guarantee or a guaranteed

paid-up

benefit.

Reinsurance

The Company’s Insurance Products segment participates in
    reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize
    exposure to significant risks and provide additional capacity
    for future growth.

For its individual life insurance products, the Company has
    historically reinsured the mortality risk primarily on an excess
    of retention basis or a quota share basis. Until 2005, the
    Company reinsured up to 90% of the mortality risk for all new
    individual life insurance policies that it wrote through its
    various subsidiaries. During 2005, the Company changed its
    retention practices for certain individual life insurance
    policies. Under the new retention guidelines, the Company
    reinsures up to 90% of the mortality risk in excess of
    $1 million. Retention limits remain unchanged for other new
    individual life insurance policies. Policies reinsured in years
    prior to 2005 remain reinsured under the original reinsurance
    agreements. On a case by case basis, the Company may retain up
    to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of amounts in
    excess of the Company’s retention limits. The Company
    evaluates its reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or
    decrease its retention at any time. Placement of reinsurance is
    done primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative
    basis for risks with specific characteristics. In addition to
    reinsuring mortality risk as described above, the Company
    reinsures other risks, as well as specific coverages. The
    Company routinely reinsures certain classes of risks in order to
    limit its exposure to particular travel, avocation and lifestyle
    hazards.

For other policies within the Insurance Products segment, the
    Company generally retains most of the risk and only cedes
    particular risks on certain client arrangements.

The Company’s Retirement Products segment reinsures a
    portion of the living and death benefit guarantees issued in
    connection with its variable annuities. Under these reinsurance
    agreements, the Company pays a reinsurance premium generally
    based on fees associated with the guarantees collected from
    policyholders, and receives reimbursement for benefits paid or
    accrued in excess of account values, subject to certain
    limitations. The Company enters into similar agreements for new
    or in-force business depending on market conditions.

The Company’s International and Corporate Benefit Funding
    segments have periodically engaged in reinsurance activities, as
    considered appropriate. The impact of these activities on the
    financial results of these segments has not been significant.

The Company’s Auto & Home segment purchases
    reinsurance to manage its exposure to large losses (primarily
    catastrophe losses) and to protect statutory surplus. The
    Company cedes to reinsurers a portion of losses and premiums
    based upon the exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance.
    To manage exposure to large property and casualty losses, the
    Company utilizes property catastrophe, casualty and property per
    risk excess of loss agreements.

F-117


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company also reinsures, through 100% quota share reinsurance
    agreements, certain long-term care and workers’
    compensation business written by MICC. These are run-off
    businesses which have been included within Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

The Company has exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute
    to significant fluctuations in the Company’s results of
    operations. The Company uses excess of retention and quota share
    reinsurance arrangements to provide greater diversification of
    risk and minimize exposure to larger risks.

The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group
    of reinsurers and periodically monitors collectibility of
    reinsurance balances. These reinsurance recoverable balances are
    stated net of allowances for uncollectible reinsurance, which as
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, were immaterial.

The Company analyzes recent trends in arbitration and litigation
    outcomes in disputes, if any, with its reinsurers. The Company
    monitors ratings and evaluates the financial strength of the
    Company’s reinsurers by analyzing their financial
    statements. In addition, the reinsurance recoverable balance due
    from each reinsurer is evaluated as part of the overall
    monitoring process. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable
    balances are evaluated based on these analyses.

The Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances
    with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts,
    funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company  had $4.4 billion of
    unsecured unaffiliated reinsurance recoverable balances.

At December 31, 2009, the Company had $11.7 billion of
    net unaffiliated ceded reinsurance recoverables. Of this total,
    $9.2 billion, or 79%, were with the Company’s five
    largest unaffiliated ceded reinsurers, including
    $3.0 billion of which were unsecured.

The amounts in the consolidated statements of operations include
    the impact of reinsurance. Information regarding the effect of

Closed
    Block

On April 7, 2000, (the “Demutualization Date”),
    MLIC converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock
    life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New
    York Superintendent of Insurance (the
    “Superintendent”) approving MLIC’s plan of
    reorganization, as amended (the “Plan”). On the
    Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the
    benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies
    of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an
    amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which,
    together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in
    the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to
    support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies,
    including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of
    claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the
    continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999,
    if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and
    for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and
    projected experience against the

F-119


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

experience assumed in the then-current dividend scales. Dividend
    scales are adjusted periodically to give effect to changes in
    experience.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies
    in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows
    from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and
    other experience related to the closed block are, in the
    aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the
    closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed
    block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less
    than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
    policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts
    assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed
    block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
    If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed
    policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets
    outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in
    effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains
    in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over
    100 years.

The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for
    the participating policies included in the closed block as it
    used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company
    establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that
    will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as
    described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over
    closed block assets at the effective date of the demutualization
    (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in
    accumulated other comprehensive income) represents the estimated
    maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result
    from operations attributed to the closed block after income
    taxes. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income
    over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block
    remain in-force. Management believes that over time the actual
    cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal
    the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend
    changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in
    existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block
    are greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed
    block, the Company will pay the excess of the actual cumulative
    earnings of the closed block over the expected cumulative
    earnings to closed block policyholders as additional
    policyholder dividends unless offset by future unfavorable
    experience of the closed block and, accordingly, will recognize
    only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess
    recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such
    period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block are
    less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block,
    the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income.
    However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in
    the future, which would be intended to increase future actual
    earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected
    cumulative earnings.

Recent experience within the closed block, in particular
    mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and
    unrealized losses, have resulted in a policyholder dividend
    obligation of zero at both December 31, 2009 and 2008. The
    policyholder dividend obligation of zero and the Company’s
    decision to revise the expected policyholder dividend scales,
    which are based upon statutory results, have resulted in a
    reduction to both actual and expected cumulative earnings of the
    closed block. Amortization of the closed block DAC, which
    resides outside of the closed block, will be based upon actual
    cumulative earnings rather than expected cumulative earnings of
    the closed block until such time as the actual cumulative
    earnings of the closed block exceed the expected cumulative
    earnings, at which time the policyholder dividend obligation
    will be reestablished. Actual cumulative earnings less than
    expected cumulative earnings will result in future adjustments
    to DAC and net income of the Company and increase sensitivity of
    the Company’s net income to movements in closed block
    results.

The closed block adjustment represents an intra-company

MLIC charges the closed block with federal income taxes, state
    and local premium taxes and other additive state or local taxes,
    as well as investment management expenses relating to the closed

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt at December 31,
    2009 for the next five years are $431 million in 2010,
    $1,358 million in 2011, $1,506 million in 2012,
    $718 million in 2013, $416 million in 2014 and
    $8,789 million thereafter.

Repurchase agreements and capital lease obligations are
    collateralized and rank highest in priority, followed by
    unsecured senior debt which consists of senior notes, fixed rate
    notes and other notes with varying interest rates, followed by
    subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated debt
    securities. Payments of interest and principal on the
    Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other
    obligations at the operating company level and senior to
    obligations at the Holding Company, may be made only with the
    prior approval of the insurance department of the state of
    domicile. Collateral financing arrangements are supported by
    either surplus notes of subsidiaries or financing arrangements
    with the Holding Company and accordingly have priority
    consistent with other such obligations.

Certain of the Company’s debt instruments, credit
    facilities and committed facilities contain various
    administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. The
    Company believes it was in compliance with all covenants at both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Senior
    Notes

In May 2009, the Holding Company issued $1,250 million of
    senior notes due June 1, 2016. The notes bear interest at a
    fixed rate of 6.75%, payable semiannually. In connection with
    the offering, the Holding Company incurred $6 million of
    issuance costs which have been capitalized and included in other
    assets. These costs are being amortized over the term of the
    notes.

In March 2009, the Holding Company issued $397 million of
    floating rate senior notes due June 29, 2012 under the FDIC
    Program. The notes bear interest at a rate equal to three-month
    LIBOR, reset quarterly, plus 0.32%. The notes are not redeemable
    prior to their maturity. In connection with the offering, the
    Holding Company incurred $15 million of issuance costs
    which have been capitalized and included in other assets. These
    costs are being amortized over the term of the notes.

In February 2009, the Holding Company remarketed its existing
    $1,035 million 4.91% Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities as 7.717% senior debt securities, Series B,
    due 2019. In August 2008, the Holding Company remarketed its
    existing $1,035 million 4.82% Series A junior
    subordinated debt securities as 6.817% senior debt
    securities, Series A, due 2018. Interest on both series of
    debt securities is payable

Repurchase
    Agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of New
    York

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and held
    $124 million and $89 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also
    entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for
    cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket
    lien on certain of MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages,
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the
    repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase
    agreements and the related security agreement represented by
    this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by
    MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the
    amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding
    repurchase agreements. The amount of MetLife Bank’s
    liability for repurchase agreements entered into with the FHLB
    of NY was $2.4 billion and $1.8 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt and short-term debt depending upon the
    original tenor of the advance. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, MetLife Bank received
    advances related to long-term borrowings totaling
    $1,280 million, $220 million and $390 million,
    respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank made repayments
    to the FHLB of NY of $497 million, $371 million and
    $175 million related to long-term borrowings for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    advances on the repurchase agreements related to both long-term
    and short-term debt were collateralized by residential
    mortgages, mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities with
    estimated fair values of $5.5 billion and $3.1 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Collateralized
    Borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York

MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing
    privileges and participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York Term Auction Facility. In order to utilize these
    facilities, MetLife Bank has pledged qualifying loans and
    investment securities to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as
    collateral. At December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank’s
    liability for advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    under these facilities was $950 million, which is included
    in short-term debt. MetLife Bank had no liability for advances
    from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under these facilities
    at December 31, 2009. The estimated fair value of loan and
    investment security collateral pledged by MetLife Bank to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York at December 31, 2009 and
    2008 was $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.
    During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    weighted average interest rate on these advances was 0.26% and
    0.79%, respectively. During the years ended December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, the average daily balance of these
    advances was $1,513 million and $145 million and these
    advances were outstanding for an average of 24 days and
    41 days. The Company did not participate in these programs
    during 2007.

Collateral
    Financing Arrangements

Associated
    with the Closed Block

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MRC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In
    connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors
    placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,
    $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of

35-year

surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the
    assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make
    interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is
    contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval. At both
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of the surplus notes
    outstanding was $2.5 billion.

Simultaneous with the issuance of the surplus notes, the Holding
    Company entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated
    financial institution, under which the Holding Company is
    entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below. The Holding Company may also be required to
    pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution related to any decline in the estimated fair value

F-126


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

of the surplus notes. Any such payments would be accounted for
    as a receivable and included in other assets on the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets and would not reduce
    the principal amount outstanding of the surplus notes. Such
    payments would, however, reduce the amount of interest payments
    due from the Holding Company under the agreement. Any payment
    received from the unaffiliated financial institution would
    reduce the receivable by an amount equal to such payment and
    would also increase the amount of interest payments due from the
    Holding Company under the agreement. In addition, the
    unaffiliated financial institution may be required to pledge
    collateral to the Holding Company related to any increase in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. During 2008, the
    Holding Company paid an aggregate of $800 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution relating to declines in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. The Holding Company
    did not receive any payments from the unaffiliated financial
    institution during 2008. During 2009, on a net basis, the
    Holding Company received $375 million from the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to changes in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. No payments were made or received by
    the Holding Company during 2007. Since the closing of the
    collateral financing arrangement in December 2007, on a net
    basis, the Holding Company has paid $425 million to the
    unaffiliated financial institution related to changes in the
    estimated fair value of the surplus notes. In addition, at
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company had pledged
    collateral with an estimated fair value of $230 million to
    the unaffiliated financial institution. At December 31,
    2009, the Holding Company had no collateral pledged to the
    unaffiliated financial institution in connection with this
    agreement. The Holding Company may also be required to make a
    payment to the unaffiliated financial institution in connection
    with any early termination of this agreement.

A majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus
    notes was placed in a trust, which is consolidated by the
    Company, to support MRC’s statutory obligations associated
    with the assumed closed block liabilities. During 2007, MRC
    deposited $2.0 billion into the trust, from the proceeds of
    the surplus notes issued in 2007. During 2008, MRC deposited an
    additional $314 million into the trust. No amounts were
    deposited into the trust during 2009. At December 31, 2009
    and 2008, the estimated fair value of assets held in trust by
    the Company was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion,
    respectively. The assets are principally invested in fixed
    maturity securities and are presented as such within the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with the related
    income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest
    on the collateral financing arrangement is included as a
    component of other expenses.

Total interest expense related to the collateral financing
    arrangement was $51 million, $117 million and
    $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

Associated
    with Secondary Guarantees

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MRSC, a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of the Company, entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, $2.8 billion and
    $2.7 billion, respectively, had been drawn upon under the
    collateral financing arrangement. The collateral financing
    arrangement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing.

Proceeds from the collateral financing arrangement were placed
    in trusts to support MRSC’s statutory obligations
    associated with the reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The
    trusts are VIEs which are consolidated by the Company. The
    unaffiliated financial institution is entitled to the return on
    the investment portfolio held by the trusts. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company held assets in
    trust with an estimated fair value of $3.2 billion and
    $2.4 billion, respectively, associated with the collateral
    financing arrangement. The assets are principally invested in
    fixed maturity securities and are presented as such within the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets, with the related
    income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Interest
    on the collateral financing arrangement is included as a
    component of other expenses.

MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In connection with the collateral financing arrangement, the
    Holding Company entered into an agreement with the same
    unaffiliated financial institution under which the Holding
    Company is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio
    held by the trusts established in connection with this
    collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of
    a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may
    also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trusts, related to any decline
    in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trusts, as
    well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination
    of the collateral financing arrangement. During 2009 and 2008,
    the Holding Company contributed $360 million and
    $320 million, respectively, as a result of declines in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in the trusts. Cumulatively
    since May 2007, the Holding Company has contributed a total of
    $680 million as a result of declines in the estimated fair
    value of the assets in the trusts, all of which was deposited
    into the trusts.

In addition, the Holding Company may be required to pledge
    collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this
    agreement. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Holding
    Company had pledged $80 million and $86 million,
    respectively, under the agreement.

Transaction costs associated with the collateral financing
    arrangement of $5 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and are being amortized over the
    period from May 2007, the date the Holding Company entered into
    the collateral financing arrangement, to its expiration. Total
    interest expense related to the collateral financing arrangement
    was $44 million, $107 million and $84 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities

Junior
    Subordinated Debt Securities Underlying Common Equity
    Units

In June 2005, the Holding Company issued $1,067 million
    4.82% Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B
    junior subordinated debt securities due no later than
    February 15, 2039 and February 15, 2040, respectively,
    for a total of $2,134 million, in exchange for
    $64 million in trust common securities of MetLife Capital
    Trust II (“Series A Trust”) and MetLife
    Capital Trust III (“Series B Trust”) and
    together with the Series A Trust, (the “Capital
    Trusts”), both subsidiary trusts of MetLife, Inc., and
    $2,070 million in aggregate cash proceeds from the sale by
    the subsidiary trusts of trust preferred securities,
    constituting part of the common equity units. The subsidiary
    trusts each issued $1,035 million of trust preferred
    securities and $32 million of trust common securities.

In August 2008, the Series A Trust was dissolved and
    $32 million of the Series A junior subordinated debt
    securities were returned to the Holding Company concurrently
    with the cancellation of the $32 million of trust common
    securities of the Series A Trust held by MetLife, Inc. Upon
    dissolution of the Series A Trust, the remaining
    $1,035 million of Series A junior subordinated debt
    securities were distributed to the holders of the trust
    preferred securities and such trust preferred securities were
    cancelled. In connection with the remarketing transaction on
    August 15, 2008, the remaining $1,035 million of
    MetLife, Inc. Series A junior subordinated debt securities
    were modified, as permitted by their terms, to be
    6.817% senior debt securities, Series A, due
    August 15, 2018. The Company did not receive any proceeds
    from the remarketing. See also Notes 11, 14 and 18.

In February 2009, the Series B Trust was dissolved and
    $32 million of the Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities were returned to the Holding Company concurrently
    with the cancellation of the $32 million of trust common
    securities of the Series B Trust held by MetLife, Inc. Upon
    dissolution of the Series B Trust, the remaining
    $1,035 million of Series B junior subordinated debt
    securities were distributed to the holders of the trust
    preferred securities and such trust preferred securities were
    cancelled. In connection with the remarketing transaction on
    February 17, 2009, the remaining $1,035 million of

    requirement to, defer interest payments on the securities for a
    period up to ten years. Interest compounds during such periods
    of deferral. If interest is deferred for more than five
    consecutive years, the Holding Company is required to use
    proceeds from the sale of its common stock or warrants on common
    stock to satisfy interest payment obligation. In connection with
    each of the securities described above, the Holding Company
    entered into a replacement capital covenant (“RCC”).
    As part of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not
    repay, redeem, or purchase the securities on or before a date
    ten years prior to the final maturity date of each issuance,
    unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds
    during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the securities due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the securities and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of the Holding
    Company’s indebtedness (which will initially be its
    5.70% senior notes due June 2035). The Holding Company also
    entered into a replacement capital obligation which will
    commence during the six month period prior to the scheduled
    redemption date and under which the Holding Company must use
    reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital to
    permit repayment of the securities through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities.

Issuance costs associated with the issuance of the securities of
    $5 million, $8 million and $10 million were
    incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. These issuance costs have been capitalized,
    are included in other assets, and are amortized over the period
    from the issuance date until the scheduled redemption date of
    the respective issuances. Interest expense on other junior
    subordinated debt securities was $231 million,

Common
    Equity Units

In connection with financing the acquisition of The Travelers
    Insurance Company on July 1, 2005, the Holding Company
    distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375% common equity
    units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a registered public
    offering on June 21, 2005. The common equity units
    consisted of interests in trust preferred securities issued by
    MetLife Capital Trusts II and III, and stock purchase
    contracts issued by the Holding Company. The only assets of
    MetLife Capital Trusts II and III were junior
    subordinated debt securities issued by the Holding Company. The
    common equity units ceased to exist upon the closing of the
    remarketing of the underlying debt instruments and the
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts in August 2008 and
    February 2009. See Notes 13 and 18.

capital loss carryforwards amount to $1,525 million at
    December 31, 2009 and will expire beginning in 2010.
    Foreign capital loss carryforwards amount to $51 million at
    December 31, 2009 and will expire beginning in 2014. Tax
    credit carryforwards amount to $401 million at
    December 31, 2009.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to tax
    benefits of certain foreign net operating and capital loss
    carryforwards and certain foreign unrealized losses. The
    valuation allowance reflects management’s assessment, based
    on available information, that it is more likely than not that
    the deferred income tax asset for certain foreign net operating
    and capital loss carryforwards and certain foreign unrealized
    losses will not be realized. The tax benefit will be recognized
    when management believes that it is more likely than not that
    these deferred income tax assets are realizable. In 2009, the
    Company recorded an overall decrease to the deferred tax
    valuation allowance of $55 million, comprised of a decrease
    of $80 million related to certain foreign unrealized
    losses, an increase of $13 million related to certain
    foreign capital loss carryforwards and an increase of
    $12 million related to certain foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards.

The Company has not established a valuation allowance against
    the deferred tax asset of $816 million recognized in
    connection with unrealized losses at December 31, 2009,
    other than the $2 million of valuation allowance recognized
    in connection with certain foreign unrealized losses. A
    valuation allowance was not considered necessary based upon the
    Company’s intent and ability to hold such securities until
    their recovery or maturity and the existence of tax-planning
    strategies that include sources of future taxable income against
    which such losses could be offset.

The Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal
    government and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as
    foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    and other tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company
    has significant business operations. The income tax years under
    examination vary by jurisdiction. With a few exceptions, the
    Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
    local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for
    years prior to 2000. In early 2009, the Company and the IRS
    completed and substantially settled the audit years of 2000 to
    2002. A few issues not settled have been escalated to the next
    level, IRS Appeals. The IRS exam of the next audit cycle, years
    2003 to 2005, is expected to begin in early 2010.

The Company classifies interest accrued related to unrecognized
    tax benefits in interest expense, while penalties are included
    within income tax expense.

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $840 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $565 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $92 million from January 1, 2007 primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, post-sale purchase
    price adjustments and reinsurance offset by additions for tax
    positions of the current year. As a result of the settlements,
    items within the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, in the
    amount of $177 million, were reclassified to current and
    deferred income tax payable, as applicable, and a payment of
    $156 million was made in December of 2007, with
    $6 million paid in 2009 and the remaining $15 million
    to be paid in future years.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $766 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $567 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $74 million from December 31, 2007 primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, leasing and tax
    credits offset by additions for tax positions of the current
    year. As a result of the settlements, items within the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, in the amount of
    $153 million, were reclassified to current and deferred
    income tax payable, as applicable, of which $20 million was
    paid in 2008 and $133 million was paid in 2009.

At December 31, 2009, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $773 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $583 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by
    $7 million from December 31, 2008 primarily due to

F-132


MetLife,
    Inc.

    Statements — (Continued)

additions for tax positions of the current and prior years
    offset by settlements reached with the IRS. Settlements with tax
    authorities amounted to $46 million, of which
    $44 million was reclassified to current income tax payable
    and paid in 2009 and $2 million reduced current income tax
    expense.

The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    decrease in the next 12 months pending the outcome of
    remaining issues, tax-exempt income and tax credits, associated
    with the 2000 to 2002 IRS audit. A reasonable estimate of
    decrease cannot be made at this time. However, the Company
    continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of the issues
    will not result in a material change to its consolidated
    financial statements, although the resolution of income tax
    matters could impact the Company’s effective tax rate for a
    particular future period.

    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recognized $81 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had $218 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $8 million increase from January 1,
    2007 in accrued interest associated with the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an increase of
    $81 million of interest expense and a $73 million
    decrease primarily resulting from the aforementioned IRS
    settlements. The $73 million was reclassified to current
    income tax payable in 2007 and paid in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $37 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had $176 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $42 million decrease from
    December 31, 2007 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an
    increase of $37 million of interest expense and a
    $79 million decrease primarily resulting from the
    aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $79 million
    decrease, $78 million was reclassified to current income
    tax payable in 2008, with $7 million and $71 million
    paid in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The remaining
    $1 million reduced interest expense.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recognized $44 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2009, the Company had $198 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $22 million increase from
    December 31, 2008 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an
    increase of $44 million of interest expense and a
    $22 million decrease primarily resulting from the
    aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $22 million
    decrease, $20 million has been reclassified to current
    income tax payable and was paid in 2009. The remaining
    $2 million reduced interest expense.

The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS have indicated
    that they intend to address through regulations the methodology
    to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction
    (“DRD”), related to variable life insurance and
    annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income
    subject to tax and is a significant component of the difference
    between the actual tax expense and expected amount determined
    using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. Any regulations
    that the IRS ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will
    be subject to public notice and comment, at which time insurance
    companies and other interested parties will have the opportunity
    to raise legal and practical questions about the content, scope
    and application of such regulations. As a result, the ultimate
    timing and substance of any such regulations are unknown at this
    time. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
    Company recognized an income tax benefit of $216 million
    and $179 million, respectively, related to the separate
    account DRD. The 2009 benefit included a benefit of
    $33 million related to a

Contingencies,
    Commitments and Guarantees

Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. In 2007, the Company received $39 million upon
    the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the
    2000 acquisition of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”), and the Company reduced legal liabilities
    by $38 million after the settlement of certain cases. The
    review includes senior legal and financial personnel. Unless
    stated below, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are established when
    it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of the matters noted below. In 2009,
    the Company increased legal liabilities for litigation matters
    pending against the Company. It is possible that some of the
    matters could require the Company to pay damages or make other
    expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be
    estimated at December 31, 2009.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups
    of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs— it had no special relationship
    with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute
    or sell the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs;
    (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of MLIC;
    (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the cause of the
    plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure
    occurred after the dangers of asbestos were known; and
    (v) the applicable time with respect to filing suit has
    expired. During the course of the litigation, certain trial
    courts have granted motions dismissing claims against MLIC,
    while other trial courts have denied MLIC’s motions to
    dismiss. There can be no assurance that MLIC will receive
    favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases
    brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to continue to defend
    aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure,
    including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.

In 2006, MLIC received approximately 7,870 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 87,070 claims, and paid
    approximately $35.5 million for settlements reached in 2006
    and prior years. In 2005, MLIC received approximately 18,500 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 100,250
    claims, and paid approximately $74.3 million for
    settlements reached in 2005 and prior years. In 2004, MLIC
    received approximately 23,900 new claims, ending the year with a
    total of approximately 108,000 claims, and paid approximately
    $85.5 million for settlements reached in 2004 and prior
    years. In 2003, MLIC received approximately 58,750 new claims,
    ending the year with a total of approximately 111,700 claims,
    and paid

F-135


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

approximately $84.2 million for settlements reached in 2003
    and prior years. The number of asbestos cases that may be
    brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may
    incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given
    year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the
    dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of
    any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provided for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion in excess of a
    $400 million self-insured retention. The Company’s
    initial option to commute the excess insurance policies for
    asbestos-related claims would have arisen at the end of 2008. On
    September 29, 2008, MLIC entered into agreements commuting
    the excess insurance policies at September 30, 2008. As a
    result of the commutation of the policies, MLIC received cash
    and securities totaling $632 million. Of this total, MLIC
    received $115 million in fixed maturity securities on
    September 26, 2008, $200 million in cash on
    October 29, 2008, and $317 million in cash on
    January 29, 2009. MLIC recognized a loss on commutation of
    the policies in the amount of $35.3 million during 2008.

In the years prior to commutation, the excess insurance policies
    for asbestos-related claims were subject to annual and per claim
    sublimits. Amounts exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were approximately $16 million, $8 million and
    $0, respectively. Amounts were recoverable under the policies
    annually with respect to claims paid during the prior calendar
    year. Each asbestos-related policy contained an experience fund
    and a reference fund that provided for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund was greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund was less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund was tied to performance of the
    S&P 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
    A claim with respect to the prior year was made under the excess
    insurance policies in each year from 2003 through 2008 for the
    amounts paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of
    the retention. The foregone loss reimbursements were
    approximately $62.2 million with respect to claims for the
    period of 2002 through 2007. Because the policies were commuted
    at September 30, 2008, there will be no claims under the
    policies or forgone loss reimbursements with respect to payments
    made in 2008 and thereafter.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law and its
    past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are
    reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal
    defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant
    assumptions underlying MLIC’s

F-136

    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

analysis of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect
    to asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future
    claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the
    cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its
    exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its
    liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through
    December 31, 2009.

Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    (“FINRA”) seeking a broad range of information. The
    issues involved in information requests and regulatory matters
    vary widely. Certain regulators have requested information and
    documents regarding contingent commission payments to brokers,
    the Company’s awareness of any “sham” bids for
    business, bids and quotes that the Company submitted to
    potential customers, incentive agreements entered into with
    brokers, or compensation paid to intermediaries. The Company has
    received a subpoena from and has had discussions with the Office
    of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of
    California regarding the insurance broker Universal Life
    Resources. The Florida insurance regulator has initiated
    discussions with the Company regarding its investigation of
    contingent payments made to brokers. The Massachusetts Office of
    the Attorney General has been conducting a civil investigation
    of the rating practices of motorcycle insurers in Massachusetts
    including Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company
    (“MPC”). MPC has reached an agreement with the
    Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General to resolve this
    matter by refunding premiums with interest to affected
    policyholders. The Company has been cooperating fully in these
    inquiries.

In June 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a
    Notice of Violation (“NOV”) regarding the operations
    of the Homer City Generating Station, an electrical generation
    facility. The NOV alleges, among other things, that the
    electrical generation facility is being operated in violation of
    certain federal and state Clean Air Act requirements. Homer City
    OL6 LLC, an entity owned by MLIC, is a passive investor with a
    noncontrolling interest in the electrical generation facility,
    which is solely operated by the lessee, EME Homer City
    Generation L.P. (“EME Homer”). Homer City OL6 LLC and
    EME Homer are among the respondents identified in the NOV. EME
    Homer has been notified of its obligation to indemnify Homer
    City OL6 LLC and MLIC for any claims resulting from the NOV and
    has expressly acknowledged its obligation to indemnify Homer
    City OL6 LLC.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states and FINRA
    have had investigations or inquiries relating to sales of
    individual life insurance policies or annuities or other
    products by MLIC, MICC, New England Mutual Life Insurance
    Company, New England Life Insurance Company and GALIC, and the
    four Company broker dealers, which are MetLife Securities, Inc.
    (“MSI”), New England Securities Corporation, Walnut
    Street Securities, Inc. and Tower Square Securities, Inc. Over
    the past several years, these and a number of investigations by
    other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments
    and certain other relief. The Company may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner.

MSI is a defendant in two regulatory matters brought by the
    Illinois Department of Securities. In 2005, MSI received a
    notice from the Illinois Department of Securities asserting
    possible violations of the Illinois Securities Act in connection
    with alleged failure to disclose portability with respect to
    sales of a former affiliate’s mutual funds and
    representative compensation with respect to proprietary
    products. A response has been submitted and in

F-137


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

January 2008, MSI received notice of the commencement of an
    administrative action by the Illinois Department of Securities.
    In May 2008, MSI’s motion to dismiss the action was denied.
    In the second matter, in December 2008 MSI received a Notice of
    Hearing from the Illinois Department of Securities based upon a
    complaint alleging that MSI failed to reasonably supervise one
    of its former registered representatives in connection with the
    sale of variable annuities to Illinois investors. MSI intends to
    vigorously defend against the claims in these matters.

On April 14, 2009, MSI received a Wells Notice from FINRA
    stating that FINRA was considering recommending that a
    disciplinary action be brought against MSI. FINRA contended that
    during the period from March 1999 through December 2006,
    MSI’s registered representative supervisory system was not
    reasonably designed to achieve compliance with National
    Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rules relating to the
    review of registered representatives’ electronic
    correspondence, private securities transactions and outside
    business activities. In November 2009, the Company and FINRA
    reached a settlement resolving the matter on behalf of the four
    Company broker dealers, which included payment of a penalty. The
    four Company broker dealers neither admitted nor denied
    FINRA’s findings.

Demutualization
    Actions

The Company is a defendant in two lawsuits challenging the
    fairness of the Plan and the adequacy and accuracy of
    MLIC’s disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. The
    plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class action,

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al.
    (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17, 2000)

, sought
    compensatory relief and punitive damages against MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. The court certified a
    litigation class of present and former policyholders on
    plaintiffs’ claim that defendants violated
    section 7312 of the New York Insurance Law. The plaintiffs
    in the consolidated federal court class action,

In re MetLife
    Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed April 18,
    2000)

, sought rescission and compensatory damages against
    MLIC and the Holding Company. Plaintiffs asserted violations of
    the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 (“Exchange Act”) in connection with the Plan,
    claiming that the Policyholder Information Booklets failed to
    disclose certain material facts and contained certain material
    misstatements. The court certified a litigation class of present
    and former policyholders. On November 4, and 5, 2009, the
    courts in these cases issued orders preliminarily approving a
    proposed settlement of this litigation and directing the parties
    to give notice of the proposed settlement to the class. On
    December 30, 2009 and February 9, 2010, the courts
    conducted a hearing jointly to determine the fairness of the
    proposed settlement, class counsel’s fee request, and other
    matters. On December 30, 2009, the federal court issued an
    order holding that the notice given to the class members
    concerning the proposed settlement was adequate under federal
    law. On February 12, 2010, the federal court approved the
    settlement in an order that will become effective upon the state
    court’s issuance of its order approving the settlement.

Other
    Litigation

Travelers Ins. Co., et al. v. Banc of America Securities
    LLC (S.D.N.Y., filed December 13, 2001).

On
    January 6, 2009, after a jury trial

,

the district
    court entered a judgment in favor of The Travelers Insurance
    Company, now known as MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut,
    in the amount of approximately $42 million in connection
    with securities and common law claims against the defendant. On
    May 14, 2009, the district court issued an opinion and
    order denying the defendant’s post judgment motion seeking
    a judgment in its favor or, in the alternative, a new trial. On
    June 3, 2009, the defendant filed a notice of appeal from
    the January 6, 2009 judgment and the May 14, 2009
    opinion and order. As it is possible that the judgment could be
    affected during appellate practice, and the Company has not
    collected any portion of the judgment, the Company has not
    recognized any award amount in its consolidated financial
    statements.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
    Company in Illinois. One suit claims breach of contract and

F-138


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical claims arising
    from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee pricing
    system. The second suit currently alleges breach of contract
    arising from the alleged use of preferred provider organizations
    to reduce medical provider fees covered by the medical claims
    portion of the insurance policy. Motions for class certification
    have been filed and briefed in both cases.

Simon v.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (W.D. Okla., filed
    September 23, 2008),

a third putative nationwide class
    action lawsuit relating to payment of medical providers, is
    pending in federal court in Oklahoma. The Company is vigorously
    defending against the claims in these matters.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife Inc., et
    al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19, 2003).

The
    American Dental Association and three individual providers had
    sued the Holding Company, MLIC and other non-affiliated
    insurance companies in a putative class action lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs purported to represent a nationwide class of

in-network

providers who alleged that their claims were being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleged federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. All of
    plaintiffs’ claims except for breach of contract claims
    were dismissed with prejudice on March 2, 2009. By order
    dated March 20, 2009, the district court declined to retain
    jurisdiction over the remaining breach of contract claims and
    dismissed the lawsuit. On April 17, 2009, plaintiffs filed
    a notice of appeal from this order.

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district
    class action proceeding, plaintiffs’ complaint alleged that
    the Holding Company, MLIC, several non-affiliated insurance
    companies and several insurance brokers violated the Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”), and antitrust laws and committed other
    misconduct in the context of providing insurance to employee
    benefit plans and to persons who participate in such employee
    benefit plans. In August and September 2007 and January 2008,
    the court issued orders granting defendants’ motions to
    dismiss with prejudice the federal antitrust, the RICO, and the
    ERISA claims. In February 2008, the court dismissed the
    remaining state law claims on jurisdictional grounds.
    Plaintiffs’ appeal from the orders dismissing their RICO
    and federal antitrust claims is pending with the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A putative class action
    alleging that the Holding Company and other non-affiliated
    defendants violated state laws was transferred to the District
    of New Jersey but was not consolidated with other related
    actions. Plaintiffs’ motion to remand this action to state
    court in Florida is pending.

Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Park Avenue Securities,
    et. al. (FINRA Arbitration, filed May 2006).

MLIC
    commenced an action against Park Avenue Securities LLC., a
    registered investment adviser and broker-dealer that is an
    indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance
    Company of America, alleging misappropriation of confidential
    and proprietary information and use of prohibited methods to
    solicit the Company’s customers and recruit the
    Company’s financial services representatives. On
    February 12, 2009, a FINRA arbitration panel awarded MLIC
    $21 million in damages, including punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees. In March 2009, Park Avenue Securities
    filed a motion to vacate the decision. In September 2009, the
    parties reached a settlement of this action together with
    related and similar matters brought by MLIC against Park Avenue
    Securities and The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America.

Roberts, et al. v. Tishman Speyer Properties, et al. (Sup.
    Ct., N.Y. County, filed January 22,
    2007)

.  This lawsuit was filed by a putative class
    of market rate tenants at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper
    Village against parties including Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company and Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity
    Company. These tenants claim that the Company, as former owner,
    and the current owner improperly deregulated apartments while
    receiving J-51 tax abatements. The lawsuit seeks declaratory
    relief and damages for rent overcharges. In August 2007, the
    trial court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss. In
    March 2009, New York’s intermediate appellate court
    reversed the trial court’s decision and reinstated the
    lawsuit. The defendants appealed this ruling to the New York
    State Court of Appeals, which in October 2009 issued an opinion
    affirming the ruling of the intermediate appellate court. The
    lawsuit has returned to the trial court for further proceedings
    but is temporarily

F-139


MetLife,

stayed to allow for settlement discussions between the current
    owner and plaintiffs. The Company will continue to vigorously
    defend against the claims against it in the lawsuit.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007).

A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs asserted legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs sought rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. In August 2009, the court
    granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. On
    September 29, 2009, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal
    from the court’s order dismissing the lawsuit.

Sales Practices Claims.

Over the past several
    years, the Company has faced numerous claims, including class
    action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of
    individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or
    other products. Some of the current cases seek substantial
    damages, including punitive and treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees. At December 31, 2009, there were
    approximately 130 sales practices litigation matters pending
    against the Company. The Company continues to vigorously defend
    against the claims in these matters. The Company believes
    adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial
    statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for
    sales practices matters.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its
    activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor
    and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities
    and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries
    and conduct investigations concerning the Company’s
    compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and
    regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted
    previously in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer

    Inc.

    Statements — (Continued)

engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover
    assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets.
    Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments are as
    follows:

Argentina

The Argentine economic, regulatory and legal environment,
    including interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators
    and courts, is uncertain. Potential legal or governmental
    actions related to pension reform, fiduciary responsibilities,
    performance guarantees and tax rulings could adversely affect
    the results of the Company.

In 2007, pension reform legislation in Argentina was enacted
    which relieved the Company of its obligation to provide death
    and disability policy coverages and resulted in the elimination
    of related insurance liabilities. The reform reinstituted the
    government’s pension plan system and allowed for pension
    participants to transfer their future contributions to the
    government pension plan system.

Although it no longer received compensation, the Company
    continued to be responsible for managing the funds of those
    participants that transferred to the government system. This
    change resulted in the establishment of a liability for future
    servicing obligations and the elimination of the Company’s
    obligations under death and disability policy coverages. The
    impact of the 2007 Argentine pension reform was an increase to
    net income of $114 million, net of income tax, due to the
    reduction of the insurance liabilities and other balances
    associated with the death and disability coverages of
    $197 million, net of income tax, which exceeded the
    establishment of the liability for future service obligations of
    $83 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. During 2008, the future servicing
    obligation was reduced by $23 million, net of income tax,
    when information regarding the level of participation in the
    government pension plan became fully available.

In September 2008, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled against the
    validity of the 2002 Pesification Law enacted by the Argentine
    government. This ruling applied to certain social security
    pension annuity contractholders that had filed a lawsuit against
    the 2002 Pesification Law. The annuity contracts impacted by
    this ruling, which were deemed peso denominated under the 2002
    Pesification Law, are now considered to be U.S. Dollar
    denominated obligations of the Company. The applicable
    contingent liabilities were then adjusted and refined to be
    consistent with this ruling. The impact of the refinements
    resulting from the change in these contingent liabilities and
    the associated future policyholder benefits was an increase to
    net income of $34 million, net of income tax, during the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

In October 2008, the Argentine government announced its
    intention to nationalize private pensions and, in December 2008,
    the Argentine government nationalized the private pension system
    seizing the underlying

F-141


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

investments of participants which were being managed by the
    Company (“Nationalization”). With this action, the
    Company’s pension business in Argentina ceased to exist and
    the Company eliminated certain assets and liabilities held in
    connection with the pension business. Deferred acquisition
    costs, deferred tax assets, and liabilities —
    primarily the liability for future servicing obligation referred
    to above — were eliminated and the Company incurred
    severance costs associated with the termination of employees.
    The impact of the elimination of assets and liabilities and the
    incurral of severance costs was an increase to net income of
    $6 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

As part of Nationalization, the Company may receive compensation
    from the Argentine government for the loss of the pension
    business in the form of government bonds. The amount of any such
    compensation, as well as the terms and value of the government
    bonds to be received, cannot be determined at this time. The
    compensation will only be reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company if and when the fair value
    of the compensation is received.

In March 2009, in light of market developments resulting from
    the Supreme Court ruling contrary to the Pesification Law and
    the implementation by the Company of a program to allow the
    contractholders that had not filed a lawsuit to convert to
    U.S. Dollars the social security annuity contracts
    denominated in pesos by the Pesification Law, the Company
    further reduced the outstanding contingent liabilities by
    $108 million, net of income tax, which was partially offset
    by the establishment of contingent liabilities from the
    implementation of the program to convert these contracts to
    U.S. Dollars of $13 million, net of income tax,
    resulting in a decrease to net loss of $95 million, net of
    income tax, for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Further governmental or legal actions are possible in Argentina.
    Such actions may impact the level of existing liabilities or may
    create additional obligations or benefits to the Company’s
    operations in Argentina. Management has made its best estimate
    of its obligations based upon information currently available;
    however, further governmental or legal actions could result in
    changes in obligations which could materially impact the amounts
    presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments

Leases

In accordance with industry practice, certain of the
    Company’s income from lease agreements with retail tenants
    are contingent upon the level of the tenants’ revenues.
    Additionally, the Company, as lessee, has entered into various
    lease and sublease agreements for office space, information
    technology and other equipment. Future minimum rental and
    sublease income, and minimum gross rental payments relating to
    these lease agreements are as follows:

During 2008, the Company moved certain of its operations in New
    York from Long Island City to New York City. As a result of this
    movement of operations and current market conditions, which
    precluded the Company’s immediate and complete sublet of
    all unused space in both Long Island City and New York City, the
    Company incurred a lease impairment charge of $38 million
    which is included within other expenses in Banking,
    Corporate &

F-142


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Other. The impairment charge was determined based upon the
    present value of the gross rental payments less sublease income
    discounted at a risk-adjusted rate over the remaining lease
    terms which range from

15-20 years.

The Company has made assumptions with respect to the timing and
    amount of future sublease income in the determination of this
    impairment charge. During 2009, pending sublease deals were
    impacted by the further decline of market conditions, which
    resulted in an additional lease impairment charge of
    $52 million. See Note 19 for discussion of
    $28 million of such charges related to restructuring.
    Additional impairment charges could be incurred should market
    conditions deteriorate further or last for a period
    significantly longer than anticipated.

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded
    commitments were $4.1 billion and $4.5 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company
    anticipates that these amounts will be invested in partnerships
    over the next five years.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $2.7 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company intends to sell the
    majority of these originated residential mortgage loans.
    Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans that will
    be

held-for-sale

are considered derivatives and their estimated fair value and
    notional amounts are included within interest rate forwards in
    Note 4.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be

held-for-investment.

The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $2.2 billion and $2.7 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.3 billion and
    $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as

third-party

lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to time
    limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $1.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe
    that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    that could become due under these guarantees in the future.
    Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to
    make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees,
    or commitments.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s

F-143


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

interests. Since these indemnities are generally not subject to
    limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does
    not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum
    potential amount that could become due under these indemnities
    in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    reduced $1 million of previously recorded liabilities
    related to certain investment transactions. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities were $5 million and $6 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, for indemnities,
    guarantees and commitments.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and final average earnings. The cash balance
    formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which credit
    participants with benefits equal to a percentage of eligible
    pay, as well as earnings credits, determined annually based upon
    the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2009, the majority of active participants are
    accruing benefits under the cash balance formula; however,
    approximately 92% of the Subsidiaries’ obligations result
    from benefits calculated with the traditional formula. The
    non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits in
    excess of limits applicable to a qualified plan.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

A December 31 measurement date is used for all of the
    Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans.

Net periodic pension cost and net periodic other postretirement
    benefit plan cost are comprised of the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    projected (expected) pension benefit obligation resulting from
    benefits payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service
    rendered during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the projected (expected) pension
    benefit obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    (other) pension fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the recognition of increases or decreases in pension (other
    postretirement) benefit obligation due to amendments in plans or
    initiation of new plans. These increases or decreases in
    obligation are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive
    income at the time of the amendment. These costs are then
    amortized to pension (other postretirement benefit) expense over
    the expected service years of the employees affected by the
    change.

MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to

    Statements — (Continued)

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on pension (other
    postretirement) plan assets or projected (expected) pension
    benefit obligation during a particular period. These gains and
    losses are accumulated and, to the extent they exceed 10% of the
    greater of the PBO or the fair value of plan assets, the excess
    is amortized into pension (other postretirement benefit) expense
    over the expected service years of the employees.

The discount rate is determined annually based on the yield,
    measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio
    constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate projected benefit obligation when due.

F-148


MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on
    anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which
    the plan invests, weighted by target allocation percentages.
    Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical
    returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the
    Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on the performance of
    the markets. While the precise expected return derived using
    this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the
    Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term assumption
    constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from
    the derived rate.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets for use in
    that plan’s valuation in 2010 is currently anticipated to
    be 8.00% for pension benefits and postretirement medical
    benefits and 7.20% for postretirement life benefits.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-and Post-Medicare eligible claims

8.2% down to 5.8% in 2018 and gradually decreasing until 2079
    reaching the ultimate rate of 4.1%

8.8% down to 5.8% in 2018 and gradually decreasing until 2079

    rates would have the following effects:

The fair values of the Subsidiaries’ pension plan assets at
    December 31, 2008 was $6,570 million.

The pension plan assets are categorized into the three-level
    fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note 1, based upon the
    priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique.
    The following summarizes the types of assets included within the
    three-level fair value hierarchy presented in the table above.

Level 1

This category includes investments in liquid securities, such as
    cash, short-term money market and bank time deposits, expected
    to mature within a year.

Level 2

This category includes certain separate accounts that are
    primarily invested in liquid and readily marketable securities.
    The estimated fair value of such separate account is based upon
    reported NAV provided by fund managers and this value represents
    the amount at which transfers in and out of the respective
    separate account are effected. These separate accounts provide
    reasonable levels of price transparency and can be corroborated
    through observable market data.

Certain separate accounts are invested in investment
    partnerships designated as hedge funds. The values for these
    separate accounts is determined monthly based on the NAV of the
    underlying hedge fund investment. Additionally, such hedge funds
    generally contain lock out or other waiting period provisions
    for redemption requests to be filled. While the reporting and
    redemption restrictions may limit the frequency of trading
    activity in separate accounts invested in hedge funds, the
    reported NAV, and thus the referenced value of the separate
    account, provides a reasonable level of price transparency that
    can be corroborated through observable market data. Directly
    held investments are primarily invested in U.S. and foreign
    government and corporate securities.

Level 3

This category includes separate accounts that are invested in
    real estate and private equity investments provide little or no
    price transparency due to the infrequency with which the
    underlying assets trade and generally require additional time to
    liquidate in an orderly manner. Accordingly, the values for
    separate accounts invested in these alternative asset classes
    are based on inputs that cannot be readily derived from or
    corroborated by observable market data.

The Subsidiaries provide employees with benefits under various
    ERISA benefit plans. These include qualified pension plans,
    postretirement medical plans and certain retiree life insurance
    coverage. The assets of MetLife’s qualified pension plans
    are held in insurance group annuity contracts, and the vast
    majority of the assets of the postretirement medical plan and
    backing the retiree life coverage are held in insurance
    contracts. All of these contracts are issued by Company
    insurance affiliates, and the assets under the contracts are
    held in insurance separate accounts that have been established
    by the Company. The insurance contract provider engages
    investment management firms (“Managers”) to serve as

sub-advisors

for the separate accounts based on the specific investment needs
    and requests identified by the plan fiduciary. These Managers
    have portfolio management discretion over the purchasing and
    selling of securities and other investment assets pursuant to
    the respective investment management agreements and guidelines
    established for each insurance separate account. The assets of
    the qualified pension plans and postretirement medical plans
    (the “Invested Plans”) are well diversified across
    multiple asset categories and across a number of different
    Managers, with the intent of minimizing risk concentrations
    within any given asset category or with any given Manager.

The Invested Plans, other than those held in participant
    directed investment accounts, are managed in accordance with
    investment policies consistent with the longer-term nature of
    related benefit obligations and within prudent risk parameters.
    Specifically, investment policies are oriented toward
    (i) maximizing the Invested Plan’s funded status;
    (ii) minimizing the volatility of the Invested Plan’s
    funded status; (iii) generating asset returns that exceed
    liability increases; and (iv) targeting rates of return in
    excess of a custom benchmark and industry standards over
    appropriate reference time periods. These goals are expected to
    be met through identifying appropriate and diversified asset
    classes and allocations, ensuring adequate liquidity to pay
    benefits and expenses when due and controlling the costs of
    administering and managing the Invested Plan’s investments.
    Independent investment consultants are periodically used to
    evaluate the investment risk of Invested Plan’s assets
    relative to liabilities, analyze the economic and portfolio
    impact of various asset allocations and management strategies
    and to recommend asset allocations.

Certain international subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans
    that cover employees and sales representatives who meet
    specified eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are
    provided utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance
    formula, similar to the U.S. plans discussed above. The
    investment objectives are also similar, subject to local
    regulations. Generally, these international pension plans invest
    directly in high quality equity and fixed maturity securities.

Derivative contracts may be used to reduce investment risk, to
    manage duration and to replicate the risk/return profile of an
    asset or asset class. Derivatives may not be used to leverage a
    portfolio in any manner, such as to magnify exposure to an
    asset, asset class, interest rates or any other financial
    variable. Derivatives are also

Expected
    Future Contributions and Benefit Payments

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plan to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of ERISA. In accordance with such practice, no
    contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 or 2008. No contributions will be
    required for 2010. The Subsidiaries made no discretionary
    contributions to the qualified pension plan during the year
    ended December 31, 2009. The Subsidiaries made
    discretionary contributions of $300 million to the
    qualified pension plan during the year ended December 31,
    2008. The Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions of $150 million in 2010.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $57 million and $43 million for the

F-153


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These
    payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in
    2010.

Postretirement benefits, other than those provided under
    qualified pension plans, are either: (i) not vested under
    law; (ii) a non-funded obligation of the Subsidiaries; or
    (iii) both. Current regulations do not require funding for
    these benefits. The Subsidiaries use their general assets, net
    of participant’s contributions, to pay postretirement
    medical claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing any plan
    assets. Total payments equaled $158 million and
    $149 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.

The Subsidiaries expect to make contributions of
    $119 million, net of participant’s contributions,
    towards benefit obligations (other than those under qualified
    pension plans) in 2010. As noted previously, the Subsidiaries
    expect to receive subsidies under the Prescription Drug Act to
    partially offset payment of such benefits.

Gross benefit payments for the next ten years, which reflect
    expected future service where appropriate, and gross subsidies
    to be received under the Prescription Drug Act are expected to
    be as follows:

Additional
    Information

As previously discussed, the assets of the pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans are held in group annuity and life
    insurance contracts issued by the Subsidiaries. Total revenue
    from these contracts recognized in the consolidated statements
    of operations was $45 million, $42 million and
    $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, and includes policy charges, net
    investment income from investments backing the contracts and
    administrative fees. Total investment income (loss), including
    realized and unrealized gains and losses, credited to the
    account balances were $725 million, ($1,090) million
    and $603 million for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The terms of these contracts
    are consistent in all material respects with those the
    Subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly
    situated.

Savings
    and Investment Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor savings and investment plans for
    substantially all Company employees under which a portion of
    employee contributions are matched. The Subsidiaries contributed
    $93 million, $70 million and $76 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Equity

Preferred
    Stock

In September 1999, the Holding Company adopted a stockholder
    rights plan (the “rights plan”). Under the rights
    plan, each outstanding share of common stock issued between
    April 4, 2000 and the distribution date (as defined in the
    rights plan) is coupled with a stockholder right. Each right
    will entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Each one
    one-hundredth of a share of Series A

F-154


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Junior Participating Preferred Stock will have economic and
    voting terms equivalent to one share of common stock. Until it
    is exercised, the right itself will not entitle the holder
    thereof to any rights as a stockholder, including the right to
    receive dividends or to vote at stockholder meetings.
    Stockholder rights are not exercisable until the distribution
    date. The rights plan will expire at the close of business on
    April 4, 2010, unless the rights are earlier redeemed or
    exchanged by the Holding Company. The Board of Directors of the
    Holding Company does not currently intend to renew it.

The Holding Company has outstanding 24 million shares of
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the
    “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of
    $600 million.

The Holding Company has outstanding 60 million shares of
    6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the
    “Series B preferred shares”), with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Series A and Series B preferred shares (the
    “Preferred Shares”) rank senior to the common stock
    with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on
    the Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the
    Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments
    only when, as and if declared by the Holding Company’s
    Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the board.
    If dividends are declared on the Series A preferred shares,
    they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of
    the greater of: (i) 1.00% above

3-month

LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the Holding Company has no obligation to
    pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not
    dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends
    may, however, be paid or declared on the Holding Company’s
    common stock — or any other securities ranking junior
    to the Preferred Shares — unless the full dividends
    for the latest completed dividend period on all Preferred
    Shares, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or
    provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board policy,
    the Holding Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does
    not earn sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share, plus
    declared and unpaid dividends.

In December 2008, the Holding Company entered into an RCC
    related to the Preferred Shares. As a part of the RCC, the
    Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem or
    purchase the Preferred Shares on or before December 31,
    2018, unless such repayment, redemption or purchase is made from
    the proceeds of the issuance of certain capital securities. The
    RCC is for the benefit of holders of one or more series of its
    indebtedness as designated from time to time by the Holding
    Company. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain
    events, including the date on which there are no series of
    outstanding eligible debt securities.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Description
    of Plans

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
    “Stock Incentive Plan”), authorized the granting of
    awards to employees and agents in the form of options to buy
    shares of the Holding Company’s common stock (“Stock
    Options”) that either qualify as incentive Stock Options
    under Section 422A of the Code or are

non-qualified.

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan, as amended
    (the “2000 Directors Stock Plan”), authorized the
    granting of awards in the form of the Holding Company’s
    common stock, non-qualified Stock Options, or a combination of
    the foregoing to non-management Directors of the Holding
    Company. Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive
    Compensation Plan, as amended (the “2005 Stock Plan”),
    awards granted to employees and agents may be in the form of
    Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or
    Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares or Performance Share
    Units, Cash-Based Awards and Stock-Based Awards (each as defined
    in the 2005 Stock Plan). Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005
    Non-Management Director Stock Compensation Plan (the
    “2005 Directors Stock Plan”), awards granted may
    be in the form of non-qualified Stock Options, Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
    or Stock-Based Awards (each as defined in the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan) to non-management Directors of
    the Holding Company. The Stock Incentive Plan,
    2000 Directors Stock Plan, 2005 Stock Plan and the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan are hereinafter collectively
    referred to as the “Incentive Plans.”

The aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan is 68,000,000, plus those shares available but
    not utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan and those shares
    utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan that are recovered due
    to forfeiture of Stock Options. Additional shares carried
    forward from the Stock Incentive Plan and available for issuance
    under the 2005 Stock Plan were 13,018,939 at December 31,
    2009. There were no shares carried forward from the
    2000 Directors Stock Plan. Each share issued under the 2005
    Stock Plan in connection with a Stock Option or Stock
    Appreciation Right reduces the number of shares remaining for
    issuance under that plan by one, and each share issued under the
    2005 Stock Plan in connection with awards other than Stock
    Options or Stock Appreciation Rights reduces the number of
    shares remaining for issuance under that plan by
    1.179 shares. The number of shares reserved for issuance
    under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan are 2,000,000. At
    December 31, 2009, the aggregate number of shares remaining
    available for issuance pursuant to the 2005 Stock Plan and the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan were 47,903,044 and 1,838,594,
    respectively.

Stock Option exercises and other stock-based awards to employees
    settled in shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares
    held in treasury by the Company. Under the current authorized
    share repurchase program, as described previously, sufficient
    treasury shares exist to satisfy foreseeable obligations under
    the Incentive Plans.

Compensation expense related to awards under the Incentive Plans
    is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest,
    which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures
    over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant.
    Unless a material deviation from the assumed rate is observed
    during the term in which the awards are expensed, any adjustment
    necessary to reflect differences in actual experience is
    recognized in the period the award becomes payable or
    exercisable. Compensation expense of $69 million,
    $123 million and $146 million, and income tax benefits
    of $24 million, $43 million and $51 million,
    related to the Incentive Plans was recognized for the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Compensation expense is principally related to the issuance of
    Stock Options, Performance Shares and Restricted Stock Units.
    The majority of the awards granted by the Holding Company are
    made in the first quarter of each year.

Stock
    Options

All Stock Options granted had an exercise price equal to the
    closing price of the Holding Company’s common stock as
    reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant,
    and have a maximum term of ten years. Certain Stock Options
    granted under the Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Stock Plan
    have or will become exercisable over a three year period
    commencing with the date of grant, while other Stock Options
    have or will

F-158


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

become exercisable three years after the date of grant. Stock
    Options issued under the 2000 Directors Stock Plan were
    exercisable immediately. The date at which a Stock Option issued
    under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan becomes exercisable
    would be determined at the time such Stock Option is granted.

A summary of the activity related to Stock Options for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 is presented below. The aggregate
    intrinsic value was computed using the closing share price on
    December 31, 2009 of $35.35 and December 31, 2008 of
    $34.86, as applicable.

The fair value of Stock Options is estimated on the date of
    grant using a binomial lattice model. Significant assumptions
    used in the Company’s binomial lattice model, which are
    further described below, include: expected volatility of the
    price of the Holding Company’s common stock; risk-free rate
    of return; expected dividend yield on the Holding Company’s
    common stock; exercise multiple; and the post-vesting
    termination rate.

Expected volatility is based upon an analysis of historical
    prices of the Holding Company’s common stock and call
    options on that common stock traded on the open market. The
    Company uses a weighted-average of the implied volatility for
    publicly-traded call options with the longest remaining maturity
    nearest to the money as of each valuation date and the
    historical volatility, calculated using monthly closing prices
    of the Holding Company’s common stock. The Company chose a
    monthly measurement interval for historical volatility as it
    believes this better depicts the nature of employee option
    exercise decisions being based on longer-term trends in the
    price of the underlying shares rather than on daily price
    movements.

The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates
    different risk-free rates based on the imputed forward rates for
    U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual
    term of the option. The table below presents the full range of
    rates that were used for options granted during the respective
    periods.

Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend
    distributions compared to the price of the underlying common
    stock as of the valuation date and held constant over the life
    of the Stock Option.

The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates the
    contractual term of the Stock Options and then factors in
    expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting termination rate,
    or the rate at which vested options are exercised or expire
    prematurely due to termination of employment, to derive an
    expected life. Exercise behavior in the binomial lattice model
    used by the Company is expressed using an exercise multiple,
    which reflects the ratio of exercise price to the strike price
    of Stock Options granted at which holders of the Stock Options
    are expected to exercise. The exercise multiple is derived from
    actual historical exercise activity. The post-vesting
    termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise
    experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.

Performance
    Shares

Beginning in 2005, certain members of management were awarded
    Performance Shares under (and as defined in) the 2005 Stock
    Plan. Participants are awarded an initial target number of
    Performance Shares with the final number of Performance Shares
    payable being determined by the product of the initial target
    multiplied by a performance factor of 0.0 to 2.0. The
    performance factor applied is based on measurements of the
    Holding Company’s performance, including with respect to:
    (i) the change in annual net operating earnings per share,
    as defined; and (ii) the proportionate total shareholder
    return, as defined, each with reference to the applicable
    three-year performance period relative to other companies in the
    S&P Insurance Index with reference to the same three-year
    period. Beginning with awards made in 2009, in order for
    Performance Shares to be payable, the Holding Company must
    generate positive net income for either the third year of the
    performance period or for the performance period as a whole.
    Also beginning with awards made in 2009, if the Holding
    Company’s Total Shareholder Return with reference to the
    applicable three-year performance period is zero percent or
    less, the performance factor will be multiplied by 75%.
    Performance Share awards will normally vest in their entirety at
    the end of the three-year performance period (subject to certain
    contingencies) and will primarily be payable in shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock.

Performance Share amounts above represent aggregate initial
    target awards and do not reflect potential increases or
    decreases resulting from the final performance factor to be
    determined at the end of the respective performance period. At
    December 31, 2009, the three year performance period for
    the 2007 Performance Share grants was completed. Included in the
    immediately preceding table are 801,750 outstanding Performance
    Shares to which the final performance factor will be applied.
    The calculation of the performance factor is expected to be
    finalized during the second quarter of 2010 after all data
    necessary to perform the calculation is publicly available.

Performance Share awards are accounted for as equity awards but
    are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends
    paid on the Holding Company’s common stock during the
    performance period. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of
    Performance Shares is based upon the closing price of the
    Holding Company’s common stock on the date of grant,
    reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid
    on that stock during the performance period.

Compensation expense related to initial Performance Shares
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is
    recognized ratably during the performance period. Compensation
    expense related to initial Performance Shares granted on or
    after January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is recognized
    ratably over the performance period or the period to retirement
    eligibility, if shorter. Performance Shares expected to vest and
    the related compensation expenses may be further adjusted by the
    performance factor most likely to be achieved, as estimated by
    management, at the end of the performance period. Compensation
    expense of $11 million, $70 million and
    $90 million, related to Performance Shares was recognized
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2009, there was $29 million of total
    unrecognized compensation costs related to Performance Share
    awards. It is expected that these costs will be recognized over
    a weighted average period of 1.52 years.

Restricted
    Stock Units

Beginning in 2005, certain members of management were awarded
    Restricted Stock Units under (and as defined in) the 2005 Stock
    Plan. Restricted Stock Unit awards will normally vest on the
    third or later anniversary of the date of the award (subject to
    certain contingencies) and each unit will be primarily payable
    entirely in shares of the Holding Company’s common stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Holding
    Company granted 295,000 Restricted Stock Units for which the
    total fair value on the date of grant was $6 million. The
    number of Restricted Stock Units outstanding at
    December 31, 2009 was 393,362 with a weighted average fair
    value of $28.05 per unit.

    $3 million, $2 million and $1 million related to
    Restricted Stock Units was recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 respectively.

At December 31, 2009, there was $5 million of total
    unrecognized compensation costs related to Restricted Stock
    Units. It is expected that these costs will be recognized over a
    weighted average period of 1.83 years.

Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Holding Company granted
    stock-based compensation awards to certain members of management
    under the Long-Term Performance Compensation Plan
    (“LTPCP”). The final LTPCP performance period
    concluded during 2007. The awards for the final LTPCP
    performance period, in the amount of 618,375 shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock and $16 million in
    cash, were paid during 2007. No significant compensation expense
    related to LTPCP was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Statutory
    Equity and Income

Each insurance company’s state of domicile imposes minimum
    risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that were
    developed by the NAIC. The formulas for determining the amount
    of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to
    financial balances or various levels of activity based on the
    perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by
    a ratio of total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to
    authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC.
    Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified
    within certain levels, each of which requires specified
    corrective action. Each of the Holding Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum RBC
    requirements for all periods presented herein.

The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Statutory Codification”). Statutory
    Codification is intended to standardize regulatory accounting
    and reporting to state insurance departments. However, statutory
    accounting principles continue to be established by individual
    state laws and permitted practices. The New York Insurance
    Department has adopted Statutory Codification with certain
    modifications for the preparation of statutory financial
    statements of insurance companies domiciled in New York.
    Modifications by the various state insurance departments may
    impact the effect of Statutory Codification on the statutory
    capital and surplus of the Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries.

Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by
    charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred,
    establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different
    actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus
    instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.

In addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory
    accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The
    most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net
    deferred income tax assets resulting from

temporary differences between statutory accounting principles
    basis and tax basis not expected to reverse and become
    recoverable within three years. Further, statutory accounting
    principles do not give recognition to purchase accounting
    adjustments.

Statutory net income (loss) of Metropolitan Life Insurance
    Company, a New York domiciled insurer, was $1,221 million,
    ($338) million and $2,123 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Statutory
    capital and surplus, as filed with the Department, was

Under New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount
    of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the
    lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or
    (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital
    gains). MLIC will be permitted to pay a dividend to the Holding
    Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it
    files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the
    amount thereof with the Superintendent and the Superintendent
    does not disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its
    filing. Under New York State Insurance Law, the Superintendent
    has broad discretion in determining whether the financial
    condition of a stock life insurance company would support the
    payment of such dividends to its shareholders. The New York
    State Department of Insurance (the “Department”) has
    established informal guidelines for such determinations. The
    guidelines, among other things, focus on the insurer’s
    overall financial condition and profitability under statutory
    accounting practices.

Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, MICC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to its stockholders as long as the amount of such
    dividends, when aggregated with all other dividends in the
    preceding 12 months, does not exceed the greater of:
    (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of
    the immediately preceding calendar year; or (ii) its
    statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding
    calendar year. MICC will be permitted to pay a dividend in
    excess of the greater of such two amounts only if it files
    notice of its declaration of such a dividend and the amount
    thereof with the Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance (the
    “Connecticut Commissioner”) and the Connecticut
    Commissioner does not disapprove the payment within 30 days
    after notice. In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned
    surplus (unassigned funds, reduced by 25% of unrealized
    appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized
    profits on investments) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under
    Connecticut State Insurance Law, the Connecticut Commissioner
    has broad discretion in determining whether the financial
    condition of a stock life insurance company would support the
    payment of such dividends to its shareholders.

Under Delaware State Insurance Law, MTL is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder
    dividend to the Holding Company as long as the amount of the
    dividend when aggregated with all other dividends in the
    preceding 12 months does not exceed the greater of:
    (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of the end of
    the immediately preceding calendar year; or (ii) its
    statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding
    calendar year (excluding realized capital gains). MTL will be
    permitted to pay a dividend to the Holding Company in excess of
    the greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of the
    declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the
    Delaware Commissioner of Insurance (the “Delaware
    Commissioner”) and the Delaware Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined
    as unassigned funds) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under Delaware
    State Insurance Law, the Delaware Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock life insurance company would support the payment of such
    dividends to its shareholders.

Under Rhode Island State Insurance Law, MPC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a
    stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any twelve-month
    period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its
    surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) net income, not including
    realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar
    year, which may include carry forward net income from the second
    and third preceding calendar years excluding realized capital
    gains and less dividends paid in the second and immediately
    preceding calendar years. MPC will be permitted to pay a
    dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such
    two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare
    such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Rhode Island
    Commissioner”) and the Rhode Island Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    Under Rhode Island State Insurance Code, the Rhode Island
    Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the
    financial condition of a stock property and casualty

    anticipated costs for lower variable incentive compensation,
    COBRA benefits, employee outplacement services and for employees
    whose severance status changed.

In 2009, the Company also recognized additional lease charges of
    $28 million and made cash payments of $2 million
    associated with the consolidation of office space.

Management anticipates further restructuring charges including
    severance, lease and asset impairments will be incurred during
    the year ending December 31, 2010. However, such
    restructuring plans are not sufficiently developed to enable the
    Company to make an estimate of such restructuring charges at
    December 31, 2009.

In addition to the restructuring charges incurred in connection
    with the aforementioned enterprise-wide initiative, the Company
    also incurred severance costs in connection with the Argentine
    government’s nationalization of its private pension
    business. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Company recognized a restructuring charge of $15 million
    within the International segment and made payments of
    $12 million resulting in a restructuring liability of
    $3 million at December 31, 2008. During the year ended
    December 31, 2009, the Company made payments of
    $3 million resulting in no restructuring liability at
    December 31, 2009.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a
    cumulative

out-of-period

adjustment in connection with the exclusion of certain
    derivative gains from the estimation of cumulative gross profits
    used in the determination of DAC amortization. The adjustment
    decreased DAC and increased DAC amortization by

F-169


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

$124 million and decreased net income by $80 million
    in the fourth quarter of 2008. Had the amounts been reflected
    during the first, second and third quarters of 2008
    — in the periods in which they arose — DAC
    amortization would have increased (decreased) by
    $100 million, ($61) million and $85 million,
    respectively, resulting in an increase (decrease) of net income
    by ($65) million, $40 million and ($55) million,
    respectively. Net income available to common shareholders per
    diluted common share would have been higher (lower) by ($0.09),
    $0.06, ($0.08) and $0.10 during the first, second, third and
    fourth quarters, respectively, of 2008 had the amounts been
    reflected in the periods in which they arose. Based upon an
    evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors,
    management believes this correcting adjustment was not material
    to the Company’s full year results for 2008 or the trend of
    earnings.

Business
    Segment Information

As further described in Note 1, during 2009 MetLife
    combined its former institutional and individual businesses, as
    well as its auto & home unit, into a single
    U.S. Business organization. U.S. Business consists of
    Insurance Products, Retirement Products, Corporate Benefit
    Funding and Auto & Home segments. The Company also has
    an International segment. In addition, the Company reports
    certain of its results of operations in Banking,
    Corporate & Other.

Insurance Products offers a broad range of protection products
    and services to individuals, corporations and other
    institutions, and is organized into three distinct businesses:
    Group Life, Individual Life and Non-Medical Health. Group Life
    insurance products and services include variable life, universal
    life and term life. Individual Life includes variable life,
    universal life, term life and whole life insurance products.
    Non-Medical Health includes short- and long-term disability,
    long-term care, and dental insurance, and other insurance
    products. Retirement Products offers asset accumulation and
    income products, including a wide variety of annuities.
    Corporate Benefit Funding offers pension risk solutions,
    structured settlements, stable value & investment
    products and other benefit funding products. Auto &
    Home provides personal lines property and casualty insurance,
    including private passenger automobile, homeowners and personal
    excess liability insurance.

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, annuities and retirement products to both individuals
    and groups.

Banking, Corporate & Other contains the excess capital
    not allocated to the business segments, the results of
    operations of MetLife Bank, various

start-up

entities and run-off entities, as well as interest expense
    related to the majority of the Company’s outstanding debt
    and expenses associated with certain legal proceedings and
    income tax audit issues. Banking, Corporate & Other
    also includes the elimination of intersegment amounts, which
    generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear interest
    rates commensurate with related borrowings. The operations of
    RGA are also reported in Banking, Corporate & Other as
    discontinued operations. See Note 23 for disclosures
    regarding discontinued operations, including real estate.

Operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss the
    Company uses to evaluate segment performance and allocate
    resources. Consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment
    reporting, it is the Company’s measure of segment
    performance reported below. Operating earnings is not determined
    in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute
    for GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income
    tax. However, the Company believes the presentation of operating
    earnings herein as we measure it for management purposes
    enhances the understanding of segment performance by
    highlighting the results from operations and the underlying
    profitability drivers of the businesses.

Operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less
    operating expenses, net of income tax.

Operating revenues is defined as GAAP revenues (i) less net
    investment gains (losses), (ii) less amortization of
    unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses),
    (iii) plus scheduled periodic settlement payments on
    derivative instruments that are hedges of investments but do not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (iv) plus income
    from discontinued real estate operations, and (v) plus, for
    operating joint ventures reported under the equity

F-170


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

method of accounting, the aforementioned adjustments and those
    identified in the definition of operating expenses, net of
    income tax, if applicable to these joint ventures.

Operating expenses is defined as GAAP expenses (i) less
    changes in experience-rated contractholder liabilities due to
    asset value fluctuations, (ii) less costs related to
    business combinations (since January 1, 2009) and
    noncontrolling interests, (iii) less amortization of DAC
    and VOBA and changes in the policyholder dividend obligation
    related to net investment gains (losses), and (iv) plus
    scheduled periodic settlement payments on derivative instruments
    that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not
    qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information
    with respect to the Company’s segments as well as Banking,
    Corporate & Other for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and at December 31,
    2009 and 2008. The accounting policies of the segments are the
    same as those of the Company, except for the method of capital
    allocation and the accounting for gains (losses) from
    intercompany sales, which are eliminated in consolidation.
    Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in the Company’s businesses. As a part of
    the economic capital process, a portion of net investment income
    is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated
    equity. The Company allocates certain non-recurring items, such
    as expenses associated with certain legal proceedings, to
    Banking, Corporate & Other.

Net investment income and net investment gains (losses) are
    based upon the actual results of each segment’s
    specifically identifiable asset portfolio adjusted for allocated
    equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based
    upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs;
    (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee
    compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost
    estimates included in the Company’s product pricing.

Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of
    consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007. Revenues from U.S. operations were

The operations of RGA included direct policies and reinsurance
    agreements with MetLife and some of its subsidiaries. These
    agreements are generally terminable by either party upon
    90 days written notice with respect to future new business.
    Agreements related to existing business generally are not
    terminable, unless the underlying policies terminate or are
    recaptured. These direct policies and reinsurance agreements do
    not constitute significant continuing involvement by the Company
    with RGA. Included in continuing operations in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations are amounts
    related to these transactions, including ceded amounts that
    reduced premiums and fees by $158 million and
    $251 million and ceded amounts that reduced policyholder
    benefits and claims by $136 million and $290 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, that have not been eliminated as these
    transactions have continued after the RGA disposition.

Subsequent
    Events

The Company evaluated the recognition and disclosure of
    subsequent events for its December 31, 2009 consolidated
    financial statements.

    Directors announced dividends of $0.2500000 per share, for a
    total of $6 million, on its Series A preferred shares,

    its Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 5, 2010,
    the earliest date permitted in accordance with the terms of the
    securities. Both dividends will be payable March 15, 2010
    to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2010.

Notes to
    the Condensed Financial Information of Registrant

1.

Basis of
    Presentation

The condensed financial information of MetLife, Inc. (the
    “Holding Company” or the “Registrant”)
    should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial
    Statements of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries and the notes
    thereto (the “Consolidated Financial Statements”).
    These condensed unconsolidated financial statements reflect the
    results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the
    Holding Company. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for
    using the equity method of accounting.

The condensed unconsolidated financial statements are prepared
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) except as stated
    previously which also requires management to make certain
    estimates and assumptions. The most important of these estimates
    and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the
    accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and
    the provision for potential losses that may arise from
    litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may
    affect the amounts reported in the condensed unconsolidated
    financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
    could differ materially from these estimates.

2.

Loans to
    Subsidiaries

The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. Such loans are included in loans to subsidiaries

In December 2009, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont’s (“MRV”)
    reinsurance of certain universal life and term life insurance
    risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause the third protected cell of MRV to
    maintain total adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200% of
    such protected cell’s authorized control level risk-based
    capital (“RBC”), as defined in state insurance
    statutes. The details of this transaction are disclosed in
    Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

In October 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MRV’s reinsurance of certain universal life and term life
    insurance risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause each of the two initial protected
    cells of MRV to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or
    greater than 200% of such protected cell’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    The details of this transaction are disclosed in Note 11 of
    the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of a portion of the liabilities associated with the
    closed block, committed to the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance to make capital contributions, if necessary, to MRC so
    that MRC may at all times maintain its total adjusted capital at
    a level of not less than 200% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes as in
    effect on the date of determination or December 31, 2007,
    whichever calculation produces the greater capital requirement,
    or as otherwise required by the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance. This collateral financing arrangement is more fully
    described in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to cause MRSC to maintain total adjusted capital equal to
    the greater of $250,000 or 100% of MRSC’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    This collateral financing arrangement is more fully described in
    Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by
    state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it
    to meet its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company has a net worth maintenance agreement with
    Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSMIC
    to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for MSMIC to
    maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as calculated in
    accordance with the Insurance Business Law of Japan, and to make
    such loans to MSMIC as may be necessary to ensure that MSMIC has
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment
    obligations as they fall due.

The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter, under a reinsurance agreement with MSMIC
    under which Exeter reinsures variable annuities written by MSMIC.

Based on management’s analysis and comparison of its
    current and future cash inflows from the dividends it receives
    from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior
    insurance regulatory approval, its asset portfolio and other
    cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets,
    management believes there will be sufficient liquidity and
    capital to enable the Holding Company to make payments on debt,
    make cash dividend payments on its common and preferred stock,
    contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay all operating
    expenses and meet its cash needs.

Controls
    and Procedures

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

There were no changes to the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,
    estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
    expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The
    objectives of internal control include providing management with
    reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are
    safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,
    and that transactions are executed in accordance with
    management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit
    the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with GAAP.

Financial management has documented and evaluated the
    effectiveness of the internal control of the Company at
    December 31, 2009 pertaining to financial reporting in
    accordance with the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
    2009.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered
    public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial
    statements and consolidated financial statement schedules
    included in the Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Report of the
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on their audit of
    the consolidated financial statements and consolidated financial
    statement schedules is included at

page F-1.

Attestation
    Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their
    attestation report on management’s internal control over
    financial reporting which is set forth below.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009,
    of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules and included an
    explanatory paragraph regarding changes in the Company’s
    method of accounting for the recognition and presentation of

other-than-temporary

impairment losses for certain investments as required by
    accounting guidance adopted on April 1, 2009.

Other
    Information

On February 23, 2010 the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. approved payment of annual
    incentive compensation awards, including awards in the following
    amounts to the following executive officers (the
    “Officers”):

William J. Wheeler

$

1,300,000

William J. Toppeta

$

900,000

Steven A. Kandarian

$

1,100,000

The Committee exercised its judgment in approving these awards
    taking into account the Company’s overall business and
    financial performance, as well as business unit and individual
    Officer performance for 2009. Under the leadership of
    Mr. Henrikson and the Holding Company’s Executive
    Group, including the Officers, the Company achieved in 2009
    operating earnings available to common shareholders of
    $2.4 billion, operating earnings available to common
    shareholders per diluted share of $2.87, operating return on
    common equity of 6.7% and December 31, 2009 book value per
    diluted common share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), of $41.50. The Company’s premiums, fee and
    other revenues increased to $34.0 billion from
    $32.9 billion in 2008. The Company achieved strong results
    on the Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment of
    the 19 largest financial holding companies (the “stress
    test”), and was the only one of the 19 companies that
    did not participate in the Troubled Asset Relief Program.

The Committee also considered certain non-financial achievements
    in making these awards. The Company held or gained market share
    in U.S. Business, grew International’s premiums, fees
    and other revenues, maintained risk management and product
    pricing discipline, and exceeded 2009 targets in the Operational
    Excellence initiative resulting in significant annual expense
    savings and improvements in overall business processes.

The Committee recognized the fact that these results were
    achieved in a difficult economic climate. It also considered
    each Officer’s performance in light of the Officer’s
    particular goals in determining the Officer’s annual
    incentive award. The factors considered for each Officer will be
    described in MetLife, Inc.’s definitive proxy statement for
    the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 27,
    2010.

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the
    deductibility of compensation paid to four of the Holding
    Company’s most highly-compensated executives, but exempts
    certain “performance-based” compensation from those
    limits. Earlier in 2009, the Committee established limits for
    awards under the MetLife Annual Variable Incentive Plan
    (“AVIP”) to the Holding Company’s Executive Group
    members. These limits were established for the tax purpose of
    qualifying AVIP awards for 2009 under Section 162(m), and
    were based on the Company’s net income for 2009. Since the
    Company had negative net income, the Committee was precluded
    from making deductible AVIP awards to four of the Holding
    Company’s most highly-compensated executives. The annual
    incentive awards the Committee approved were not made under AVIP
    and will not be deductible with respect to these executives. The
    estimated value of the lost deduction is approximately
    $2 million.

In making these awards, the Committee took into account all of
    the above factors as well as the fact that the Company would
    have derived positive net income but for a net investment loss
    of $3.2 billion that was related largely to derivative
    positions the Company held as part of its overall risk
    management and asset-liability management strategies. The risk
    management derivatives are part of the Company’s
    risk-mitigation strategy to hedge interest rate, equity,
    currency, and credit risks. If the Company had not used the risk
    management derivatives, management believes the Company may have
    been exposed to excessive risks and may not have been managing
    its risks in a prudent manner. Accordingly, the Committee
    concluded that these net losses were significantly related to
    prudent risk management.

Benefit plans in which the Officers participate will be amended
    effective February 22, 2010 so that the 2009 annual
    incentive compensation awards will be included as part of the
    compensation used to determine benefits on the same basis as
    AVIP awards.



Each of the Officers’ benefits under the MetLife Auxiliary
    Pension Plan (the “Auxiliary Pension Plan”) will be
    determined based on a definition of compensation that includes
    the 2009 annual incentive compensation awards. As a result of
    the amendments, Mr. Wheeler’s and
    Mr. Kandarian’s pension benefits will reflect a
    company contribution equal to 10% of their 2009 annual incentive
    compensation awards to their respective personal retirement
    accounts. The amendments will increase the annual present value
    of Mr. Henrikson’s traditional formula pension benefit
    that will be accrued through 2010 (by approximately $180,000)
    because the 2009 annual incentive compensation award is included
    in the calculation of his traditional formula benefit. Each of
    the Officers will also receive a company contribution equal to
    4% of their 2009 annual incentive compensation awards in the
    Metropolitan Life Auxiliary Savings and Investment Plan, a
    nonqualified defined contribution plan.

Each Officer will receive disability benefits coverage from
    March 15, 2010 through March 15, 2011, taking into
    account the value of the 2009 annual incentive compensation
    awards as part of the income that would be replaced should the
    Officer qualify for benefits. In addition, Mr. Henrikson
    and Mr. Toppeta will each receive survivor income benefits
    coverage from January 1, 2011 through March 15, 2011,
    taking into account the value of his 2009 annual incentive
    compensation award as part of the income that would be replaced
    as death benefits.

The above discussion includes references to our performance
    measures operating earnings and operating earnings available to
    common shareholders that are not based on GAAP. Operating
    earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to
    evaluate segment performance and allocate resources and,
    consistent with GAAP accounting guidance for segment reporting,
    is our measure of segment performance. Operating earnings is
    also a measure by which our senior management’s and many
    other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes
    of determining their compensation under applicable compensation
    plans. Operating earnings available to common shareholders is
    defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends.
    Operating earnings per diluted share is determined by dividing
    operating earnings available to common shareholders by the
    number of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.
    Operating return on common equity is determined by dividing
    operating earnings available to common shareholders by average
    common equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss.
    Book value per diluted common share, excluding accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, is determined by dividing book value less
    accumulated other comprehensive loss by the number of weighted
    average diluted common shares outstanding. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations” for additional
    information regarding how the Company calculates operating
    earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders.
