PART I

Item 1.

Business

As used in this

Form 10-K,

“MetLife,” the “Company,” “we,”
    “our” and “us” refer to MetLife, Inc., a
    Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“Metropolitan Life”).

We are a leading provider of insurance and other financial
    services with operations throughout the United States and the
    regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through our
    domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer
    life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners insurance,
    retail banking and other financial services to individuals, as
    well as group insurance, reinsurance and retirement &
    savings products and services to corporations and other
    institutions.

We are one of the largest insurance and financial services
    companies in the United States. Our franchises and brand names
    uniquely position us to be the preeminent provider of protection
    and savings and investment products in the United States. In
    addition, our international operations are focused on markets
    where the demand for insurance and savings and investment
    products is expected to grow rapidly in the future.

Our well-recognized brand names, leading market positions,
    competitive and innovative product offerings and financial
    strength and expertise should help drive future growth and
    enhance shareholder value, building on a long history of
    fairness, honesty and integrity.

Over the course of the next several years, we will pursue the
    following specific strategies to achieve our goals:

•

Build on widely recognized brand names

•

Capitalize on a large customer base

•

Enhance capital efficiency

•

Expand distribution channels

•

Continue to introduce innovative and competitive products

•

Focus on international operations

•

Maintain balanced focus on asset accumulation and protection
    products

•

Manage operating expenses commensurate with revenue growth

•

Further commit to a diverse workplace

•

Capitalize on retirement income needs

We are organized into five operating segments: Institutional,
    Individual, Auto & Home, International and Reinsurance,
    as well as Corporate & Other. Revenues derived from any
    customer, or from any class of similar products or services,
    within each of these segments did not exceed 10% of consolidated
    revenues in any of the last three years. Financial information,
    including revenues, expenses, income and loss, and total assets
    by segment, is provided in Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”) for $12.1 billion.
    The results of Travelers’ operations were included in our
    financial statements beginning July 1, 2005. As a result of
    the acquisition, our management increased significantly the size
    and scale of our core insurance and annuity products and
    expanded our presence in both the retirement & savings
    domestic and international markets. The distribution agreements
    executed with Citigroup as part of the acquisition provide us
    with one of the broadest distribution networks in the industry.
    The initial consideration paid by the Holding Company for the
    acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock with a market value of $1.0 billion to Citigroup and
    $100 million in other transaction costs. Additional
    consideration of $115 million was paid by the



Holding Company to Citigroup in 2006 as a result of the
    finalization by both parties of their review of the
    June 30, 2005 financial statements and final resolution as
    to the interpretation of the provisions of the acquisition
    agreement. In addition to cash on-hand, the purchase price was
    financed through the issuance of common stock, debt securities,
    common equity units and preferred stock. The acquisition was
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which
    requires that the assets and liabilities of Travelers be
    measured at their fair values as of July 1, 2005.

Institutional

Our Institutional segment offers a broad range of group
    insurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions and their
    respective employees. We have built a leading position in the
    U.S. group insurance market through long-standing
    relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in
    the United States.

Group insurance products and services include group life
    insurance, non-medical health insurance products and related
    administrative services, as well as other benefits, such as
    employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance provided
    through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid legal
    services plans. Non-medical health insurance is comprised of
    products such as accidental death and dismemberment
    (“AD&D”), long-term care (“LTC”), short-
    and long-term disability, critical illness and dental insurance.
    We offer group insurance products as employer-paid benefits or
    as voluntary benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are
    paid by the employee. Revenues applicable to these group
    insurance products and services were $13 billion in 2006,
    representing 27% of our total revenues in 2006.

Our retirement & savings products and services include
    an array of annuity and investment products, as well as bundled
    administrative and investment services sold to sponsors of
    small- and mid-sized 401(k) plans, the majority of which was
    sold during the fourth quarter of 2006, and other defined
    contribution plans, guaranteed interest products and other
    stable value products, accumulation and income annuities, and
    separate account contracts for the investment of defined benefit
    and defined contribution plan assets. Revenues applicable to our
    retirement & savings products were $7 billion in
    2006, representing 15% of our total revenues in 2006.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Institutional segment markets our products and services
    through sales forces, comprised of MetLife employees, for both
    our group insurance and retirement & savings lines.

We distribute our group insurance products and services through
    a regional sales force that is segmented by the size of the
    target customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly
    to corporate and other institutional customers or through an
    intermediary, such as a broker or a consultant. Voluntary
    products are sold through the same sales channels, as well as by
    specialists for these products. Employers have been emphasizing
    such voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our
    focus on communicating and marketing to such employees in order
    to further foster sales of those products. As of
    December 31, 2006, the group insurance sales channels had
    approximately 363 marketing representatives.

Our retirement & savings organization markets
    retirement, savings, investment and payout annuity products and
    services to sponsors and advisors of benefit plans of all sizes.
    These products and services are offered to private and public
    pension plans, collective bargaining units, nonprofit
    organizations, recipients of structured settlements and the
    current and retired members of these and other institutions.

We distribute retirement & savings products and
    services through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers
    located in 15 offices around the country. In addition, the
    retirement & savings organization works with the
    distribution channels in the Individual segment and in the group
    insurance area to better reach and service customers, brokers,
    consultants and other intermediaries.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
    arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and
    distribution opportunities of institutional products and
    services. We also seek to sell our institutional products and
    services through sponsoring organizations and affinity groups.
    For example, we are the provider of LTC products for the
    American Association of Retired Persons and the National
    Long-Term Care Coalition, a group of



some of the nation’s largest employers. In addition, the
    Company, together with John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation, is a
    provider for the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance program. The
    program, available to most Federal employees and their families,
    is the largest employer-sponsored LTC insurance program in the
    country based on the number of enrollees. In addition, we also
    provide life and dental coverage to Federal employees.

    income benefits. These products and services are offered as
    standard products or may be tailored to meet specific customer

    products designed specifically to provide solutions for
    non-qualified benefit and retiree benefit funding purposes.

    investment management of defined benefit and defined

Individual

Our Individual segment offers a wide variety of protection and
    asset accumulation products aimed at serving the financial needs
    of our customers throughout their entire life cycle. Products
    offered by Individual include insurance products, such as
    traditional, universal and variable life insurance, and variable
    and fixed annuities. In addition, Individual sales
    representatives distribute disability insurance and LTC
    insurance products offered through the Institutional segment,
    investment products such as mutual funds, as well as other
    products offered by our other businesses. Individual’s
    principal distribution channels are the agency distribution
    group and the independent distribution group. Individual also
    distributes products through several additional distribution
    channels, including Walnut Street Securities, Inc. (“Walnut
    Street Securities”), MetLife Resources, Tower Square
    Securities, Inc. (“Tower Square Securities”) and Texas
    Life Insurance Company (“Texas Life”). In total,
    Individual had approximately 11,000 active sales representatives
    at December 31, 2006.

Our broadly recognized brand names and strong distribution
    channels have allowed us to become the second largest provider
    of individual life insurance and annuities in the United States,
    with $17 billion of total statutory individual life and
    annuity premiums and deposits through September 30, 2006,
    the latest period for which OneSource, a database that
    aggregates United States insurance company statutory financial
    statements, is available. According to research performed by the
    Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association
    (“LIMRA”), based on sales through September 30,
    2006, we are the sixth largest issuer of individual variable
    life insurance in the United States and the sixth largest issuer
    of all individual life insurance products in the United States.
    In addition, according



to research done by LIMRA and based on new annuity deposits
    through September 30, 2006, we are the second largest
    annuity writer in the United States.

During the period from 2002 to 2006, our first year statutory
    deposits for life products increased at a compound annual growth
    rate of approximately 5%. Life deposits represented
    approximately 33% of total statutory premiums and deposits for
    Individual in 2006. During the same period from 2002 to 2006,
    the statutory deposits for annuity products increased at a
    compound annual growth rate of approximately 18%. Annuity
    deposits represented approximately 67% of total statutory
    premiums and deposits for Individual in 2006. Individual had
    $14.5 billion of total revenues, or 30% of our total
    revenues, in 2006.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Individual segment targets the large middle-income market,
    as well as affluent individuals, owners of small businesses and
    executives of small- to medium-sized companies. We have been
    successful in selling our products in various multi-cultural
    markets. Individual products are distributed nationwide through
    multiple channels, with the primary distribution systems being
    the agency distribution group and the independent distribution
    group.

Agency Distribution Group.

The agency
    distribution group is comprised of two channels, the MetLife
    Distribution Channel, a career agency system, and the New
    England Financial Distribution Channel, a general agency system.

MetLife Distribution Channel.

The MetLife
    Distribution Channel had 5,968 agents under contract in 102
    agencies at December 31, 2006. The career agency sales
    force focuses on the large middle-income and affluent markets,
    including multi-cultural markets. We support our efforts in
    multi-cultural markets through targeted advertising, specially
    trained agents and sales literature written in various
    languages. Multi-cultural markets represented 35% of the MetLife
    Distribution Channel’s individual life sales in 2006. The
    average face amount of a life insurance policy sold through the
    MetLife Distribution Channel in 2006 was $313 thousand.

Agents in the career agency system are full-time MetLife common
    law

and/or

statutory employees who are compensated primarily based upon
    sales which is in compliance with the limitations imposed by New
    York State Insurance Law Section 4228. These career agents
    are also eligible to receive certain benefits. Agents in the
    career agency system are not authorized to sell other
    insurers’ products without our approval. At
    December 31, 2006, 95% of the agents in the career agency
    sales force were licensed to sell one or more of the following
    products: variable life insurance, variable annuities and mutual
    funds.

From 2005 through 2006, the number of agents under contract in
    the MetLife Distribution Channel’s career agency sales
    force increased from 5,804 to 5,968. The increase in the number
    of agents is due to improving retention which, in-turn, drives
    increased productivity. From 2002 through 2006, the career
    agency system increased productivity, with net sales credits per
    agent, an industry measure for agent productivity, growing at a
    compound annual rate of 6%.

New England Financial Distribution
    Channel.

The New England Financial Distribution
    Channel targets high net-worth individuals, owners of small
    businesses and executives of small- to medium-sized companies.
    The average face amount of a life insurance policy sold through
    the New England Financial Distribution Channel in 2006 was $561
    thousand.

At December 31, 2006, the New England Financial
    Distribution Channel included 46 general agencies providing
    support to 2,035 agents and a network of independent brokers
    throughout the United States. The compensation of agents who are
    independent contractors and general agents who have exclusive
    contracts with New England Financial is based on sales, although
    general agents are also provided with an allowance for benefits
    and other expenses. At December 31, 2006, 95% of New
    England Financial’s agents were licensed to sell one or
    more of the following products: variable life insurance,
    variable annuities and mutual funds.

Independent Distribution Group.

During 2005,
    the independent distribution group was expanded to include
    Travelers distribution, as well as General American Financial
    and the MetLife Investors Group. Within the independent
    distribution group there are three wholesaler organizations,
    including the coverage and point of sale



models for risk-based products, and the annuity wholesale model
    for accumulation-based products. Both the coverage and point of
    sale model wholesalers distribute universal life, variable
    universal life, traditional life, LTC and disability income
    products. The annuity model wholesalers distribute both fixed
    and variable deferred annuities, as well as income annuities. We
    intend to continue to grow existing distribution relationships
    and acquire new relationships in the coverage, point of sale and
    annuity channels by capitalizing on an experienced management
    team, leveraging the MetLife brand and resources, and developing
    high service, low cost operations while continuing the
    distribution of other MetLife products.

Coverage Model.

The coverage model wholesalers
    sell universal life, variable universal life, traditional life,
    LTC and disability insurance products and related financial
    services to high net worth individuals and small- to
    medium-sized businesses through independent general agencies,
    financial advisors, consultants, brokerage general agencies and
    other independent marketing organizations under contractual
    arrangements. These agencies and individuals are independent
    contractors who are generally responsible for the expenses of
    operating their agencies, including office and overhead
    expenses, and the recruiting, selection, contracting, training,
    and development of agents and brokers in their agencies. The
    wholesalers direct sales and recruiting efforts from a
    nationwide network of regional offices. As of December 31,
    2006, the coverage model’s sales force included 25
    wholesalers.

Point of Sale Model.

The point of sale model
    wholesalers sell universal life, variable universal life,
    traditional life, LTC and disability income products through
    financial intermediaries, including regional broker-dealers,
    brokerage firms, financial planners and banks. As of
    December 31, 2006, there were 54 regional point of sale
    model wholesalers.

Annuity Model.

The annuity model wholesalers
    sell individual fixed and variable deferred annuities, as well
    as income annuity products through financial intermediaries,
    including regional broker-dealers, New York Stock Exchange
    (“NYSE”) brokerage firms, financial planners and
    banks. As of December 31, 2006, there were 132 regional
    annuity model wholesalers.

Additional Distribution Channels.

The
    Individual segment also distributes our individual insurance and
    investment products through several additional affiliated
    distribution channels, including Walnut Street Securities, Tower
    Square Securities, Texas Life and MetLife Resources.

Walnut Street Securities.

Walnut Street
    Securities, a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., is an affiliated
    broker-dealer that markets variable life insurance and variable
    annuity products, as well as mutual funds and other securities,
    through 894 independent registered representatives.

Tower Square Securities.

Tower Square
    Securities, a subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., is an affiliated
    broker-dealer that markets variable life insurance and variable
    annuity products, as well as mutual funds and other securities,

Texas Life.

Texas Life, a subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc., markets whole life and universal life insurance
    products under the Texas Life name through approximately 1,218
    active independent insurance brokers. These brokers are
    independent contractors who sell insurance for Texas Life on a
    nonexclusive basis. A number of MetLife career agents also
    market Texas Life products. Texas Life sells universal life
    insurance policies with low cash values that are marketed
    through the use of brochures, as well as payroll deduction life
    insurance products.

MetLife Resources.

MetLife Resources, a
    focused distribution channel of MetLife, markets retirement,
    annuity and other financial products on a national basis through
    737 agents and independent brokers. MetLife Resources targets
    the nonprofit, educational and healthcare markets.

Products

We offer a wide variety of individual insurance, as well as
    annuities and investment-type products, aimed at serving our
    customers’ financial needs throughout their entire life
    cycle.



Insurance
    Products

Our individual insurance products include variable life
    products, universal life products, traditional life products,
    including whole life and term life, and other individual
    products, including individual disability and LTC insurance.

We continually review and update our products. We have
    introduced new products and features designed to increase the
    competitiveness of our portfolio and the flexibility of our
    products to meet the broad range of asset accumulation,
    life-cycle protection and distribution needs of our customers.
    Some of these updates have included new universal life policies
    and updated variable universal life products.

Variable Life.

Variable life products provide
    insurance coverage through a contract that gives the
    policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on
    the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with
    certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life
    products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the
    policyholder into a variety of separate accounts or directed to
    the Company’s general account. In the separate accounts,
    the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment
    results. We collect specified fees for the management of these
    various investment accounts and any net return is credited
    directly to the policyholder’s account. In some instances,
    third-party money management firms manage investment accounts
    that support variable insurance products. With some products, by
    maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the
    advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death
    benefit from adverse investment experience.

Universal Life.

Universal life products
    provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life,
    except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances,
    are allocated only to the Company’s general account.
    Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or
    decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of
    the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of
    premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained
    for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified
    expenses and interest, at interest rates we determine, subject
    to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the
    policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection
    and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain
    premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Whole Life.

Whole life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for
    the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined
    period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of
    the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be
    level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
    Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a
    participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders
    may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death
    benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or
    reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.
    Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder,
    this group of products provides significant flexibility to
    individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs
    and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed
    benefits.

Term Life.

Term life provides a guaranteed
    benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time
    period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified
    coverage periods range from one year to 20 years, but in no
    event are they longer than the period over which premiums are
    paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing.
    Decreasing coverage is used principally to provide for loan
    repayment in the event of death. Premiums may be guaranteed at a
    level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and
    non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred
    to as pure protection products, in that there are typically no
    savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without
    value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party
    is still living.

Other Individual Products.

Individual
    disability products provide a benefit in the event of the
    disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in
    the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches
    age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may
    be used to provide for the payment of business overhead expenses
    for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection.

Our LTC insurance provides a fixed benefit for certain costs
    associated with nursing home care and other services that may be
    provided to individuals unable to perform certain activities of
    daily living.



In addition to these products, our Individual segment supports a
    group of low face amount life insurance policies, known as
    industrial policies, that its agents sold until 1964.

Annuities
    and Investment Products

We offer a variety of individual annuities and investment
    products, including variable and fixed annuities, and mutual
    funds and securities.

Variable Annuities.

We offer variable
    annuities for both asset accumulation and asset distribution
    needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make
    deposits into various investment accounts, as determined by the
    contractholder. The investment accounts are separate accounts
    and risks associated with such investments are borne entirely by
    the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products,
    contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of
    their account to the Company’s general account and are
    credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain
    minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain
    minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for
    which additional fees are charged.

Fixed Annuities.

Fixed annuities are used for
    both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed
    annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided
    by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the
    preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made
    into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited
    interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited
    periods of time, ranging from one to ten years. Fixed income
    annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
    period of years

and/or

for
    the life of the annuitant.

Mutual Funds and Securities.

Through our
    broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of mutual funds
    and other securities products.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home, operating through Metropolitan Property
    and Casualty Insurance Company (“MPC”) and its
    subsidiaries, offers personal lines property and casualty
    insurance directly to employees at their employer’s
    worksite, as well as to individuals through a variety of retail
    distribution channels, including the agency distribution group,
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists and direct
    response marketing. Auto & Home primarily sells auto
    insurance, which represented 71% of Auto & Home’s
    total net premiums earned in 2006, and homeowners insurance,
    which represented 29% of Auto & Home’s total net
    premiums earned in 2006.

Products

Auto & Home’s insurance products include:

•

auto, including both standard and non-standard private passenger;

•

homeowners, renters, condominium and dwelling; and

•

other personal lines, including personal excess liability
    (protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other
    liability insurance policies), recreational vehicles and boat
    owners.

Auto Coverages.

Auto insurance policies
    include coverages for private passenger automobiles, utility
    automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or
    classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers
    traditional coverages such as liability, uninsured motorist, no
    fault or personal injury protection and collision and
    comprehensive coverages. Auto & Home also offers
    non-standard auto insurance, which accounted for
    $47 million in net premiums earned in 2006 and represented
    2.3% of total auto net premiums earned in 2006.

Homeowners Coverages.

Homeowners insurance
    provides protection for homeowners, renters, condominium owners
    and residential landlords against losses arising out of damage
    to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils, as well
    as coverage for liability arising from ownership or occupancy.



Traditional insurance policies for dwellings represent the
    majority of Auto & Home’s homeowners policies
    providing protection for loss on a “replacement cost”
    basis. These policies provide additional coverage for
    reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders
    that have been displaced from their homes.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Personal lines auto and homeowners insurance products are
    directly marketed to employees at their employer’s
    worksite. Auto & Home products are also marketed and
    sold to individuals by the agency distribution group,
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists and
    through a direct response channel.

Employer
    Worksite Programs

Auto & Home is a leading provider of auto and
    homeowners products offered to employees at their
    employer’s worksite. Net premiums earned through this
    distribution channel grew at a compound annual rate of 3.6%,
    from $832 million in 2002 to $992 million in 2006. At
    December 31, 2006, approximately 2,000 employers offered
    MetLife Auto & Home products to their employees.

Institutional marketing representatives market the
    Auto & Home program to employers through a variety of
    means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to MetLife
    group customers. Once permitted by the employer, MetLife
    commences marketing efforts to employees. Employees who are
    interested in the auto and homeowners products can call a
    toll-free number to request a quote, to purchase coverage and to
    request payroll deduction over the telephone. Auto &
    Home has also developed proprietary software that permits an
    employee in most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance
    through Auto & Home’s Internet website.

Retail
    Distribution Channels

We market and sell Auto & Home products through the
    agency distribution group, independent agents, property and
    casualty specialists and through a direct response channel. In
    recent years, we have increased the number of independent agents
    and property and casualty specialists appointed to sell these
    products.

Agency Distribution Group Career Agency
    System.

The agency distribution group career
    agency system has approximately 1,600 agents that sell
    Auto & Home insurance products.

Independent Agencies.

At December 31,
    2006, Auto & Home maintained contracts with more than
    4,300 agencies and brokers.

Property and Casualty
    Specialists.

Auto & Home has 648
    specialists located in 35 states. Auto &
    Home’s strategy is to utilize property and casualty
    specialists, who are Auto & Home employees, in
    geographic markets that are underserved by MetLife career agents.

Other Distribution Channels.

Auto &
    Home also utilizes a direct response marketing channel which
    permits sales to be generated through sources such as target
    mailings, career agent referrals and the Internet.

In 2006, Auto & Home’s business was mostly
    concentrated in the following states, as measured by net
    premiums earned: New York $383 million, or 13.1%;
    Massachusetts $356 million, or 12.2%; Illinois
    $198 million, or 6.8%; Florida $193 million, or 6.6%;

Auto & Home’s claims department includes
    approximately 2,000 employees located in Auto &
    Home’s Warwick, Rhode Island home office, 11 field claim
    offices, 6 in-house counsel offices, drive-in inspection sites
    and other sites throughout the United States. These employees
    include claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys, managers,
    medical specialists, investigators, customer service
    representatives, claim financial analysts and support staff.
    Claim adjusters, representing the majority of employees,
    investigate, evaluate and settle over 650,000 claims annually,
    principally by telephone.



International

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities and retirement &
    savings products to both individuals and groups. We focus on
    emerging markets primarily within the Latin America, Europe and
    Asia Pacific regions. We operate in international markets
    through subsidiaries and joint ventures. The acquisition of
    Travelers in 2005 added operations in the following new markets:
    Australia, Belgium, Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom; as
    well as in markets in which we already operate: Argentina,
    Brazil, Hong Kong, India and China. See “Risk
    Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could Negatively Affect Our
    Profitability,” and “Risk Factors — Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability,” and “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Latin
    America

We operate in the Latin America region in the following
    countries: Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The
    operations in Mexico, Chile and Argentina represented 88% of the
    total premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The Mexican operation is the largest
    life insurance company in both the individual and group
    businesses in Mexico. The Chilean operation is the fourth
    largest annuity company in Chile, based on market share. The
    Chilean operation also offers individual life insurance and
    group insurance products. The Argentinean operation is the
    second largest pension company in the market, based on employee
    contributions. The Argentinean operation actively markets
    individual life insurance, group insurance products and credit
    life coverage.

Asia
    Pacific

We operate in the Asia Pacific region in the following
    countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and
    China. The operations in South Korea and Taiwan represented 85%
    of the total premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The South Korean operation offers
    individual life insurance, annuities, retirement &
    savings and non-medical health products, as well as group
    retirement products. The Taiwanese operation offers individual
    life, accident and health, personal travel insurance products
    and annuities, as well as group life and group accident and
    health insurance products. The Japanese operation offers fixed
    and guaranteed variable annuities and variable life products.
    The Japanese operation is not included in total premiums and
    fees but are included as a component of our net investment
    income.

Europe

We operate in Europe in the following countries: the United
    Kingdom, Belgium, Poland and Ireland. The results of our
    operation in India are also included in this region. The
    operation in the United Kingdom represented 61% of the total
    premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The United Kingdom operation underwrites
    risk in its home market and 13 other countries across Europe,
    offering credit insurance and personal accident coverage.

Reinsurance

Our Reinsurance segment is comprised of the life reinsurance
    business of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated
    (“RGA”), a publicly traded company (NYSE: RGA). At
    December 31, 2006, our ownership in RGA was approximately
    53%.

RGA’s operations in North America are its largest and
    include operations of its Canadian and U.S. subsidiaries.
    In addition to these operations, RGA has subsidiary companies,
    branch offices, or representative offices in Australia,
    Barbados, China, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico,
    Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and the United
    Kingdom.

In addition to its life reinsurance business, RGA provides
    reinsurance of asset-intensive products, critical illness and
    financial reinsurance. RGA and its predecessor, the reinsurance
    division of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“General American”), have been engaged in the
    business of life reinsurance since 1973. As of



December 31, 2006, RGA had $19 billion and $2.0
    trillion in consolidated assets and worldwide life reinsurance
    in-force, respectively.

RGA’s
    Products and Services

RGA’s operational segments are segregated primarily by
    geographic region: United States, Canada, Asia Pacific and
    Europe & South Africa, as well as Corporate &
    Other. The U.S. operations, which represented 61% of
    RGA’s 2006 net premiums, provide traditional life,
    asset-intensive products and financial reinsurance to domestic
    clients. Traditional life reinsurance involves RGA indemnifying
    another insurance company for all or a portion of the insurance
    risk, primarily mortality risk, it has written. Asset-intensive
    products primarily include the reinsurance of corporate-owned
    life insurance and annuities. Financial reinsurance involves
    assisting RGA’s clients (other insurance companies) in
    managing their regulatory capital or in achieving other
    financial goals. The Canadian operations, which represented 10%
    of RGA’s 2006 net premiums, primarily provide insurers with
    traditional life reinsurance. The Asia Pacific and
    Europe & South Africa operations, which represented,
    collectively, 29% of RGA’s 2006 net premiums, provide
    primarily traditional life and critical illness reinsurance and,
    to a lesser extent, financial reinsurance. Traditional life
    reinsurance pays upon the death of the insured and critical
    illness coverage provides a benefit upon the diagnosis of a
    pre-defined illness.

Corporate &
    Other

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, various

start-up

entities, including MetLife Bank, National Association
    (“MetLife Bank” or “MetLife Bank, N.A.”), a
    national bank, and run-off entities, as well as interest expense
    related to the majority of our outstanding debt and expenses
    associated with certain legal proceedings and income tax audit
    issues. Corporate & Other also includes the elimination
    of all intersegment amounts, which generally relate to
    intersegment loans, which bear interest rates commensurate with
    related borrowings, as well as intersegment transactions.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined
    amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when
    a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes
    disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to
    provide for future annuity payments. We compute the amounts for
    actuarial liabilities reported in our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

The liability for future policy benefits for participating
    traditional life insurance is the net level reserve using the
    policy’s guaranteed mortality rates and the dividend fund
    interest rate or nonforfeiture interest rate, as applicable. We
    amortize deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) in
    relation to the product’s estimated gross margins.

In establishing actuarial liabilities for certain other
    insurance contracts, we distinguish between short duration and
    long duration contracts. Short duration contracts generally
    arise from the property and casualty business. The actuarial
    liability for short duration contracts consists of gross
    unearned premiums as of the valuation date and the discounted
    amount of the future payments on pending and approved claims as
    of the valuation date. Long duration contracts consist of:

•

guaranteed renewable term life;

•

non-participating whole life;

•

individual disability;

•

group life, dental and disability; and

•

LTC contracts.

We determine actuarial liabilities for long duration contracts
    using assumptions based on experience, plus a margin for adverse
    deviation for these policies.



Where they exist, we amortize DAC, including value of business
    acquired (“VOBA”), in relation to the associated gross
    margins or premium.

Effective January 1, 2007, certain group life, dental and
    disability contracts will be reclassified as short duration due
    to the new guidance issued under Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Future Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements” for further information.

Liabilities for investment-type and universal life-type products
    primarily consist of policyholders’ account balances.
    Investment-type products include individual annuity contracts in
    the accumulation phase and certain group pension contracts that
    have limited or no mortality risk. Universal life-type products
    consist of universal and variable life contracts and contain
    group pension contracts. For universal life-type contracts with
    front-end loads, we defer the charge and amortize the unearned
    revenue using the product’s estimated gross profits. We
    amortize DAC on investment-type and universal life-type
    contracts in relation to estimated gross profits.

Limited pay contracts primarily consist of single premium
    immediate individual annuities, structured settlement annuities
    and certain group pension annuities. Actuarial liabilities for
    limited pay contracts are equal to the present value of future
    benefit payments and related expenses less the present value of
    future net premiums plus premium deficiency reserves, if any.
    For limited pay contracts, we also defer the excess of the gross
    premium over the net premium and recognize such excess into
    income in a constant relationship with insurance in-force for
    life insurance contracts and in relation to anticipated future
    benefit payments for annuity contracts. We amortize DAC for
    limited pay contracts over the premium payment period.

We also establish actuarial liabilities for future policy
    benefits (associated with base policies and riders, unearned
    mortality charges and future disability benefits), for other
    policyholder liabilities (associated with unearned revenues and
    claims payable) and for unearned revenue (the unamortized
    portion of front-end loads charged). We also establish
    liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees
    relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies.

The Auto & Home segment establishes actuarial
    liabilities to account for the estimated ultimate costs of
    losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been
    reported but not yet settled, and claims incurred but not
    reported. It bases unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on:

•

case estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted
    in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations;

•

estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past
    experience;

•

estimates of losses on insurance assumed primarily from
    involuntary market mechanisms; and

•

estimates of future expenses to be incurred in settlement of
    claims.

For the Auto & Home segment, we deduct estimated
    amounts of salvage and subrogation from unpaid losses and loss
    adjustment expenses. Implicit in all these estimates are
    underlying assumptions about rates of inflation because we
    determine all estimates using expected amounts to be paid. We
    derive estimates for the development of reported claims and for
    incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development
    for each line of business. Similarly, we derive estimates of
    unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship
    of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business.
    We anticipate ultimate recoveries from salvage and subrogation
    principally on the basis of historical recovery patterns. We
    calculate and record a single best estimate liability, in
    conformance with GAAP, for reported losses and for incurred but
    not reported losses. We aggregate these estimates to form the
    liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.

Pursuant to state insurance laws, the Holding Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries establish statutory reserves, reported as
    liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective
    policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts
    sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken
    together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed
    rates. Statutory reserves generally differ from actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits determined using GAAP.



The New York Insurance Law and regulations require certain
    MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of
    Insurance (the “Superintendent”) or other state
    insurance departments, with each annual report, an opinion and
    memorandum of a “qualified actuary” that the statutory
    reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of
    specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such
    statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate
    provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to these
    obligations. See “— Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve
    Sufficiency Analysis.”

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of its actuarial
    liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts we will
    ultimately pay with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and
    the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when payments may not occur until well into the
    future.

However, we believe our actuarial liabilities for future
    benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to
    be paid to policyholders. We periodically review our estimates
    of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
    with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
    permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
    expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
    development of actuarial liabilities.

We have experienced, and will likely in the future experience,
    catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism that may have
    an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms,
    earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather
    (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards) and
    fires. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence,
    timing, severity or amount of catastrophes and acts of
    terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and
    non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils.

Underwriting
    and Pricing

Institutional,
    Individual and International

Our underwriting for the Institutional and Individual segments
    involves an evaluation of applications for life, disability,
    dental, critical illness, retirement & savings, and LTC
    insurance products and services by a professional staff of
    underwriters and actuaries, who determine the type and the
    amount of risk that we are willing to accept. Within the
    International segment, similar products described above are
    offered to individual and institutional customers, as well as
    credit insurance and in a limited number of countries major
    medical products are offered. We employ detailed underwriting
    policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the
    underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks before issuing
    policies to qualified applicants or groups.

Individual underwriting considers not only an applicant’s
    medical history, but also other factors such as financial
    profiles, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and
    tobacco use. Our group underwriters generally evaluate the risk
    characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with
    certain voluntary products, employees may be underwritten on an
    individual basis. Generally, we are not obligated to accept any
    risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or group of
    policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for coverage
    are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is not
    issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined and
    approved for underwriting. We generally perform our own
    underwriting; however, certain policies are reviewed by
    intermediaries under strict guidelines established by us.

To maintain high standards of underwriting quality and
    consistency, we engage in a multi-level series of ongoing
    internal underwriting audits, and are subject to external audits
    by our reinsurers, at both our remote underwriting offices and
    our corporate underwriting office.

We have established senior level oversight of the underwriting
    process that facilitates quality sales and serving the needs of
    our customers, while supporting our financial strength and
    business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting,
    mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in
    our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and
    establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and
    strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer,
    the agent and us.



Pricing for the Institutional, Individual and International
    segments reflects our insurance underwriting standards. Product
    pricing of insurance products is based on the expected payout of
    benefits calculated through the use of assumptions for
    mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and investment
    returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors, such as
    inflation. Product specifications are designed to mitigate the
    risks of greater than expected mortality, and we periodically
    monitor mortality and morbidity assumptions. Investment-oriented
    products are priced based on various factors, which may include
    investment return, expenses, persistency and optionality.

Unique to the Institutional segment’s, and the
    institutional business sold in the International segment,
    pricing is experience rated. We employ both prospective and
    retrospective experience rating. Prospective experience rating
    involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of
    determining future premium rates. Retrospective experience
    rating involves the evaluation of past experience for the
    purpose of determining the actual cost of providing insurance
    for the customer for the period of time in question.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. Decisions are
    based on established actuarial pricing and risk selection
    principles to ensure that our underwriting and pricing
    guidelines are appropriate.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six
    principal aspects:

•

evaluating potential worksite marketing employer accounts and
    independent agencies;

•

establishing guidelines for the binding of risks;

•

reviewing coverage bound by agents;

•

underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis,
    presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority;

•

pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable
    Auto & Home to issue a policy within our
    guidelines; and

•

ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates
    commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of
    Auto & Home’s distribution channels, as well as in
    our Institutional segment, have binding authority for risks
    which fall within Auto & Home’s published
    underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting
    guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting
    department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call
    the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the
    risk themselves. In most states, Auto & Home generally
    has the right within a specified period (usually the first
    60 days) to cancel any policy.

Auto & Home establishes prices for its major lines of
    insurance based on its proprietary database, rather than relying
    on rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in
    part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The
    pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account,
    among other things, the expected frequency and severity of
    losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of
    acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and
    other administrative and overhead costs), competitive factors
    and profit considerations.

The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include
    characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and
    model or construction type, characteristics of insureds, such as
    driving record and loss experience, and the insured’s
    personal financial management. Auto & Home’s
    ability to set and change rates is subject to regulatory
    oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state,
    Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is
    required to write or share the cost of private passenger
    automobile insurance for higher risk individuals who would
    otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This
    “involuntary” market, also called the “shared
    market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations
    of each state, and policies written in this market are generally
    written at rates higher than standard rates.



Reinsurance

Reinsurance is written on a facultative basis or an automatic
    treaty basis. Facultative reinsurance is individually
    underwritten by the reinsurer for each policy to be reinsured.
    Factors considered in underwriting facultative reinsurance are
    medical history, impairments, employment, hobbies and financial
    information. An automatic reinsurance treaty provides that risks
    will be ceded on specified blocks of business where the
    underlying policies meet the ceding company’s underwriting
    criteria. In contrast to facultative reinsurance, the reinsurer
    does not approve each individual risk. Automatic reinsurance
    treaties generally provide that the reinsurer will be liable for
    a portion of the risk associated with specified policies written
    by the ceding company. Factors considered in underwriting
    automatic reinsurance are the product’s underwriting,
    pricing, distribution and optionality, as well as the ceding
    company’s retention and financial strength.

Reinsurance
    Activity

In addition to the activity of the Reinsurance segment, which
    assumes insurance risk from other insurers, we cede premiums to
    other insurers under various agreements that cover individual
    risks, group risks or defined blocks of business, on a
    coinsurance, yearly renewable term, excess or catastrophe excess
    basis. These reinsurance agreements spread the risk and minimize
    the effect of losses. The amount of each risk retained by us
    depends on our evaluation of the specific risk, subject, in
    certain circumstances, to maximum limits based on the
    characteristics of coverages. We also cede first dollar
    mortality risk under certain contracts. We obtain reinsurance
    when capital requirements and the economic terms of the
    reinsurance make it appropriate to do so. Within the Reinsurance
    segment, RGA utilizes retrocessional reinsurance treaties as
    part of its overall mortality risk management program. In the
    normal course of business, RGA seeks to limit its exposure to
    loss on any single insured and to recover a portion of benefits
    paid by ceding reinsurance to other insurance enterprises or
    retrocessionaires under excess coverage and coinsurance
    contracts. Additionally, RGA systematically reduces its
    retention on certain treaties utilizing a number of retrocession
    arrangements whereby certain business in-force is retroceded on
    an automatic or facultative basis. RGA also retrocedes most of
    its financial reinsurance business to other insurance companies
    to alleviate statutory capital requirements created by this
    business.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer
    agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event the
    claim is paid. However, we remain liable to our policyholders
    with respect to ceded insurance if any reinsurer fails to meet
    the obligations assumed by it. Since we bear the risk of
    nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we cede reinsurance
    to well-capitalized, highly rated reinsurers. Within the
    Reinsurance segment, RGA has never experienced a material
    default in connection with retrocession arrangements, nor has it
    experienced any material difficulty in collecting claims
    recoverable from retrocessionaires; however, no assurance can be
    given as to the future performance of such retrocessionaires or
    as to the recoverability of any such claims.

Individual

Our life insurance operations participate in reinsurance
    activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large
    risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We
    have historically reinsured the mortality risk on new individual
    life insurance policies primarily on an excess of retention
    basis or a quota share basis. Until 2005, we reinsured up to 90%
    of the mortality risk for all new individual life insurance
    policies that we wrote through our various franchises. This
    practice was initiated by the different franchises for different
    products starting at various points in time between 1992 and
    2000. During 2005, we changed our retention practices for
    certain individual life insurance policies. Amounts reinsured in
    prior years remain reinsured under the original reinsurance;
    however, under the new retention guidelines, we reinsure up to
    90% of the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most
    new individual life insurance policies that we write through our
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention strategy remained unchanged. On a case by case basis,
    we may retain up to $25 million per life on single life
    individual policies and $30 million per life on
    survivorship individual policies and reinsure 100% of amounts in
    excess of our retention limits. We evaluate our reinsurance
    programs routinely and may increase or decrease our retention at
    any time. In addition, we reinsure a significant portion of the
    mortality risk on our individual universal life policies issued
    since 1983. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an
    automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with
    specific characteristics.



In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, we
    reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We
    routinely reinsure certain classes of risks in order to limit
    our exposure to particular travel, avocation and lifestyle
    hazards. We have exposure to catastrophes, which could
    contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of
    operations. We use excess of retention and quota share
    reinsurance arrangements to provide greater diversification of
    risk and minimize exposure to larger risks.

We reinsure our business through a diversified group of
    reinsurers. No single unaffiliated reinsurer has a material
    obligation to us, nor is our business substantially dependent
    upon any reinsurance contracts. We are contingently liable with
    respect to ceded reinsurance should any reinsurer be unable to
    meet its obligations under these agreements.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home purchases reinsurance to control our
    exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to
    protect statutory surplus. Auto & Home cedes to
    reinsurers a portion of losses and cedes premiums based upon the
    risk and exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance.

To control our exposure to large property and casualty losses,
    Auto & Home utilizes property catastrophe, casualty,
    and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”)
    reinsures its workers’ compensation business through a 100%
    quota-share reinsurance agreement and is included within
    Corporate & Other as a run-off business.

Regulation

Insurance
    Regulation

Metropolitan Life is licensed to transact insurance business in,
    and is subject to regulation and supervision by, all
    50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
    U.S. Virgin Islands and Canada. Each of the Holding
    Company’s other insurance subsidiaries is licensed and
    regulated in all U.S. and international jurisdictions where
    they conduct insurance business. The extent of such regulation
    varies, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations
    governing the financial aspects of insurers, including standards
    of solvency, statutory reserves, reinsurance and capital
    adequacy, and the business conduct of insurers. In addition,
    statutes and regulations usually require the licensing of
    insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and
    certain other related materials and, for certain lines of
    insurance, the approval of rates. Such statutes and regulations
    also prescribe the permitted types and concentration of
    investments. The New York Insurance Law limits both the amounts
    of agent compensation throughout the U.S., as well as the sales
    commissions and certain other marketing expenses that may be
    incurred in connection with the sale of life insurance policies
    and annuity contracts.

The Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are each
    required to file reports, generally including detailed annual
    financial statements, with insurance regulatory authorities in
    each of the jurisdictions in which they do business, and their
    operations and accounts are subject to periodic examination by
    such authorities. These subsidiaries must also file, and in many
    jurisdictions and in some lines of insurance obtain regulatory
    approval for, rules, rates and forms relating to the insurance
    written in the jurisdictions in which they operate.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) has established a program of accrediting
    state insurance departments. NAIC accreditation permits
    accredited states to conduct periodic examinations of insurers
    domiciled in such states. NAIC-accredited states will not accept
    reports of examination of insurers from unaccredited states,
    except under limited circumstances. As a direct result, insurers
    domiciled in unaccredited states may be subject to financial
    examination by accredited states in which they are licensed, in
    addition to any examinations conducted by their domiciliary
    states. The New York State Department of Insurance (the
    “Department”), Metropolitan Life’s principal
    insurance regulator, has not received its accreditation as a
    result of the New York legislature’s failure to adopt
    certain model NAIC laws. We do not believe that the absence of
    this accreditation will have a significant impact upon our
    ability to conduct our insurance businesses.



State and federal insurance and securities regulatory
    authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and
    attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding
    compliance by the Holding Company and its insurance subsidiaries
    with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations
    regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities
    businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and takes
    corrective action when warranted. See “Legal
    Proceedings.”

Holding Company Regulation.

The Holding
    Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation
    under the insurance holding company laws of various
    jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and
    regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but
    generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that
    are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register
    with state regulatory authorities and to file with those
    authorities certain reports, including information concerning
    their capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
    intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
    companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its
    affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company.” The New York Insurance Law and the regulations
    thereunder also restrict the aggregate amount of investments
    Metropolitan Life may make in non-life insurance subsidiaries,
    and provide for detailed periodic reporting on subsidiaries.

Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.

Most of the jurisdictions in which
    the Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are admitted
    to transact business require life and property and casualty
    insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate
    in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain
    contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets.

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against
    the Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries have not been
    material. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund
    assessments that we consider adequate for assessments with
    respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency
    proceedings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Insolvency Assessments.”

Statutory Insurance Examination.

As part of
    their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments
    conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records,
    accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
    states. During the three-year period ended December 31,
    2006, MetLife, Inc. has not received any material adverse
    findings resulting from state insurance department examinations
    of its insurance subsidiaries conducted during this three-year
    period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to Metropolitan
    Life’s, New England Life Insurance Company’s
    (“New England Life”) or General American’s sales
    of individual life insurance policies or annuities. Over the
    past several years, these and a number of investigations by
    other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments
    and certain other relief. We may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner.

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.

Annually, MetLife, Inc.’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct an
    analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each
    case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states
    that the statutory reserves, when considered in light of the
    assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and
    sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations
    and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot
    be provided, the insurer must set up additional reserves by
    moving funds from surplus. Since inception of this requirement,
    MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries which are required
    by their states of domicile to provide these opinions have
    provided such opinions without qualifications.

Surplus and Capital.

MetLife, Inc.’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision
    of the regulators in each jurisdiction in which they are
    licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary
    authority, in connection with the continued licensing of these
    insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit sales to



policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine
    that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or
    capital or that the further transaction of business will be
    hazardous to policyholders. See “— Risk-Based
    Capital.”

Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”).

Each of
    MetLife, Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject
    to certain RBC requirements and reports their RBC based on a
    formula calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium
    and statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the
    risk characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk,
    insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk. The
    formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify
    possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of
    initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank
    insurers generally. As of the date of the most recent statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the total
    adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of
    the most recent referenced RBC-based amount calculated at
    December 31, 2006. See “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Capital.”

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001. Codification was
    intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to
    state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting
    principles continue to be established by individual state laws
    and permitted practices. The Department has adopted Codification
    with certain modifications for the preparation of statutory
    financial statements of insurance companies domiciled in New
    York. Modifications by the various state insurance departments
    may impact the effect of Codification on the statutory capital
    and surplus of MetLife Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries.

Regulation of Investments.

Each of MetLife,
    Inc.’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to state
    laws and regulations that require diversification of its
    investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in
    certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed
    income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments,
    and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and
    regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory
    limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of
    measuring surplus, and, in some instances, would require
    divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that
    the investments made by each of the Holding Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with
    such regulations at December 31, 2006.

Federal Initiatives.

Although the federal
    government generally does not directly regulate the insurance
    business, federal initiatives often have an impact on our
    business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal
    measures are proposed which may significantly affect the
    insurance business; the potential for this resides primarily in
    the tax-writing committees. At the present time, we do not know
    of any federal legislative initiatives that, if enacted, would
    adversely impact our business, results of operations or
    financial condition.

Legislative Developments.

On August 17,
    2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. This act is considered to be the
    most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”) on September 2, 1974. The provisions of
    the PPA may have a significant impact on demand for pension,
    retirement savings, and lifestyle protection products in both
    the institutional and retail markets. This legislation, while
    not immediate, may have a positive impact on the life insurance
    and financial services industries in the future.

On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed into law the
    Deficit Reduction Act which, among other things, creates a
    national LTC partnership program. States are now implementing
    the partnership program. While it is possible that the
    implementation of this program could have a positive effect on
    our LTC business, we can give no assurance that this will be the
    case.

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what
    legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any
    such legislation on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Broker-Dealer
    and Securities Regulation

Some of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries and their
    activities in offering and selling variable insurance products
    are subject to extensive regulation under the federal securities
    laws administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”). These subsidiaries issue variable
    annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies through
    separate accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment



Company Act of 1940. Each registered separate account is
    generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act of 1940. In addition, the variable annuity contracts
    and variable life insurance policies issued by the separate
    accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of
    1933. Other subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as
    broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
    are members of, and subject to, regulation by NASD. Further,
    some of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries are registered
    as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment
    Advisers Act of 1940, and are also registered as investment
    advisers in various states, as applicable. Certain variable
    contract separate accounts sponsored by the Holding
    Company’s subsidiaries are exempt from registration, but
    may be subject to other provisions of the federal securities
    laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and NASD
    from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations
    regarding compliance by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries
    with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate
    with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action
    when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to protect investors in the securities markets and
    generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and
    enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the
    conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and
    regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and
    regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide
    investment advisory services, offer products similar to those
    described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental
    Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to
    extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also
    the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities
    and costs in connection with any required remediation of such
    properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies
    that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities.
    We routinely have environmental assessments performed with
    respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real
    property to be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide
    assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not
    arise. However, based on information currently available to
    management, management believes that any costs associated with
    compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any
    remediation of such properties will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations or financial
    condition.

ERISA
    Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit
    plans that are subject to ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities
    are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code,
    including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must
    perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan
    participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA
    and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to
    engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain
    relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable
    provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by
    the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”).

In

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris
    Trust and Savings Bank (1993)

, the U.S. Supreme Court
    held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to
    satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group
    annuity general account contract are “plan assets.”
    Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary
    obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform
    their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants
    and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of
    Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an
    insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer’s general
    account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which
    assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of
    ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a
    policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998
    (“Transition Policy”). No person will generally be
    liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to
    July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance
    company general account assets constitute plan assets. An
    insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general
    account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after
    December 31,



1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary obligations under
    ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so
    that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be
    considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These
    requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the
    employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must
    permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day
    notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s
    option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance
    (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a
    book value payment of such amount in annual installments with
    interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to
    ensure compliance with these regulations.

Financial
    Holding Company Regulation

Regulatory Agencies.

In connection with its
    acquisition of a federally-chartered commercial bank, the
    Holding Company became a bank holding company and financial
    holding company on February 28, 2001. As such, the Holding
    Company is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company
    Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to
    inspection, examination, and supervision by the Board of
    Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”).
    In addition, the Holding Company’s banking subsidiary is
    subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and
    secondarily by the FRB and the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation.

Financial Holding Company Activities.

As a
    financial holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and
    investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to
    those that are “financial” in nature or
    “incidental” or “complementary” to such
    financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature
    include securities underwriting, dealing and market making,
    sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance
    underwriting and agency, merchant banking and activities that
    the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking. In
    addition, under the insurance company investment portfolio
    provision of the GLB Act, financial holding companies are
    authorized to make investments in other financial and
    non-financial companies, through their insurance subsidiaries,
    that are in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
    with state insurance law, provided the financial holding company
    does not routinely manage or operate such companies except as
    may be necessary to obtain a reasonable return on investment.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies —
    Capital.

MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository
    institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, are subject to risk-based
    and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking
    regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies.
    The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to
    take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to
    institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At
    December 31, 2006, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank were in
    compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Consumer Protection
    Laws.

Numerous other federal and state laws also
    affect the Holding Company’s and MetLife Bank’s
    earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer
    protection laws. The GLB Act included consumer privacy
    provisions that, among other things, require disclosure of a
    financial institution’s privacy policy to customers. In
    addition, these provisions permit states to adopt more extensive
    privacy protections through legislation or regulation.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Change of
    Control.

Because MetLife, Inc. is a
    “financial holding company” and “bank holding
    company” under the federal banking laws, no person may
    acquire control of MetLife, Inc. without the prior approval of
    the FRB. A change of control is conclusively presumed upon
    acquisitions of 25% or more of any class of voting securities
    and rebuttably presumed upon acquisitions of 10% or more of any
    class of voting securities. Further, as a result of MetLife,
    Inc.’s ownership of MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC
    would be required in connection with a change of control
    (generally presumed upon the acquisition of 10% or more of any
    class of voting securities) of MetLife, Inc.



Competition

Our management believes that competition faced by our business
    segments is based on a number of factors, including service,
    product features, scale, price, financial strength,
    claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, ebusiness capabilities
    and name recognition. It competes with a large number of other
    insurers, as well as non-insurance financial services companies,
    such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual
    consumers, employer and other group customers and agents and
    other distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of
    these companies offer a broader array of products, have more
    competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurers, have
    higher claims paying ability ratings. Some may also have greater
    financial resources with which to compete.

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales
    representatives primarily on the basis of our financial
    position, support services and compensation and product
    features. See “— Individual — Marketing
    and Distribution.” We continue to undertake several
    initiatives to grow our career agency force while continuing to
    enhance the efficiency and production of our existing sales
    force. We cannot provide assurance that these initiatives will
    succeed in attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of
    individual insurance, annuities and investment products and our
    results of operations and financial position could be materially
    adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and
    retaining agents.

Many of our insurance products, particularly those offered by
    our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually and,
    accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able
    to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

The U.S. Congress periodically considers reforms to the
    nation’s healthcare system. While we offer non-medical
    health insurance products (such as group dental insurance, LTC
    and disability insurance), we generally do not offer medical
    indemnity products or managed care products, and, accordingly,
    we do not expect to be directly affected by such proposals to
    any significant degree. However, the uncertain environment
    resulting from healthcare reform could cause group health
    insurance providers to enter some of the markets in which we do
    business, thereby increasing competition. Increasing healthcare
    costs are causing consumers to seek alternative financial
    protection products. As a result, we have entered the fixed
    benefit critical illness insurance marketplace. Changes to the
    healthcare system may make this market more or less attractive
    in the future.

Rating
    Stability Indicators

Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable” or “negative”
    to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals
    which, if continued, may lead to a rating change. These factors
    may be internal to the issuer, such as a changing profitability
    profile, or may be brought about by changes in the
    industry’s landscape through new competition, regulation or
    technological transformation. A rating may have a
    “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not
    expected to change. A “stable” rating does not
    preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time,
    without notice.

The foregoing insurer financial strength ratings reflect each
    rating agency’s opinion of Metropolitan Life and the
    Holding Company’s other insurance subsidiaries’
    financial characteristics with respect to their ability to pay
    obligations under insurance policies and contracts in accordance
    with their terms, and are not evaluations directed toward the
    protection of investors in the Holding Company’s
    securities. Credit ratings are opinions of each agency with
    respect to specific securities and contractual financial
    obligations and the issuer’s ability and willingness to
    meet those obligations when due. Neither insurer financial
    strength nor credit ratings are statements of fact nor are they
    recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any security, contract
    or policy. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
    other rating.

A ratings downgrade (or the potential for such a downgrade) of
    Metropolitan Life or any of the Holding Company’s other
    insurance subsidiaries could potentially, among other things,
    increase the number of policies surrendered and withdrawals by
    policyholders of cash values from their policies, adversely
    affect relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents,
    wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services,
    negatively impact new sales, and adversely affect our ability to
    compete and thereby have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition.

Employees

At December 31, 2006, we had approximately 47,000
    employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are
    satisfactory.

We disclosed in Part I, Item 1 of our 2005 Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

filed with the SEC that we employed approximately 65,500
    employees. Included in this figure were certain agents who would
    not be considered employees under local statutes and regulations
    in foreign jurisdictions and certain other employees.
    Accordingly, we have revised the reported count of employees as
    of December 31, 2005, to approximately 46,000. We have
    modified the method we use to count employees, but our workforce
    composition has not changed.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Changes
    in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability

Some of our products, principally traditional whole life
    insurance, fixed annuities and GICs, expose us to the risk that
    changes in interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or
    the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay
    under the contracts in the Company’s general account and
    the rate of return we are able to earn on general account
    investments intended to support obligations under the contracts.
    Our spread is a key component of our net income.

As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be
    forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured
    or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our
    investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the
    fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with
    greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates,
    which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates
    can help offset decreases in investment margins on some
    products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be
    limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates
    and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset
    yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially
    become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an
    important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA and
    significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate
    amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected
    reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining
    interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be
    relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting
    in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium
    features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency,
    or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force
    from year to year, during a period when our new investments
    carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could
    also reduce our return on investments that do not support
    particular policy obligations. Accordingly, declining interest
    rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our
    profitability.



Our results in Taiwan are highly sensitive to interest rates and
    other related assumptions because of the sustained low interest
    rate environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate
    guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health
    contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of
    long-duration assets in the Taiwanese capital markets to match
    such long-duration liabilities. During the fourth quarter of
    2006, our Taiwanese operation recorded a loss recognition
    adjustment (in the form of accelerated DAC amortization) of
    $50 million, net of income tax, due, principally, to the
    continued low interest rate environment. The loss recognition
    testing that resulted in the charge during the fourth quarter of
    2006 used a current best estimate of Taiwanese interest rates of
    2.1% rising to 3.5% over the next ten years and a corresponding
    increase in related lapse rates. If interest rates and related
    lapse assumptions do not improve, notwithstanding other actions
    we may take to reduce the impact, current estimates of future
    loss recognition of as much as $250 million, net of income
    tax, could be recognized in our results of operations in one or
    more future periods and additional capital may be required to be
    contributed to the Taiwanese operation. The results of loss
    recognition testing for Taiwan are inherently uncertain given
    the use of various assumptions and the long-term nature of the
    liability, and therefore, can only be reliably estimated within
    broad ranges which may vary significantly in future periods.

Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect
    our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest
    rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the
    assets in the Company’s general account with higher
    yielding assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates
    necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We,
    therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower
    profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of
    existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy
    loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as
    policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as
    interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows
    requiring that we sell invested assets at a time when the prices
    of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in market
    interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses.
    Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to
    accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would
    increase our current expenses and reduce net income. An increase
    in market interest rates could also have a material adverse
    effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by
    decreasing the fair values of the fixed income securities that
    comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio.

Industry
    Trends Could Adversely Affect the Profitability of Our
    Businesses

Our business segments continue to be influenced by a variety of
    trends that affect the insurance industry. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Results of
    Operations — Industry Trends.”

Financial Environment.

The current financial
    environment presents a challenge for the life insurance
    industry. The level of long-term interest rates and the shape of
    the yield curve can have a negative impact on the demand for and
    the profitability of spread-based products such as fixed
    annuities, GICs and universal life insurance. A flat or inverted
    yield curve and low long-term interest rates will be a concern
    until new money rates on corporate bonds are higher than overall
    life insurer investment portfolio yields. Recent volatile equity
    market performance has also presented challenges for life
    insurers, as fee revenue from variable annuities and pension
    products is tied to separate account balances, which reflect
    equity market performance. Also, variable annuity product demand
    often mirrors consumer demand for equity market investments. See
    “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base. See
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability” and
    “Business — Competition.”



Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and
    capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators
    have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several
    markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products. See “— Our
    Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth” and “Business —
    Regulation — Insurance Regulation.”

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the PPA. The PPA is a comprehensive reform
    of defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules. Defined
    benefit funding reforms may result in an increase in the shift
    from defined benefit to defined contribution programs and
    increased defined benefit plan freezes and terminations. These
    changes may adversely affect our business.

A
    Decline in Equity Markets or an Increase in Volatility in Equity
    Markets May Adversely Affect Sales of Our Investment Products
    and Our Profitability

Significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations in three principal ways.

First, market downturns and volatility may discourage purchases
    of separate account products, such as variable annuities,
    variable life insurance and mutual funds that have returns
    linked to the performance of the equity markets and may cause
    some of our existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce
    investments in those products.

Second, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a
    material adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our
    savings and investment products and services. Because these
    products and services depend on fees related primarily to the
    value of assets under management, a decline in the equity
    markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the
    investment assets we manage. The retail annuity business in
    particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a
    sustained weakness in the markets will decrease revenues and
    earnings in variable annuity products.

Third, we provide certain guarantees within some of our products
    that protect policyholders against significant downturns in the
    equity markets. For example, we offer variable annuity products
    with guaranteed features, such as minimum death and withdrawal
    benefits. These guarantees may be more costly than expected in
    volatile or declining equity market conditions, causing us to
    increase liabilities for future policy benefits, negatively
    affecting net income.

The
    Performance of Our Investments Depends on Conditions that Are
    Outside Our Control, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from
    Period to Period

The performance of our investment portfolio depends in part upon
    the level of and changes in interest rates, equity prices, real
    estate values, the performance of the economy in general, the
    performance of the specific obligors included in our portfolio
    and other factors that are beyond our control. Changes in these
    factors can affect our net investment income in any period, and
    such changes can be substantial.

We invest a portion of our invested assets in pooled investment
    funds that make private equity investments. The amount and
    timing of income from such investment funds tend to be uneven as
    a result of the performance of the underlying private equity
    investments, which can be difficult to predict, as well as the
    timing of distributions from the funds, which depends on
    particular events relating to the underlying investments, as
    well as the funds’ schedules for making distributions and
    their needs for cash. As a result, the amount of income that we
    record from these investments can vary substantially from
    quarter to quarter.

Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability

Our business segments are subject to intense competition. We
    believe that this competition is based on a number of factors,
    including service, product features, scale, price, financial
    strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurers, as well as



non-insurance financial services companies, such as banks,
    broker-dealers and asset managers, for individual consumers,
    employers and other group customers and agents and other
    distributors of insurance and investment products. Some of these
    companies offer a broader array of products, have more
    competitive pricing or, with respect to other insurers, have
    higher claims paying ability ratings. Some may also have greater
    financial resources with which to compete. National banks, which
    may sell annuity products of life insurers in some
    circumstances, also have pre-existing customer bases for
    financial services products.

Many of our insurance products, particularly those offered by
    our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually, and,
    accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able
    to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

In addition, the investment management and securities brokerage
    businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually
    attract new entrants. Many of our competitors in these
    businesses offer a broader array of investment products and
    services and are better known than us as sellers of annuities
    and other investment products. See “Business —
    Competition.”

We May
    be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
    Products

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. We compete with other insurers for sales
    representatives primarily on the basis of our financial
    position, support services and compensation and product
    features. We continue to undertake several initiatives to grow
    our career agency force while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents. See “Business — Competition.”

Differences
    Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving
    Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Results

Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our
    actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we
    use in setting prices for our products and establishing
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Our
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are
    established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will
    need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance
    and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on
    many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to
    be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of
    the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of
    benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the
    assets we purchase with the premiums we receive. We establish
    liabilities for property and casualty claims and benefits based
    on assumptions and estimates of damages and liabilities
    incurred. To the extent that actual claims experience is less
    favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in
    establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase
    our liabilities.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for
    future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely
    the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our
    liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts,
    particularly when those payments may not occur until well into
    the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on
    changes in the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as
    well as our actual experience. We charge or credit changes in
    our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are
    established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally
    established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we
    must increase them. Such increases could affect earnings
    negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Our
    Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to
    Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Business

Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires,
    among other things, policies and procedures to record properly
    and verify a large number of transactions and events. We have
    devoted significant resources to



develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect
    to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies
    and procedures may not be fully effective. Many of our methods
    for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of
    observed historical market behavior or statistics based on
    historical models. As a result, these methods may not predict
    future exposures, which could be significantly greater than our
    historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods
    depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets,
    clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is
    publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This
    information may not always be accurate, complete,

up-to-date

or properly evaluated. See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Catastrophes
    May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and
    Reinsurance Availability

Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of
    catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that
    causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics
    have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the
    likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be
    predicted. The effectiveness of external parties, including
    governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating
    the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material
    impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group insurance
    operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one
    or more of our group insurance customers could cause a
    significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These
    events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could
    also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will
    likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may
    have a material adverse impact on the business, results of
    operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home
    segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to
    manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility
    management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not
    eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
    tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow,
    freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires, and man-made
    events such as terrorist attacks. Historically, substantially
    all of our catastrophe-related claims have related to homeowners
    coverages. However, catastrophes may also affect other
    Auto & Home coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot
    predict the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Impact of
    Hurricanes” and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our
    homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include
    coastal sections of the northeastern United States (including
    lower New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts),
    the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana)
    and Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure, primarily
    along the New Madrid fault line in the central United States and
    in the Pacific Northwest. Losses incurred by Auto &
    Home from all catastrophes, net of reinsurance but before tax,
    were $128 million, $286 million and $189 million
    in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The 2006 and 2005 numbers
    include loss and loss adjustment expenses and reinstatement and
    additional reinsurance-related premiums which were caused by the
    magnitude of reinsurance recoverables.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
    the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, pandemics,
    hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce
    significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are
    heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made
    catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our
    financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could
    materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial
    condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial
    condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability
    of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new
    business could also be affected. It is possible that increases
    in the value and geographic concentration of insured property
    and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of
    claims from catastrophic events in the future.

Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we
    establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only
    after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We
    cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will
    be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to
    time, states have passed



legislation that has the effect of limiting the ability of
    insurers to manage risk, such as legislation restricting an
    insurer’s ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas.
    While we attempt to limit our exposure to acceptable levels,
    subject to restrictions imposed by insurance regulatory
    authorities, a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic
    events could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our
    property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in
    part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may
    not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future.
    See “— Reinsurance May Not Be Available,
    Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.”

A
    Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or
    Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Financial strength ratings, which various Nationally Recognized
    Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) publish as
    indicators of an insurance company’s ability to meet
    contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to
    maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to
    market our products and our competitive position. See
    “Business — Company Ratings —
    Insurer Financial Strength Ratings.”

Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including:

•

reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other
    investment products;

•

adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and
    independent sales intermediaries;

•

materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders
    and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;

•

requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and
    services to remain competitive; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at
    reasonable prices or at all.

In addition to the financial strength ratings of the Holding
    Company’s insurance subsidiaries, various NRSROs also
    publish credit ratings for MetLife, Inc. and several of its
    subsidiaries. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt
    issuer’s ability to meet the terms of the debt obligations
    in a timely manner. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Credit Ratings.” A downgrade in our
    credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations in many ways,
    including increasing the cost of borrowing or adversely
    affecting our relationships with credit counterparties.

As a result of the additional securities that we issued to
    finance a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of
    Travelers, our leverage ratio increased moderately, but returned
    to pre-acquisition levels by December 31, 2006.

Rating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors, some
    of which relate to general economic conditions and circumstances
    outside of our control. In addition, rating agencies may employ
    different models and formulas to assess our financial strength
    and creditworthiness, and may alter these models from time to
    time at their discretion. We cannot predict what actions rating
    agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to
    the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our
    business.

If our
    Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus
    Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC and VOBA Vary
    Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization

and/or

Impair the DAC and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results
    of Operations or Financial Condition

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and
    renewal business. Those costs that vary with and are primarily
    related to the production of new and renewal business are
    deferred and referred to as DAC. The recovery of DAC is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    The amount of future profit is dependent principally on
    investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest
    crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance



counterparties and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment
    returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of
    such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into
    management’s estimates of gross profits, which generally
    are used to amortize such costs. If the estimates of gross
    profits were overstated, then the amortization of such costs
    would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is
    known and would result in a charge to income. Such adjustments
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition.

VOBA reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in
    a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion
    of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the
    right to receive future cash flows from the insurance and
    annuity contracts in-force at the acquisition date. VOBA is
    based on actuarially determined projections. Actual experience
    may vary from the projections. Revisions to estimates result in
    changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which
    the revisions are made and could result in an impairment and a
    charge to income. Also, as VOBA is amortized similarly to DAC,
    an acceleration of the amortization of VOBA would occur if the
    estimates of gross profits were overstated. Accordingly, the
    amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period in
    which the actual experience is known and would result in a
    charge to net income. Such adjustments could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

If the
    Travelers Business Does Not Perform Well, We May Be Required to
    Establish a Valuation Allowance Against the Deferred Income Tax
    Asset or to Recognize an Impairment of Our Goodwill, Established
    at the Acquisition, Which Could Adversely Affect our Results of
    Operations or Financial Condition

As a result of the acquisition of Travelers, we recognized net
    deferred income tax assets of $2.1 billion and established
    goodwill of $4.3 billion.

The deferred income tax asset was recorded upon acquisition as a
    result of an election made under the Internal Revenue Code
    Section 338. This election resulted in a

step-up

in
    tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon
    the Travelers acquisition. The realizability of the deferred
    income tax asset is assessed periodically by management. If,
    based on available information, it is more likely than not that
    the deferred income tax asset will not be realized, then a
    valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding
    charge to net income.

Goodwill is established as the excess of cost over the fair
    value of net assets acquired. We test goodwill at least annually
    for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon
    estimates of the fair value of the “reporting unit” to
    which the goodwill relates. The reporting unit is the operating
    segment, or a business one level below that operating segment if
    discrete financial information is prepared and regularly
    reviewed by management at that level. The fair value of the
    reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business.
    If it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired, we must
    write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a
    corresponding charge to net income. Such write downs could have
    a material adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial condition.

Defaults,
    Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Value of Our Fixed
    Maturity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our
    Earnings

We are subject to the risk that the issuers of the fixed
    maturity securities we own may default on principal and interest
    payments they owe us. At December 31, 2006, the fixed
    maturity securities of $243 billion in our investment
    portfolio represented 73% of our total cash and invested assets.
    The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate
    malfeasance or other events that adversely affect the issuers of
    these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity
    securities portfolio and our net earnings to decline and the
    default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment
    portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting particular
    issuers or securities could also have a similar effect. With
    economic uncertainty and increasing interest rates, credit
    quality of issuers could be adversely affected. Any event
    reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary
    basis could have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition.

Defaults
    on Our Mortgage and Consumer Loans May Adversely Affect Our
    Profitability

Our mortgage and consumer loan investments face default risk.
    Our mortgage and consumer loans are principally collateralized
    by commercial, agricultural and residential properties, as well
    as automobiles. At



December 31, 2006, our mortgage and consumer loan
    investments of $42.2 billion represented 12.7% of our total
    cash and invested assets. At December 31, 2006, loans that
    were either delinquent or in the process of foreclosure totaled
    less than 1% of our mortgage and consumer loan investments. The
    performance of our mortgage and consumer loan investments,
    however, may fluctuate in the future. In addition, substantially
    all of our mortgage loan investments have balloon payment
    maturities. An increase in the default rate of our mortgage and
    consumer loan investments could have a material adverse effect
    on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Some
    of Our Investments Are Relatively Illiquid

Our investments in privately placed fixed maturity securities,
    mortgage and consumer loans, and equity real estate, including
    real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests are relatively illiquid. These asset classes
    represented 25.6% of the carrying value of our total cash and
    invested assets as of December 31, 2006. If we require
    significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal
    cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner, be forced to sell them for less
    than we otherwise would have been able to realize, or both.

Fluctuations
    in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities
    Markets Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability

We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting
    from our holdings of

non-U.S. dollar

denominated securities and investments in foreign subsidiaries.
    If the currencies of the

non-U.S. dollar

denominated securities we hold in our investment portfolios
    decline against the U.S. dollar, our investment returns,
    and thus our profitability, may be adversely affected. Although
    we use foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to mitigate
    foreign currency exchange rate risk, we cannot provide assurance
    that these methods will be effective or that our counterparties
    will perform their obligations. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

From time to time, various emerging market countries have
    experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
    significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to
    foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in
    emerging markets.

We have matched substantially all of our foreign currency
    liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with assets denominated
    in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of
    currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results;
    however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of
    these results into our consolidated financial statements.
    Although we take certain actions to address this risk, foreign
    currency exchange rate fluctuation could materially adversely
    affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the
    failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability

Our international operations face political, legal, operational
    and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations.
    We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization
    or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls
    or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds
    from these operations out of the countries in which they operate
    or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or
    other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are,
    and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where
    these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we
    rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter
    labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and
    trade unions in some countries. If our business model is not
    successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of
    our investment in building and training the sales force in that
    country.

We are currently planning to expand our international operations
    in markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This
    may require considerable management time, as well as

start-up

expenses for market development before any significant revenues
    and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets
    may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in
    existing markets may be affected by local economic and market



conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not
    achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations
    may be negatively impacted.

The business we acquired from Travelers includes operations in
    several foreign countries, including Australia, Brazil,
    Argentina, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Poland, Japan and Hong
    Kong. See “Business — International.” Those
    operations, and operations in other new markets, are subject to
    the risks described above, as well as our unfamiliarity with the
    business, legal and regulatory environment in any of those
    countries.

In recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been
    challenging. In Argentina, we are principally engaged in the
    pension business. This business has incurred significant losses
    in recent years as a result of actions taken by the Argentinean
    government in response to a sovereign debt crisis in December
    2001. Further governmental or legal actions related to pension
    reform could impact our obligations to our customers and could
    result in future losses in our Argentinean operations.

See also “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding the
    impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.

Reinsurance
    May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us
    Against Losses

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    business segments. See
    “Business — Reinsurance Activity.” For
    example, we currently reinsure up to 90% of the mortality risk
    in excess of $1 million for most new individual life
    insurance policies that we write through our various franchises.
    While reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for
    the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing,
    market conditions beyond our control determine the availability
    and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business. In
    certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for business
    already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in the amount
    of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase
    in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in the amount
    of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we may be
    forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not
    be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms,
    which could adversely affect our ability to write future
    business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect
    to those policies we issue.

If the
    Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification
    Arrangements or to the Derivative Instruments We Use to Hedge
    Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed
    to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivative instruments
    to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general,
    reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
    policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us.
    Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers
    and indemnitors. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers
    will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that
    indemnitors will honor their obligations now or in the future or
    that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A
    reinsurer’s or indemnitor’s insolvency, inability or
    unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance
    agreements or indemnity agreements with us could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various
    business risks. We enter into a variety of derivative
    instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate and
    currency swaps with a number of counterparties. See
    “Business — Investments.” If our
    counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under
    these derivative instruments, our hedges of the related risk
    will be ineffective. Such failure could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our
    Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth

Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of
    insurance and other laws and regulations. State insurance laws
    regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and
    the Holding Company’s insurance



subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the
    states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they
    are licensed. Our

non-U.S. insurance

operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory
    authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and
    operate. See “Business — Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation.”

State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory
    authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among
    other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with
    statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;

•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through
    the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices,
    distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;

•

regulating advertising;

•

protecting privacy;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and
    solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and
    minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance
    policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions
    between affiliates; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.

State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess
    insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
    policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an
    assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have
    currently established for these potential liabilities may not be
    adequate. See “Business — Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and
    Similar Arrangements.”

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies
    and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have recently
    considered the need for regulations

and/or

laws
    to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of
    recent investigations of broker compensation in the State of New
    York and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC has adopted a
    Compensation Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing
    Model Act which, if adopted by the states, would require
    disclosure by agents or brokers to customers that insurers will
    compensate such agents or brokers for the placement of insurance
    and documented acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases
    where the customer also compensates the agent or broker. Several
    states have recently enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment.
    Some other states have considered other proposed requirements,
    also relating to disclosure rather than the regulation of the
    substance of compensation. We cannot predict how many states may
    promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative regulations or the
    extent to which these regulations may have a material adverse
    impact on our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly
    regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation
    and administrative policies in several areas can significantly
    and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include
    financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension
    regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In
    addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of
    insurance have been proposed.



These proposals include the National Insurance Act of 2006,
    which would permit an optional federal charter for insurers. We
    cannot predict whether this or other proposals will be adopted,
    or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such
    laws, could have on our business, financial condition or results
    of operations.

Our international operations are subject to regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is
    similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of
    our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate
    in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that
    affect their operations also may affect our business
    relationships with them and their ability to purchase or
    distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
    consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
    regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect
    compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations
    or audits of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries that could,
    if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot
    predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that
    could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the
    interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and
    statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in
    areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.

Litigation
    and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in the
    Insurance Business and May Result in Significant Financial
    Losses and Harm to Our Reputation

We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating
    our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our
    pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings
    specific to us and others generally applicable to business
    practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection
    with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may
    bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits
    alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or
    underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product
    design, disclosure, administration, additional premium charges
    for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of
    benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers.
    Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may
    seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and
    treble damages, and the damages claimed and the amount of any
    probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for
    substantial periods of time. See “Legal Proceedings”
    and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may be inherently impossible to ascertain with
    any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties can include how
    fact finders will view individually and in their totality
    documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness of
    witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and yearly basis, we review relevant information
    with respect to liabilities for litigation and contingencies to
    be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The
    review includes senior legal and financial personnel. Unless
    stated elsewhere herein, estimates of possible additional losses
    or ranges of loss for particular matters cannot in the ordinary
    course be made with a reasonable degree of certainty. See
    “Legal Proceedings” and Note 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Liabilities are established
    when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
    of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of the matters noted in “Legal
    Proceedings” and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. It is possible that some of the matters
    could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or
    establish liabilities in amounts that could not be estimated as
    of December 31, 2006.

Metropolitan Life and its affiliates are currently defendants in
    hundreds of lawsuits raising allegations of improper marketing
    and sales of individual life insurance policies or annuities.
    These lawsuits are generally referred to as “sales
    practices claims.” Metropolitan Life is also a defendant in
    thousands of lawsuits seeking compensatory



and punitive damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by
    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products. These
    lawsuits principally have been based upon allegations relating
    to certain research, publication and other activities of one or
    more of Metropolitan Life’s employees during the period
    from the 1920’s through approximately the 1950’s and
    have alleged that Metropolitan Life learned or should have
    learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among
    other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those
    health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters
    may be commenced in the future. The ability of Metropolitan Life
    to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to
    considerable uncertainty due to numerous factors. The
    availability of data is limited and it is difficult to predict
    with any certainty numerous variables that can affect liability
    estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to
    resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease, the
    jurisdiction of claims filed, tort reform efforts and the impact
    of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. The
    number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate
    amount of any liability that Metropolitan Life may ultimately
    incur is uncertain. Accordingly, it is reasonably possible that
    our total exposure to asbestos claims may be greater than the
    liability recorded by us in our consolidated financial
    statements and that future charges to income may be necessary.
    The potential future charges could be material in particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded. In
    addition, Metropolitan Life and MetLife, Inc. have been named as
    defendants in several lawsuits brought in connection with
    Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in 2000.

We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as
    information requests, subpoenas and books and record
    examinations, from state and federal regulators and other
    authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant
    regulatory action against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the
    litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer
    significant reputational harm, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, including our ability to attract new customers,
    retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees.
    Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the
    price of stocks of companies in our industry.

The insurance industry has become the focus of increased
    scrutiny by regulatory and law enforcement authorities. This
    scrutiny includes the commencement of investigations and other
    proceedings by the New York State Attorney General and other
    governmental authorities relating to allegations of improper
    conduct in connection with the payment of, and disclosure with
    respect to, contingent commissions paid by insurance companies
    to intermediaries, the solicitation and provision of fictitious
    or inflated quotes, and the use of inducements in the sale of
    insurance products.

One possible result of these investigations and attendant
    lawsuits is that many insurance industry practices and customs
    may change, including, but not limited to, the manner in which
    insurance is marketed and distributed through independent
    brokers and agents. Our business strategy contemplates that we
    will rely heavily on both intermediaries and our internal sales
    force to market and distribute insurance products. We cannot
    predict how industry regulation with respect to the use of
    intermediaries may change. Such changes, however, could
    adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy,
    which could materially affect our growth and profitability.

Recent industry-wide inquiries also include those regarding
    market timing and late trading in mutual funds and variable
    insurance products and, generally, the marketing of products.
    The SEC has commenced an investigation with respect to market
    timing and late trading in a limited number of privately-placed
    variable insurance contracts that were sold through MetLife,
    Inc.’s subsidiary, General American. As previously
    reported, in May 2004, General American received a Wells Notice
    stating that the SEC staff is considering recommending that the
    SEC bring a civil action alleging violations of the
    U.S. securities laws against General American. Under SEC
    procedures, General American can avail itself of the opportunity
    to respond to the SEC staff before it makes a formal
    recommendation regarding whether any action alleging violations
    of the U.S. securities laws should be considered. General
    American has responded to the Wells Notice. We are fully
    cooperating with regard to this investigation.

We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation,
    unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and
    other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated
    claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion,
    investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future,
    and we could become subject to further investigations and have
    lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In
    addition, increased regulatory



scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could
    result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide
    regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board or Other Standard-Setting Bodies May Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP,
    which is periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to
    adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized
    authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards
    we are required to adopt could change the current accounting
    treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements
    and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on
    our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes
    in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations
    May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability

Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to
    insurance products that are also “securities,”
    including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
    policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries
    and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance
    contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under
    these securities laws. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each
    registered separate account is generally divided into

sub-accounts,

each of which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is
    itself a registered investment company under the Investment
    Company Act of 1940. In addition, the variable annuity contracts
    and variable life insurance policies issued by the separate
    accounts are registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of
    1933. Other subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as
    broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
    are members of, and subject to, regulation by NASD. Further,
    some of the Holding Company’s subsidiaries are registered
    as investment advisers with the SEC under the Investment
    Advisers Act of 1940, and are also registered as investment
    advisers in various states, as applicable.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to
    protect investors in the securities markets, as well as protect
    investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and
    regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking
    and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict
    the conduct of business for failure to comply with the
    securities laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or
    regulations that restrict the conduct of our business could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. In particular, changes in the regulations
    governing the registration and distribution of variable
    insurance products, such as changes in the regulatory standards
    under which the sale of a variable annuity contract or variable
    life insurance policy is considered suitable for a particular
    customer, could have such a material adverse effect.

Changes
    in Tax Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to
    Consumers

Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less
    attractive to consumers. For example, reductions in the federal
    income tax that investors are required to pay on long-term
    capital gains and dividends paid on stock may provide an
    incentive for some of our customers and potential customers to
    shift assets away from some insurance company products,
    including life insurance and annuities, designed to defer taxes
    payable on investment returns. Because the income taxes payable
    on long-term capital gains and some dividends paid on stock has
    been reduced, investors may decide that the tax-deferral
    benefits of annuity contracts are less advantageous than the
    potential after-tax income benefits of mutual funds or other
    investment products that provide dividends and long-term capital
    gains. A shift away from life insurance and annuity contracts
    and other tax-deferred products would reduce our income from
    sales of these products, as well as the assets upon which we
    earn investment income.

We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting
    insurance products will be enacted, what the specific terms of
    any such legislation will be or whether, if at all, any
    legislation would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.



State
    Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
    and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay, Deter or Prevent
    Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might
    Consider in Their Best Interests

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
    delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders
    might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may
    prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium
    over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence
    of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
    takeover attempts in the future.

Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would
    face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or
    prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc.
    might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance
    laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife,
    Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or
    impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws
    prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance
    company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance
    regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is
    presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns,
    directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that
    insurance company or its parent company. Federal banking
    authorities would also have to approve the indirect change of
    control of our banking operations. In addition, the Investment
    Company Act of 1940 would require approval by the contract
    owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change
    of control of any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund
    underlying our variable contracts. Finally, NASD approval would
    be necessary for a change of control of any NASD registered
    broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested
    stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,
    including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional
    shares, for a period of three years following the time that the
    stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An
    “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons
    owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding
    voting stock of a corporation.

MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws
    also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a
    takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best
    interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include:
    classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into
    three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings
    by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of
    candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals
    to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority
    voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of
    the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

The stockholder rights plan adopted by MetLife, Inc.’s
    Board of Directors may also have anti-takeover effects. The
    stockholder rights plan is designed to protect MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to
    acquire us and other coercive takeover tactics which, in the
    opinion of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors, could impair
    its ability to represent stockholder interests. The provisions
    of the stockholder rights plan may render an unsolicited
    takeover more difficult or less likely to occur or might prevent
    such a takeover, even though such takeover may offer MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at
    a price above the prevailing market price and may be favored by
    a majority of MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders.

As a
    Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its
    Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds to It to Meet Its Obligations and
    Pay Dividends

MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and
    financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant
    operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and
    permitted payments to it under its tax sharing arrangements with
    its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its
    obligations and to pay preferred and common dividends. If the
    cash the Holding Company receives from its subsidiaries is
    insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding
    company obligations, the Holding Company may be required to
    raise cash through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of
    additional equity or the sale of assets.



The payment of dividends and other distributions to the Holding
    Company by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance
    laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of
    prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In
    addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of
    dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to the
    Holding Company if they determine that the payment could be
    adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation,” “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company” and Note 17
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or
    advances by our foreign subsidiaries to the Holding Company
    could be subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends
    or repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary
    transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations
    in the jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate.
    See “— Our International Operations Face
    Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risk That Could
    Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.”

MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors May Control the Outcome of
    Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions
    of the MetLife Policyholder Trust

Under Metropolitan Life’s plan of reorganization, we
    established the MetLife Policyholder Trust (the
    “Trust”) to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc. common
    stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving cash or
    policy credits under the plan. As of February 26, 2007,
    274,293,334 shares, or 36.3%, of the outstanding shares of
    MetLife, Inc. common stock, are held in the Trust. Because of
    the number of shares held in the Trust and the voting provisions
    of the Trust, the Trust may affect the outcome of matters
    brought to a stockholder vote.

Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions
    described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of
    common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the
    recommendations given by MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to its stockholders or, if the board gives no such
    recommendations, as directed by the board. As a result of the
    voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may be
    able to control votes on matters submitted to a vote of
    stockholders, excluding those fundamental corporate actions, so
    long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common
    stock.

If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified
    in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the
    Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in
    proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions
    include:

•

an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has
    properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a
    nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    or a vote on a stockholder’s proposal to oppose a board
    nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a
    vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders,
    subject to certain conditions;

•

a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
    substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or
    dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of
    stockholders under applicable Delaware law;

•

any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion
    of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities
    or other property; and

•

any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to amend or redeem the rights under the stockholder rights plan,
    other than a proposal with respect to which we have received
    advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that
    the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action
    under Delaware law.

If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions,
    the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by
    the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which
    will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually
    given by trust beneficiaries.



We May
    Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets
    Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed
    Block Policies

The plan of reorganization entered into in connection with
    Metropolitan Life’s 2000 demutualization required that we
    establish and operate an accounting mechanism, known as a closed
    block, to ensure that the reasonable dividend expectations of
    policyholders who own certain individual insurance policies of
    Metropolitan Life are met. See Note 9 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. We allocated assets to the
    closed block in an amount that will produce cash flows which,
    together with anticipated revenue from the policies included in
    the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to
    support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies,
    including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of
    claims and certain expenses and tax, and to provide for the
    continuation of the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999, if the experience underlying such scales continues, and
    for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. We cannot provide assurance that the closed block
    assets, the cash flows generated by the closed block assets and
    the anticipated revenue from the policies included in the closed
    block will be sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed
    under these policies. If they are not sufficient, we must fund
    the shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for
    competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments
    with our general account funds.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of those
    policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are
    greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block
    was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies
    included in the closed block may be greater than they would be
    in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be
    available for distribution over time only to closed block
    policyholders.

The
    Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May
    Adversely Affect the Level of Claim Losses We Incur and the
    Value of Our Investment Portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States
    and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened
    security measures in response to these types of threats may
    cause significant volatility in global financial markets and
    result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions
    to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in
    our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines
    in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by
    the continued threat of terrorism. We cannot predict whether,
    and the extent to which, companies in which we maintain
    investments may suffer losses as a result of financial,
    commercial or economic disruptions, or how any such disruptions
    might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or
    principal on their securities. The continued threat of terrorism
    also could result in increased reinsurance prices and reduced
    insurance coverage and potentially cause us to retain more risk
    than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain
    reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist actions also could
    disrupt our operations centers in the United States or abroad.
    In addition, the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in
    higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated.

The
    Occurrence of Events Unanticipated In Our Disaster Recovery
    Systems and Management Continuity Planning Could Impair Our
    Ability to Conduct Business Effectively

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
    epidemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus,
    a terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our
    disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to conduct business and on our results of
    operations and financial position, particularly if those
    problems affect our computer-based data processing,
    transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable
    data. We depend heavily upon computer systems to provide
    reliable service. Despite our implementation of a variety of
    security measures, our servers could be subject to physical and
    electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized
    tampering with our computer systems. In addition, in the event
    that a significant number of our managers were unavailable in
    the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct
    business could be severely compromised. These interruptions also
    may interfere with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods
    and services and our employees ability to perform their job
    responsibilities.



We
    Face Unforeseen Liabilities Arising from Possible Acquisitions
    and Dispositions of Businesses

We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses
    in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    There could be unforeseen liabilities that arise in connection
    with the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we
    may acquire in the future. In addition, there may be liabilities
    that we fail, or we are unable, to discover in the course of
    performing due diligence investigations on each business that we
    have acquired or may acquire.

Unresolved
    Staff Comments

MetLife, Inc. has no unresolved comments from the SEC
    staff regarding its periodic or current reports under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Item 2.

Properties

In December 2006, we signed a lease for approximately
    410,000 rentable square feet in Manhattan, New York to be
    located on 12 floors. The term of the lease will commence after
    January 1, 2008 and will continue for approximately
    21 years. We anticipate moving certain operations from Long
    Island City to Manhattan in late 2008, but we intend to continue
    to maintain an on-going presence in Long Island City after that
    date.

On November 17, 2006, we sold our Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New York to a
    group led by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty, the real
    estate arm of BlackRock, Inc., for $5.4 billion. The gain
    of approximately $3.0 billion is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income.

In 2005, we sold our 200 Park Avenue property in Manhattan, New
    York for $1.7 billion. The gain is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income. In connection with the sale of the 200
    Park Avenue property, we have retained rights to existing
    signage and are leasing space for associates in the property for
    20 years with optional renewal periods through 2205.
    Associates located in the 200 Park Avenue office, our
    headquarters, include those working in the Institutional and
    Individual segments.

In 2002, we leased approximately 685,000 rentable square
    feet in Long Island City, New York under a long-term lease
    arrangement and approximately 1,600 associates are located
    there. Associates located in Long Island City include those
    working in the Institutional, Individual and International
    segments, as well as Corporate & Other.

We continue to own 16 other buildings in the United States that
    we use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain
    approximately 3.8 million rentable square feet and are
    located in the following states: Florida, Illinois, Missouri,
    New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island
    and Texas. Our computer center in Rensselaer, New York is not
    owned in fee but rather is occupied pursuant to a long-term
    ground lease. We lease space in approximately 600 other
    locations throughout the United States, and these leased
    facilities consist of approximately 7.8 million rentable
    square feet. Approximately 58% of these leases are occupied as
    sales offices for the Individual segment, and we use the balance
    for our other business activities. We also own five buildings
    outside the United States, comprising more than
    300,000 rentable square feet. We lease approximately
    2.0 million rentable square feet in various locations
    outside the United States. Management believes that these
    properties are suitable and adequate for our current and
    anticipated business operations.

We arrange for property and casualty coverage on our properties,
    taking into consideration our risk exposures and the cost and
    availability of commercial coverages, including deductible loss
    levels. In connection with its renewal of those coverages, we
    have arranged $935 million of annual terrorist coverage on
    our real estate portfolio through March 15, 2007, its
    annual renewal date.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought



is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In
    addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary
    damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts
    in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in
    pleadings, together with the actual experience of the Company in
    litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over
    an extended period of time, demonstrate to management that the
    monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim
    bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. Thus,
    unless stated below, the specific monetary relief sought is not
    noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and yearly basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to liabilities for litigation and
    contingencies to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. The review includes senior legal and
    financial personnel. Unless stated below, estimates of possible
    additional losses or ranges of loss for particular matters
    cannot in the ordinary course be made with a reasonable degree
    of certainty. Liabilities are established when it is probable
    that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a
    number of the matters noted below. It is possible that some of
    the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make
    other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could
    not be estimated as of December 31, 2006.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of Metropolitan Life’s plan of reorganization, as amended
    (the “Plan”) and the adequacy and accuracy of
    Metropolitan Life’s disclosure to policyholders regarding
    the Plan. These actions discussed below named as defendants some
    or all of Metropolitan Life, the Holding Company, the individual
    directors, the Superintendent and the underwriters for MetLife,
    Inc.’s initial public offering, Goldman Sachs &
    Company and Credit Suisse First Boston. Metropolitan Life, the
    Holding Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
    et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17,
    2000).

Another putative class action filed in New
    York State court in Kings County has been consolidated with this
    action. The plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class
    actions seek compensatory relief and punitive damages. In 2003,
    the trial court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss
    these two putative class actions. In 2004, the appellate court
    modified the trial court’s order by reinstating certain
    claims against Metropolitan Life, the Holding Company and the
    individual directors. Plaintiffs in these actions have filed a
    consolidated amended complaint. On January 30, 2007, the
    trial court signed an order certifying a litigation class for
    plaintiffs’ claim that defendants violated
    section 7312 of the New York Insurance Law, but denying
    plaintiffs’ motion to certify a litigation class with
    respect to a common law fraud claim. The January 30, 2007
    order implemented the trial court’s May 2, 2006
    memorandum deciding plaintiffs’ class certification motion.
    Defendants have filed a notice of appeal from this decision.

Meloy, et al. v. Superintendent of Ins.,
    et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed April 14,
    2000).

Five persons brought a proceeding under
    Article 78 of New York’s Civil Practice Law and Rules
    challenging the Opinion and Decision of the Superintendent who
    approved the Plan. In this proceeding, petitioners sought to
    vacate the Superintendent’s Opinion and Decision and enjoin
    him from granting final approval of the Plan. On
    November 10, 2005, the trial court granted
    respondents’ motions to dismiss this proceeding.
    Petitioners have filed a notice of appeal.

In re MetLife Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed
    April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against Metropolitan Life and the Holding Company, plaintiffs
    served a second consolidated amended complaint in 2004.
    Plaintiffs assert violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the Plan,
    claiming that the Policyholder Information Booklets failed to
    disclose certain material facts and contained certain material
    misstatements. They seek rescission and compensatory damages. On
    June 22, 2004, the court denied the



defendants’ motion to dismiss the claim of violation of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The court had previously denied
    defendants’ motion to dismiss the claim for violation of
    the Securities Act of 1933. In 2004, the court reaffirmed its
    earlier decision denying defendants’ motion for summary
    judgment as premature. On July 19, 2005, this federal trial
    court certified this lawsuit as a class action against
    Metropolitan Life and the Holding Company.

Fotia, et al. v. MetLife, Inc., et al. (Ont.
    Super. Ct., filed April 3, 2001).

This
    lawsuit was filed in Ontario, Canada on behalf of a proposed
    class of certain former Canadian policyholders against the
    Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, and Metropolitan Life
    Insurance Company of Canada. Plaintiffs’ allegations
    concern the way that their policies were treated in connection
    with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life; they seek
    damages, declarations, and other non-pecuniary relief.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

Metropolitan Life is and has been a defendant in a large number
    of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. Metropolitan Life has
    never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products
    nor has Metropolitan Life issued liability or workers’
    compensation insurance to companies in the business of
    manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or
    asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have
    focused on allegations with respect to certain research,
    publication and other activities of one or more of Metropolitan
    Life’s employees during the period from the 1920’s
    through approximately the 1950’s and allege that
    Metropolitan Life learned or should have learned of certain
    health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things,
    improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks.
    Metropolitan Life believes that it should not have legal
    liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos
    litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by
    numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in
    various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury, and
    factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims
    asserted against Metropolitan Life. Metropolitan Life employs a
    number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss
    exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by
    judicial rulings and settling litigation under appropriate
    circumstances.

Claims asserted against Metropolitan Life have included
    negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the
    health risks associated with asbestos. Metropolitan Life’s
    defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include
    that: (i) Metropolitan Life owed no duty to the plaintiffs
    — it had no special relationship with the plaintiffs
    and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell the
    asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs;
    (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of Metropolitan
    Life; (iii) Metropolitan Life’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) that
    plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos
    were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to
    filing suit has expired. Since 2002, trial courts in California,
    Utah, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Ohio have granted motions
    dismissing claims against Metropolitan Life. Some courts have
    denied Metropolitan Life’s motions to dismiss. There can be
    no assurance that Metropolitan Life will receive favorable
    decisions on motions in the future. While most cases brought to
    date have settled, Metropolitan Life intends to continue to
    defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos exposure.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against Metropolitan Life as of the dates indicated, the
    approximate number of new claims during the years ended on those
    dates and the approximate total settlement payments made to
    resolve asbestos personal injury claims during those years are
    set forth in the following table:

Settlement payments represent payments made by Metropolitan Life
    during the year in connection with settlements made in that year
    and in prior years. Amounts do not include Metropolitan
    Life’s attorneys’ fees and expenses and do not reflect
    amounts received from insurance carriers.

In 2003, Metropolitan Life received approximately 58,750 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 111,700
    claims, and paid approximately $84.2 million for
    settlements reached in 2003 and prior years. The number of
    asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate amount of
    any liability that Metropolitan Life may ultimately incur is
    uncertain.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    Metropolitan Life’s recorded asbestos liability is based on
    Metropolitan Life’s estimation of the following elements,
    as informed by the facts presently known to it, its
    understanding of current law, and its past experiences:
    (i) the reasonably probable and estimable liability for
    asbestos claims already asserted against Metropolitan Life
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    reasonably probable and estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against Metropolitan Life, but which
    Metropolitan Life believes are reasonably probable of assertion;
    and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the
    foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying
    Metropolitan Life’s analysis of the adequacy of its
    liability with respect to asbestos litigation include:
    (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to
    resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.

Metropolitan Life regularly re-evaluates its exposure from
    asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience,
    reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims
    experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends
    impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables
    that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or
    per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other
    companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and
    judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving
    serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and
    other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which claims are
    pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 Metropolitan Life
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Metropolitan Life regularly reevaluates its
    exposure from asbestos litigation and has updated its liability
    analysis for asbestos-related claims through December 31,
    2006.

The ability of Metropolitan Life to estimate its ultimate
    asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty and the
    conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to
    change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is
    difficult to predict with any certainty the numerous variables
    that can affect liability estimates, including the number of
    future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and
    severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of
    the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against Metropolitan Life when exposure to asbestos took place
    after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the
    impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be reasonably
    probable and estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

During 1998, Metropolitan Life paid $878 million in
    premiums for excess insurance policies for asbestos-related
    claims. The excess insurance policies for asbestos-related
    claims provide for recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion,
    which is in excess of a $400 million self-insured
    retention. The asbestos-related policies are also subject to
    annual and per-claim sublimits. Amounts are recoverable under
    the policies annually with respect to claims paid during the
    prior calendar year. Although amounts paid by Metropolitan Life
    in any given year that may be recoverable in the next calendar
    year under the policies will be reflected as a reduction in the
    Company’s



operating cash flows for the year in which they are paid,
    management believes that the payments will not have a material
    adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

Each asbestos-related policy contains an experience fund and a
    reference fund that provides for payments to Metropolitan Life
    at the commutation date if the reference fund is greater than
    zero at commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in
    the loss reimbursements to Metropolitan Life if the cumulative
    return on the reference fund is less than the return specified
    in the experience fund. The return in the reference fund is tied
    to performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. A claim with
    respect to the prior year was made under the excess insurance
    policies in each of 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 for the amounts
    paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of the
    retention. As the performance of the indices impacts the return
    in the reference fund, it is possible that loss reimbursements
    to the Company and the recoverable amount with respect to later
    periods may be less than the amount of the recorded losses.
    Foregone loss reimbursements may be recovered upon commutation
    depending upon future performance of the reference fund. If at
    some point in the future, the Company believes the liability for
    probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related
    claims should be increased, an expense would be recorded and the
    insurance recoverable would be adjusted subject to the terms,
    conditions and limits of the excess insurance policies. Portions
    of the change in the insurance recoverable would be recorded as
    a deferred gain and amortized into income over the estimated
    remaining settlement period of the insurance policies. The
    foregone loss reimbursements were approximately
    $8.3 million with respect to 2002 claims,
    $15.5 million with respect to 2003 claims,
    $15.1 million with respect to 2004 claims,
    $12.7 million with respect to 2005 claims, and estimated to
    be approximately $5.0 million with respect to 2006 claims
    and are estimated, as of December 31, 2006, to be
    approximately $72.2 million in the aggregate, including
    future years.

Sales
    Practices Claims

Over the past several years, Metropolitan Life, New England
    Mutual Life Insurance Company (“New England Mutual”),
    New England Life Insurance Company and General American Life
    Insurance Company (“General American”), have faced
    numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging
    improper marketing and sales of individual life insurance
    policies or annuities. In addition, claims have been brought
    relating to the sale of mutual funds and other products.

As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 280 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against Metropolitan Life;
    approximately 41 sales practices litigation matters pending
    against New England Mutual, New England Life Insurance Company
    and New England Securities Corporation (collectively, “New
    England”); approximately 37 sales practices litigation
    matters pending against General American; and approximately 20
    sales practices litigation matters pending against Walnut Street
    Securities, Inc. (“Walnut Street”). In addition,
    similar litigation matters are pending against MetLife
    Securities, Inc. (“MSI”). Metropolitan Life, New
    England, General American, MSI and Walnut Street continue to
    vigorously defend against the claims in these matters. Some
    sales practices claims have been resolved through settlement,
    others have been won by dispositive motions or have gone to
    trial. Most of the current cases seek substantial damages,
    including in some cases punitive and treble damages and
    attorneys’ fees. Additional litigation relating to the
    Company’s marketing and sales of individual life insurance,
    mutual funds and other products may be commenced in the future.

Two putative class action lawsuits involving sales practices
    claims were filed against Metropolitan Life in Canada. In

Jacynthe Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
    (Que. Super. Ct., filed March 1998)

, plaintiff alleges
    misrepresentations regarding dividends and future payments for
    life insurance policies and seeks unspecified damages. In

Ace
    Quan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Ont. Gen. Div., filed
    April 1997)

, plaintiff alleges breach of contract and
    negligent misrepresentations relating to, among other things,
    life insurance premium payments and seeks damages, including
    punitive damages. By agreement of the parties, Metropolitan Life
    has not yet filed a response in this action.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to Metropolitan
    Life’s, New England’s, General American’s,
    MSI’s or Walnut Street’s sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities or other products. Over the past
    several years, these and a number of investigations by other
    regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and
    certain other relief. The Company may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner. The Company believes
    adequate provision has been made in its consolidated



financial statements for all probable and reasonably estimable
    losses for sales practices claims against Metropolitan Life, New
    England, General American, MSI and Walnut Street.

Property
    and Casualty Actions

Katrina-Related Litigation.

There are a number
    of lawsuits, including a few putative class actions, pending in
    Louisiana and Mississippi against Metropolitan Property and
    Casualty Insurance Company (“MPC”) relating to
    Hurricane Katrina. The lawsuits include claims by policyholders
    for coverage for damages stemming from Hurricane Katrina,
    including for damages resulting from flooding or storm surge. It
    is reasonably possible that other actions will be filed. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the claims in these
    matters.

Stern v. Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. (S.D. Fla.,
    filed October 18, 1999).

A putative class
    action, seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief has
    been filed against MPC’s subsidiary, Metropolitan Casualty
    Insurance Company, in Florida alleging breach of contract and
    unfair trade practices with respect to allowing the use of parts
    not made by the original manufacturer to repair damaged
    automobiles. Discovery is ongoing and a motion for class
    certification is pending. The Company is vigorously defending
    against the claims in this matter.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against MPC in Illinois. One suit claims breach of
    contract and fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical
    claims arising from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee
    pricing system. A motion for class certification has been filed
    and briefed. The second suit originally alleged breach of
    contract and fraud arising from the alleged use of preferred
    provider organizations to reduce medical provider fees covered
    by the medical claims portion of the insurance policy. The court
    granted MPC’s motion to dismiss the fraud claim in the
    second suit. A motion for class certification has been filed and
    briefed. The Company is vigorously defending against the claims
    in these matters.

Regulatory
    Matters and Related Litigation

Regulatory bodies have contacted the Company and have requested
    information relating to market timing and late trading of mutual
    funds and variable insurance products and, generally, the
    marketing of products. The Company believes that many of these
    inquiries are similar to those made to many financial services
    companies as part of industry-wide investigations by various
    regulatory agencies. The SEC has commenced an investigation with
    respect to market timing and late trading in a limited number of
    privately-placed variable insurance contracts that were sold
    through General American. As previously reported, in May 2004,
    General American received a Wells Notice stating that the SEC
    staff is considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil
    action alleging violations of the U.S. securities laws
    against General American. Under the SEC procedures, General
    American can avail itself of the opportunity to respond to the
    SEC staff before it makes a formal recommendation regarding
    whether any action alleging violations of the
    U.S. securities laws should be considered. General American
    has responded to the Wells Notice. The Company is fully
    cooperating with regard to these information requests and
    investigations. The Company at the present time is not aware of
    any systemic problems with respect to such matters that may have
    a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial position.

In December 2006, Metropolitan Life resolved a previously
    disclosed investigation by the Office of the Attorney General of
    the State of New York related to payments to intermediaries in
    the marketing and sale of group life and disability, group LTC
    and group AD&D insurance and related matters. In the
    settlement, Metropolitan Life did not admit liability as to any
    issue of fact or law. Among other things, Metropolitan Life has
    agreed to certain business reforms relating to compensation of
    producers of group insurance, compensation disclosures to group
    insurance clients and the adoption of related standards of
    conduct, some of which it had implemented following the
    commencement of the investigation. Metropolitan Life has paid a
    fine and has made a payment to a restitution fund. It is the
    opinion of management that Metropolitan Life’s resolution
    of this matter will not adversely affect its business. The
    Company has received subpoenas

and/or

other
    discovery requests from regulators, state attorneys general or
    other governmental authorities in other states, including
    Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Florida, and Ohio,
    seeking, among other things, information and documents regarding
    contingent commission payments to brokers, the Company’s
    awareness of any “sham” bids for business, bids and
    quotes that the Company submitted to potential customers,
    incentive agreements entered into with brokers, or compensation
    paid to intermediaries. The



Company also has received a subpoena from the Office of the
    U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California
    asking for documents regarding the insurance broker Universal
    Life Resources. The Company continues to cooperate fully with
    these inquiries and is responding to the subpoenas and other
    discovery requests.

Approximately sixteen broker-related lawsuits in which the
    Company was named as a defendant were filed. Voluntary
    dismissals and consolidations have reduced the number of pending
    actions to two:

The People of the State of California, by and through John
    Garamendi, Ins. Commissioner of the State of California v.
    MetLife, Inc., et al. (Cal. Super. Ct., County of
    San Diego, filed November 18,
    2004).

The California Insurance Commissioner
    filed suit against Metropolitan Life and other non-affiliated
    companies alleging that the defendants violated certain
    provisions of the California Insurance Code. This action seeks
    injunctive relief relating to compensation disclosures.

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district
    proceeding, plaintiffs have filed an amended class action
    complaint consolidating the claims from separate actions that
    had been filed in or transferred to the District of New Jersey
    in 2004 and 2005. The consolidated amended complaint alleges
    that the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, several
    non-affiliated insurance companies and several insurance brokers
    violated RICO, ERISA, and antitrust laws and committed other
    misconduct in the context of providing insurance to employee
    benefit plans and to persons who participate in such employee
    benefit plans. Plaintiffs seek to represent classes of employers
    that established employee benefit plans and persons who
    participated in such employee benefit plans. A motion for class
    certification has been filed. A motion to dismiss has not been
    fully decided. Plaintiffs in several other actions have
    voluntarily dismissed their claims. The Company is vigorously
    defending against the claims in these matters.

Following an inquiry commencing in March 2004, the staff of NASD
    notified MSI that it made a preliminary determination to
    recommend charging MSI with the failure to adopt, maintain and
    enforce written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to
    achieve compliance with suitability requirements regarding the
    sale of college savings plans, also known as 529 plans. This
    notification followed an industry-wide inquiry by NASD examining
    sales of 529 plans. In November 2006, MSI and NASD reached a
    settlement resolving the matter, which includes payment of a
    penalty and customer remediation. MSI neither admitted nor
    denied NASD’s findings.

In February 2006, the Company learned that the SEC commenced a
    formal investigation of New England Securities (“NES”)
    in connection with the suitability of its sales of variable
    universal life insurance policies. The Company believes that
    others in the insurance industry are the subject of similar
    investigations by the SEC. NES is cooperating fully with the SEC.

In 2005, MSI received a notice from the Illinois Department of
    Securities asserting possible violations of the Illinois
    Securities Act in connection with sales of a former
    affiliate’s mutual funds. A response has been submitted and
    MSI intends to cooperate fully with the Illinois Department of
    Securities.

A former registered representative of Tower Square Securities,
    Inc. (“Tower Square”), a broker-dealer subsidiary of
    MICC, is alleged to have defrauded individuals by diverting
    funds for his personal use. In June 2005, the SEC issued a
    formal order of investigation with respect to Tower Square and
    served Tower Square with a subpoena. The Securities and Business
    Investments Division of the Connecticut Department of Banking
    and NASD are also reviewing this matter. On April 18, 2006,
    the Connecticut Department of Banking issued a notice to Tower
    Square asking it to demonstrate its prior compliance with
    applicable Connecticut securities laws and regulations. In the
    context of the above, a number of NASD arbitration matters and
    litigation matters were commenced in 2005 and 2006 against Tower
    Square. It is reasonably possible that other actions will be
    brought regarding this matter. Tower Square intends to fully
    cooperate with the SEC, NASD and the Connecticut Department of
    Banking, as appropriate, with respect to the matters described
    above.

Other
    Litigation

Roberts, et al. v. Tishman Speyer Properties,
    et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed January 22,
    2007).

This lawsuit was filed by a putative class
    of “market rate” tenants at Stuyvesant Town and Peter
    Cooper Village against parties including Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company and Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity
    Company. Metropolitan Life was initially a named defendant but
    the action has been discontinued as to Metropolitan Life



since it did not own the properties during the time period in
    question. This group of tenants claims that the MetLife
    entities, and since the sale of the properties, Tishman Speyer
    as current owner, improperly charged market rents when only
    lower regulated rents were permitted. The allegations are based
    on the impact of so-called J-51 tax abatements. The lawsuit
    seeks declaratory relief and damages.

Carroll v. Tishman
    Speyer Properties, et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed
    February 14, 2007).

A second putative class
    action was filed against the same defendants alleging similar
    claims as in the Roberts lawsuit, and in addition includes a
    claim of unjust enrichment and purported violation of New York
    General Business Law Section 349. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend against the claims in both actions.

Brubaker, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
    et al. (D.C. Cir., filed October 20,
    2000).

Plaintiffs, in this putative class action
    lawsuit, allege that they were denied certain ad hoc pension
    increases awarded to retirees under the Metropolitan Life
    retirement plan. The ad hoc pension increases were awarded only
    to retirees (i.e., individuals who were entitled to an immediate
    retirement benefit upon their termination of employment) and not
    available to individuals like these plaintiffs whose employment,
    or whose spouses’ employment, had terminated before they
    became eligible for an immediate retirement benefit. The
    plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of former
    Metropolitan Life employees, or their surviving spouses, who are
    receiving deferred vested annuity payments under the retirement
    plan and who were allegedly eligible to receive the ad hoc
    pension increases. In September 2005, Metropolitan Life’s
    motion for summary judgment was granted. Plaintiffs’ motion
    for reconsideration was denied. Plaintiffs appealed to the
    United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit. The parties are currently briefing the appeal and oral
    argument is set for March 15, 2007.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife
    Inc., et al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19,
    2003).

The American Dental Association and three
    individual providers have sued the Holding Company, Metropolitan
    Life and other non-affiliated insurance companies in a putative
    class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs purport to represent a
    nationwide class of

in-network

providers who allege that their claims are being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. The
    district court has granted in part and denied in part the
    Company’s motion to dismiss. The Company has filed another
    motion to dismiss. The court has issued a tag-along order,
    related to a medical managed care trial, which stays the lawsuit
    indefinitely.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
    et al. (W.D. Okla., filed January 31,
    2007).

A putative class action complaint was
    filed against Metropolitan Life, MetLife Securities, Inc. and
    MetLife Investment Advisors Company, LLC. Plaintiff asserts
    legal theories of violations of the federal securities laws and
    violations of state laws with respect to the sale of certain
    proprietary products (as opposed to non-proprietary products) by
    the Company’s agency distribution group. Plaintiff seeks
    rescission, compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend against the claims in this matter.

Macomber, et al. v. Travelers Property Casualty
    Corp., et al. (Conn. Super. Ct., Hartford, filed
    April 7, 1999).

An amended putative class
    action complaint was filed against The Travelers Life and
    Annuity Company (now known as MetLife Life and Annuity Company
    of Connecticut (“MLAC”)), Travelers Equity Sales, Inc.
    and certain former affiliates. The amended complaint alleges
    Travelers Property Casualty Corporation, a former MLAC
    affiliate, purchased structured settlement annuities from MLAC
    and spent less on the purchase of those structured settlement
    annuities than agreed with claimants, and that commissions paid
    to brokers for the structured settlement annuities, including an
    affiliate of MLAC, were paid in part to Travelers Property
    Casualty Corporation. On May 26, 2004, the Connecticut
    Superior Court certified a nationwide class action involving the
    following claims against MLAC: violation of the Connecticut
    Unfair Trade Practice Statute, unjust enrichment, and civil
    conspiracy. On June 15, 2004, the defendants appealed the
    class certification order. In March 2006, the Connecticut
    Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s certification of a
    class. Plaintiff may seek to file another motion for class
    certification. Defendants have moved for summary judgment. The
    Company is continuing to vigorously defend against the claims in
    this matter.

Metropolitan Life also has been named as a defendant in a number
    of silicosis, welding and mixed dust cases in various states.
    The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters.



Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed above and those otherwise provided
    for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements,
    have arisen in the course of the Company’s business,
    including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities
    as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor and
    taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and
    other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and
    conduct investigations concerning the Company’s compliance
    with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted above in
    connection with specific matters. In some of the matters
    referred to above, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

For purposes of this discussion, “MetLife” or the
    “Company” refers to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“Metropolitan Life”).
    Following this summary is a discussion addressing the
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition of
    the Company for the periods indicated. This discussion should be
    read in conjunction with the forward-looking statement
    information included below, “Risk Factors,”
    “Selected Financial Data” and the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations contains statements which

Executive
    Summary

MetLife is a leading provider of insurance and other financial
    services with operations throughout the United States and the
    regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Through its
    domestic and international subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife,
    Inc. offers life insurance, annuities, automobile and homeowners
    insurance, retail banking and other financial services to
    individuals, as well as group insurance, reinsurance and
    retirement & savings products and services to
    corporations and other institutions. MetLife is organized into
    five operating segments: Institutional, Individual,
    Auto & Home, International and Reinsurance, as well as
    Corporate & Other.

The management’s discussion and analysis which follows
    isolates, in order to be meaningful, the results of the
    Travelers acquisition in the period over period comparison as
    the Travelers acquisition was not included in the results of the
    Company until July 1, 2005. The Travelers’ amounts
    which have been isolated represent the results of the Travelers
    legal entities which have been acquired. These amounts represent
    the impact of the Travelers acquisition; however, as business
    currently transacted through the acquired Travelers legal
    entities is transitioned to legal entities already owned by the
    Company, some of which has already occurred, the identification
    of the Travelers legal entity business will not necessarily be
    indicative of the impact of the Travelers acquisition on the
    results of the Company.

As a part of the Travelers acquisition, management realigned
    certain products and services within several of the
    Company’s segments to better conform to the way it manages
    and assesses its business. Accordingly, all prior period segment
    results have been adjusted to reflect such product
    reclassifications. Also in connection with the Travelers
    acquisition, management has utilized its economic capital model
    to evaluate the deployment of capital based upon the unique and
    specific nature of the risks inherent in the Company’s
    existing and newly acquired businesses and has adjusted such
    allocations based upon this model.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005

The Company reported $6,159 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of
    $7.99 for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to
    $4,651 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of $6.16 for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. Excluding the acquisition
    of Travelers, which contributed $317 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase, net
    income available to common shareholders increased by
    $1,191 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    compared to the 2005 period.

Income from discontinued operations consisted of net investment
    income and net investment gains related to real estate
    properties that the Company had classified as

available-for-sale

or had sold and, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the operations and gain upon disposal from the sale of
    SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”) on January 31, 2005
    and for the year ended December 31, 2005, the operations of
    P.T. Sejahtera (“MetLife Indonesia”) which was
    sold on September 29, 2005. Income from discontinued
    operations, net of income tax, increased by $1,552 million,
    or 95%, to $3,188 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $1,636 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. This increase is primarily due to a gain
    of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the sale of the Peter
    Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New
    York, as well as a gain of $32 million, net of income tax,
    related to the sale of SSRM during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. This increase was partially offset by
    gains during the year ended December 31, 2005 including
    $1,193 million, net of income tax, on the sales of the One
    Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in Manhattan, New
    York, as well as gains on the sales of SSRM and MetLife
    Indonesia of $177 million and $10 million,
    respectively, both net of income tax. In addition, there was
    lower net investment income and net investment gains from
    discontinued operations related to other real estate properties
    sold or

held-for-sale

during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

Net investment losses increased by $817 million, net of
    income tax, to a loss of $877 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from a loss of $60 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition
    of Travelers, which contributed a loss of $177 million
    during the first six months of 2006 to the year over year
    increase, net investment losses increased by $640 million.
    The increase in net investment losses was due to a combination
    of losses from the

mark-to-market

on derivatives and foreign currency transaction losses during
    2006,



largely driven by increases in U.S. interest rates and the
    weakening of the dollar against the major currencies the Company
    hedges, notably the euro and pound sterling.

Dividends on the Holding Company’s Series A and Series B
    preferred shares (“Preferred Shares”) issued in
    connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers increased
    by $71 million, to $134 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, from $63 million for the comparable
    2005 period, as the preferred stock was issued in June 2005.

The remainder of the increase of $350 million in net income
    available to common shareholders for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the 2005 period was primarily
    due to an increase in premiums, fees and other revenues
    attributable to continued business growth across all of the
    Company’s operating segments. Also contributing to the
    increase was higher net investment income primarily due to an
    overall increase in the asset base, an increase in fixed
    maturity security yields, improved results on real estate and
    real estate joint ventures, mortgage loans, and other limited
    partnership interests, as well as higher short-term interest
    rates on cash equivalents and short-term investments. These
    increases were partially offset by a decline in net investment
    income from securities lending results, and bond and commercial
    mortgage prepayment fees. Favorable underwriting results for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 were partially offset by a
    decrease in net interest margins. These increases were partially
    offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to higher
    interest expense on debt, increased general spending, higher
    compensation and commission costs and higher expenses related to
    growth initiatives and information technology projects,
    partially offset by a reduction in Travelers’ integration
    expenses, principally corporate incentives.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004

The Company reported $4,651 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of
    $6.16 for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
    $2,758 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of $3.65 for
    the year ended December 31, 2004. The acquisition of
    Travelers contributed $233 million to net income available
    to common shareholders for the year ended December 31,
    2005. Excluding the impact of Travelers, net income available to
    common shareholders increased by $1,660 million in the 2005
    period. The years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 include
    the impact of certain transactions or events, the timing, nature
    and amount of which are generally unpredictable. These
    transactions are described in each applicable segment’s
    discussion below. These items contributed a benefit of
    $71 million, net of income tax, to the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and a benefit of $113 million, net
    of income tax, to the comparable 2004 period. Excluding the
    impact of these items, net income available to common
    shareholders increased by $1,702 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 compared to the prior 2004 period.

In 2005, the Company sold its One Madison Avenue and 200 Park
    Avenue properties in Manhattan, New York, which, combined,
    resulted in a gain of $1,193 million, net of income tax. In
    addition, during 2005, the Company completed the sales of SSRM
    and MetLife Indonesia and recognized gains of $177 million
    and $10 million, respectively, both net of income tax. In
    2004, the Company completed the sale of the Sears Tower property
    resulting in a gain of $85 million, net of income tax.
    Accordingly, income from discontinued operations and,
    correspondingly, net income, increased by $1,370 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the 2004
    period primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales.

These increases were partially offset by an increase in net
    investment losses of $170 million, net of income tax, for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the
    corresponding period in 2004. The acquisition of Travelers
    contributed a loss of $132 million, net of income tax, to
    this decrease. Excluding the impact of Travelers, net investment
    gains (losses) decreased by $38 million, net of income tax,
    in the 2005 period. This decrease is primarily due to losses on
    fixed maturity security sales resulting from continued portfolio
    repositioning in the 2005 period. Significantly offsetting these
    reductions is an increase in gains from the

mark-to-market

on derivatives in 2005. The derivative gains resulted from
    changes in the value of the dollar versus major foreign
    currencies, including the euro and pound sterling, and changes
    in U.S. interest rates during the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

The increase in net income available to common shareholders
    during the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the
    prior year is partially due to the decrease in net income
    available to common shareholders in the prior year of
    $86 million, net of income tax, as a result of a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle in



2004 recorded in accordance with Statement of Position
    (“SOP”)

03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
    Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

(“SOP 03-1”).

In addition, during the second half of the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Holding Company paid
    $63 million in dividends on the Preferred Shares issued in
    connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers.

The remaining increase in net income available to common
    shareholders of $347 million is primarily due to an
    increase in premiums, fees and other revenues primarily from
    continued sales growth across most of the Company’s
    business segments, as well as the positive impact of the
    U.S. financial markets on policy fees. Policy fees from
    variable life and annuity and investment-type products are
    typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in
    policyholder accounts. The value of these assets can fluctuate
    depending on equity performance. In addition, continued strong
    investment spreads are largely due to higher than expected net
    investment income from corporate joint venture income and bond
    and commercial mortgage prepayment fees. Partially offsetting
    these increases is a rise in expenses primarily due to higher
    interest expense, integration costs, corporate incentive
    expenses, non deferrable volume-related expenses, corporate
    support expenses and DAC amortization.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

On September 29, 2005, the Company completed the sale of
    MetLife Indonesia to a third party, resulting in a gain upon
    disposal of $10 million, net of income tax. As a result of
    this sale, the Company recognized income (loss) from
    discontinued operations of $5 million and
    ($9) million, net of income tax, for the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company
    reclassified the operations of MetLife Indonesia into
    discontinued operations for all years presented.

On September 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition
    of CitiStreet Associates, a division of CitiStreet LLC, which is
    primarily involved in the distribution of annuity products and
    retirement plans to the education, healthcare, and

not-for-profit

markets, for $56 million, of which $2 million was
    allocated to goodwill and $54 million to other identifiable
    intangibles, specifically the value of customer relationships
    acquired, which has a weighted average amortization period of
    16 years. CitiStreet Associates was integrated with MetLife
    Resources, a focused distribution channel of MetLife, which is
    dedicated to provide retirement plans and financial services to
    the same markets.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”) for $12.1 billion.
    The results of Travelers’ operations were included in the
    Company’s financial statements beginning July 1, 2005.
    As a result of the acquisition, management of the Company
    increased significantly the size and scale of the Company’s
    core insurance and annuity products and expanded the
    Company’s presence in both the retirement &
    savings’ domestic and international markets. The
    distribution agreements executed with Citigroup as part of the
    acquisition provide the Company with one of the broadest
    distribution networks in the industry. The initial consideration
    paid by the Holding Company for the acquisition consisted of
    $10.9 billion in cash and 22,436,617 shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock with a market value of
    $1.0 billion to Citigroup and $100 million in other
    transaction costs. Additional consideration of $115 million
    was paid by the Holding Company to Citigroup in 2006 as a result
    of the finalization by both parties of their review of the
    June 30, 2005 financial statements and final resolution as
    to the interpretation of the provisions of the acquisition
    agreement. In addition to cash on-hand, the purchase price was
    financed through the issuance of common stock, debt securities,
    common equity units and preferred stock. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Holding Company — Liquidity Sources.”

On January 31, 2005, the Company completed the sale of SSRM
    to a third party for $328 million in cash and stock. As a
    result of the sale of SSRM, the Company recognized income from
    discontinued operations of $157 million, net of income tax,
    comprised of a realized gain of $165 million, net of income
    tax, and an operating expense related to a lease abandonment of
    $8 million, net of income tax. Under the terms of the sale
    agreement, MetLife will have an opportunity to receive
    additional payments based on, among other things, certain
    revenue retention and growth measures. The purchase price is
    also subject to reduction over five years, depending on
    retention of certain MetLife-related business. Also under the
    terms of such agreement, MetLife had the opportunity to receive
    additional consideration for the retention of certain customers
    for a specific period in 2005. Upon



finalization of the computation, the Company received payments
    of $30 million, net of income tax, in the second quarter of
    2006 and $12 million, net of income tax, in the fourth
    quarter of 2005 due to the retention of these specific customer
    accounts. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company eliminated
    $4 million of a liability that was previously recorded with
    respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale
    of SSRM, resulting in a benefit to the Company of
    $2 million, net of income tax. The Company believes that
    future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable.
    The Company reported the operations of SSRM in discontinued
    operations. Additionally, the sale of SSRM resulted in the
    elimination of the Company’s Asset Management segment. The
    remaining asset management business, which is insignificant, is
    reported in Corporate & Other. The Company’s
    discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2005 included expenses of $6 million, net of income tax,
    related to the sale of SSRM.

Industry
    Trends

The Company’s segments continue to be influenced by a
    variety of trends that affect the industry.

Financial Environment.

The level of long-term
    interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a
    negative impact on the demand for and the profitability of
    spread-based products such as fixed annuities, guaranteed
    interest contracts (“GICs”) and universal life
    insurance. A flat or inverted yield curve and low long-term
    interest rates will be a concern until new money rates on
    corporate bonds are higher than overall life insurer investment
    portfolio yields. Equity market performance can also impact the
    profitability of life insurers, as product demand and fee
    revenue from variable annuities and fee revenue from pension
    products tied to separate account balances often reflect equity
    market performance.

Steady Economy.

A steady economy provides
    improving demand for group insurance and retirement &
    savings-type products. Group insurance premium growth, with
    respect to life and disability products, for example, is closely
    tied to employers’ total payroll growth. Additionally, the
    potential market for these products is expanded by new business
    creation. Bond portfolio credit losses continue close to low
    historical levels due to the steady economy.

Demographics.

In the coming decade, a key
    driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will
    be the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and needs
    of the retiring Baby Boomers. As a result of increasing
    longevity, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings
    to finance retirements that may span 30 or more years. Helping
    the Baby Boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and
    subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income
    represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry.

Life insurers are well positioned to address the Baby
    Boomers’ rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for
    income protection. The Company believes that, among life
    insurers, those with strong brands, high financial strength
    ratings and broad distribution, are best positioned to
    capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection
    products to Baby Boomers.

Moreover, the life insurance industry’s products and the
    needs they are designed to address are complex. The Company
    believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need
    to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and
    that, in the workplace, as employees take greater responsibility
    for their benefit options and retirement planning, they will
    need information about their possible individual needs. One of
    the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the
    delivery of this information in a cost effective manner.

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base.



Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and
    capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators
    have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several
    markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products.

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. This act is considered to be the
    most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”) on September 2, 1974. The provisions of
    the PPA may have a significant impact on demand for pension,
    retirement savings, and lifestyle protection products in both
    the institutional and retail markets. This legislation, while
    not immediate, may have a positive impact on the life insurance
    and financial services industries in the future.

Impact of
    Hurricanes

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the
    states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, causing
    catastrophic damage to these coastal regions. MetLife’s
    cumulative gross losses from Hurricane Katrina were
    $333 million and $335 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily arising from the
    Company’s homeowners business. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized total
    net losses, net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables and
    including reinstatement premiums and other reinsurance-related
    premium adjustments related to the catastrophe as follows:

On October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall across
    the state of Florida. MetLife’s cumulative gross losses
    from Hurricane Wilma were $64 million and $57 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
    arising from the Company’s homeowners and automobile
    businesses. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company’s Auto & Home segment recognized
    total losses, net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables, of
    $29 million and $32 million, respectively, related to
    Hurricane Wilma.

Additional hurricane-related losses may be recorded in future
    periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to
    reinsurers are processed. Reinsurance recoveries are dependent
    upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers, which may
    be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and otherwise. In addition,
    lawsuits, including purported class actions, have been filed in
    Louisiana and Mississippi challenging denial of claims for
    damages caused to property during Hurricane Katrina.
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company
    (“MPC”) is a named party in some of these lawsuits. In
    addition, rulings in cases in which MPC is not a party may
    affect interpretation of its policies. MPC intends to vigorously
    defend these matters. However, any adverse rulings could result
    in an increase in the Company’s hurricane-related claim
    exposure and losses. Based on information known by management,
    it does not believe that additional claim losses resulting from
    Hurricane Katrina will have a material adverse impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Summary
    of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and



assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements. The most critical estimates include those
    used in determining:

i)

the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market
    values;

ii)

investment impairments;

iii)

the recognition of income on certain investments;

iv)

application of the consolidation rules to certain investments;

v)

the fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

vi)

the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment
    and amortization of VOBA;

vii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

viii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

ix)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

x)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the fair value of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying these policies, management makes
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Investments

The Company’s principal investments are in fixed maturity
    and equity securities, mortgage and consumer loans, policy
    loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships, short-term investments, and other invested assets.
    The Company’s investments are exposed to three primary
    sources of risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The
    financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks,
    are those associated with the determination of fair values, the
    recognition of impairments, the recognition of income on certain
    investments, and the potential consolidation of previously
    unconsolidated subsidiaries.

The Company’s investments in fixed maturity and equity
    securities are classified as

available-for-sale,

except for trading securities, and are reported at their
    estimated fair value. The fair values for public fixed maturity
    securities and public equity securities are based on quoted
    market prices or estimates from independent pricing services.
    However, in cases where quoted market prices are not available,
    such as for private fixed maturities, fair values are estimated
    using present value or valuation techniques. The determination
    of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based
    on: (i) valuation methodologies; (ii) securities the
    Company deems to be comparable; and (iii) assumptions
    deemed appropriate given the circumstances. The fair value
    estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
    available market information and judgments about financial
    instruments, including estimates of the timing and amounts of
    expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer
    or counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value
    include: coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry
    sector of the issuer, and quoted market prices of comparable
    securities. The use of different methodologies and assumptions
    may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

One of the significant estimates related to

available-for-sale

securities is the evaluation of investments for

other-than-temporary

impairments. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred
    is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three



categories of securities: (i) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and
    (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had
    declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater. Additionally, management
    considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and
    uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in
    the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the
    prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in management’s
    evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about
    the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.
    Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation
    process include, but are not limited to:

i)

the length of time and the extent to which the market value has
    been below cost or amortized cost;

ii)

the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties;

iii)

the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

iv)

the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed
    geographic locations;

v)

the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer,
    series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type
    of loss or has exhausted natural resources;

vi)

the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value
    to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost;

vii)

unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset-backed
    securities; and

viii)

other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    impairments in value deemed to be

other-than-temporary

in the period in which the determination is made. These
    impairments are included within net investment gains (losses)
    and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    is reduced accordingly. The Company does not change the revised
    cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on
    other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based
    upon the Company’s periodic evaluation and assessment of
    known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset
    class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as
    conditions change and new information becomes available.
    Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects
    changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such
    evaluations are revised.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain investment transactions,
    trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market conditions,
    which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be
    earned.

Additionally, when the Company enters into certain structured
    investment transactions, real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnerships for which the Company may be deemed to be
    the primary beneficiary under Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51

,
    it may be required to consolidate such investments. The
    accounting rules for the determination of the primary
    beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the
    contractual rights and obligations associated with each party
    involved in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s
    expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation
    of such estimates to each party.

The use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the
    determination of the fair value of investments, the timing and
    amount of impairments, the recognition of income, or
    consolidation of investments may have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.



Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions
    including swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. The
    Company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks. The
    risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in
    fair values related to financial instruments and currency
    exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign
    operations. To a lesser extent, the Company also uses credit
    derivatives to synthetically replicate investment risks and
    returns which are not readily available in the cash market. The
    Company also purchases investment securities, issues certain
    insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts
    that have embedded derivatives.

Fair value of derivatives is determined by quoted market prices
    or through the use of pricing models. The determination of fair
    values, when quoted market values are not available, is based on
    valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under
    the circumstances. Values can be affected by changes in interest
    rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices, credit
    spreads, market volatility and liquidity. Values can also be
    affected by changes in estimates and assumptions used in pricing
    models. Such assumptions include estimates of volatility,
    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, other financial indices
    and credit ratings. Essential to the analysis of the fair value
    is a risk of counterparty default. The use of different
    assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated
    derivative fair value amounts, as well as the amount of reported
    net income. Also, fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives
    which have not been designated for hedge accounting may result
    in significant volatility in net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it is
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported. Measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging
    relationships are also subject to interpretations and
    estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have
    a material effect on the amount reported in net income.

Additionally, there is a risk that embedded derivatives
    requiring bifurcation have not been identified and reported at
    fair value in the consolidated financial statements and that
    their related changes in fair value could materially affect
    reported net income.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. The costs that
    vary with and relate to the production of new business are
    deferred as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions
    and agency and policy issue expenses. VOBA is an intangible
    asset that reflects the estimated fair value of in-force
    contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents
    the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value
    of the right to receive future cash flows from the business
    in-force at the acquisition date. VOBA is based on actuarially
    determined projections, by each block of business, of future
    policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity,
    separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses,
    investment returns and other factors. Actual experience on the
    purchased business may vary from these projections. The recovery
    of DAC and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of
    the related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the
    financial statements for reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement



of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is
    re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those
    previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used, and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses, and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are
    below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting
    period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business
    remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period. Returns that are higher than the Company’s
    long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which
    increases the Company’s future fee expectations and
    decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death
    benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross
    profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than
    the Company’s long-term expectation. The Company’s
    practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from
    returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation
    in equity markets is not changed by short-term market
    fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim
    deviations are expected. The Company monitors these changes and
    only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation
    changes. The effect of an increase/(decrease) by 100 basis
    points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely
    to result in a decrease/(increase) in the DAC and VOBA balances
    of approximately $70 million for this factor.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the



calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may
    have significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Over the past two years, the Company’s most significant
    assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future
    gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA
    have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment
    returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and
    policyholder dividends on contracts included within the
    Individual Business segment. The Company expects these
    assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause
    significant changes in the future. Changes in these assumptions
    can be offsetting and the Company is unable to predict their
    movement or offsetting impact over time.

The following chart illustrates the effect on DAC and VOBA
    within the Company’s Individual segment of changing each of
    the respective assumptions during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005:

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, DAC and VOBA for the

    $20.8 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
    acquired. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least
    annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as
    adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may
    be justification for conducting an interim test.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business that is one level below the
    operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared
    and regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes
    of goodwill impairment testing, goodwill within
    Corporate & Other is allocated to reporting units
    within the Company’s business segments. If the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair
    value, the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as
    a charge against net income. The fair values of the reporting
    units are determined using a market multiple, a discounted cash
    flow model, or a cost approach. The critical estimates necessary
    in determining fair value are projected earnings, comparative
    market multiples and the discount rate.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid, reduced by the present
    value of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are
    established based on methods and underlying assumptions in
    accordance with GAAP and applicable actuarial standards.
    Principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities
    for future policy benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy
    lapse, renewal, retirement, investment returns, inflation,
    expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the
    respective product type. These assumptions are established at
    the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the
    experience for the period the policy benefits are payable.
    Utilizing these assumptions, liabilities are established on a



block of business basis. If experience is less favorable than
    assumptions, additional liabilities may be required, resulting
    in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims.

Liabilities for future policy benefits for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Other policyholder funds include claims that have been
    reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on
    life and non-medical health insurance. Liabilities for unpaid
    claims are estimated based upon the Company’s historical
    experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the
    effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk
    management programs. With respect to property and casualty
    insurance, such unpaid claims are reduced for anticipated
    salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in such
    estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations
    in the period in which the changes occur.

Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income
    benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and
    secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life
    policies are based on estimates of the expected value of
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal
    and variable life secondary guarantees and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent
    with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the
    same variability and risk.

The Company offers certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders. These include guaranteed
    minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) riders and
    guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit
    (“GMAB”) riders. GMWB and GMAB riders are
    embedded derivatives, which are measured at fair value
    separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes
    in fair value reported in net investment gains (losses). The
    fair values of GMWB and GMAB riders are calculated based on
    actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the
    projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract
    charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating
    expectations concerning policyholder behavior. These riders may
    be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity
    markets, causing an increase in the liability for future policy
    benefits, negatively affecting net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the
    Company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing
    jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company
    provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently
    payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. The Company’s accounting for income taxes
    represents management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
    realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of
    sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward
    periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
    Valuation allowances are established when management determines
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that deferred income tax assets will not be realized.
    Significant



judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances
    should be established as well as the amount of such allowances.
    When making such determination, consideration is given to, among
    other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in
    determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets
    significantly change or when receipt of new information
    indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances.
    Additionally, future events such as changes in tax legislation
    could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the
    effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly affect
    the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in
    the year these changes occur.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a
    provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and
    property and casualty insurance products. Accounting for
    reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates,
    particularly related to the future performance of the underlying
    business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks.
    The Company periodically reviews actual and anticipated
    experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to
    establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed
    reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of
    counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria
    similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process
    discussed previously. Additionally, for each of its reinsurance
    contracts, the Company determines if the contract provides
    indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance
    risk, in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The
    Company reviews all contractual features, particularly those
    that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the
    reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely
    reimbursement of claims. If the Company determines that a
    reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a
    reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance
    risk, the Company records the contract using the deposit method
    of accounting.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor pension and other
    postretirement plans covering employees who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. The obligations and expenses
    associated with these plans require an extensive use of
    assumptions such as the discount rate, expected rate of return
    on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases,
    healthcare cost trend rates, as well as assumptions regarding
    participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements,
    withdrawal rates and mortality. Management, in consultation with
    its independent consulting actuarial firm, determines these
    assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical
    performance of the plan and its assets, currently available
    market and industry data and expected benefit payout streams.
    The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results
    due to, among other factors, changing market and economic
    conditions and changes in participant demographics. These
    differences may have a significant effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and liquidity.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a
    loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits,
    including the Company’s asbestos-related liability, are
    especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of
    available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that
    can affect liability estimates. The data and variables that
    impact the assumptions used to estimate the Company’s
    asbestos-related liability include the number of future claims,
    the cost to resolve



claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and
    future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a
    particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the
    jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of
    tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow
    plaintiffs to pursue claims against the Company when exposure to
    asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were
    well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse
    verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual basis the
    Company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities
    for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related
    contingencies to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in
    certain of the Company’s litigation and regulatory
    investigations, including asbestos-related cases, or the use of
    different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded
    could have a material effect upon the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Economic
    Capital

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.
    This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk-based
    capital (“RBC”) formula, which is not as refined in
    its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the
    Company’s businesses.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $27 million,
    or 1%, to $3,105 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $3,078 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. Excluding the acquisition of Travelers,
    which contributed $317 million during the first six months
    of 2006 to the year over year increase, income from continuing
    operations decreased by $290 million. Income from
    continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005 included the impact of certain transactions or events,
    the timing, nature and amount of which are generally
    unpredictable. These transactions are described in each
    applicable segment’s discussion. These items contributed a
    charge of $23 million, net of income tax, to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. These items contributed a benefit of
    $48 million, net of income tax, to the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Excluding the impact of these items and
    the acquisition of Travelers, income from continuing operations
    decreased by $219 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the prior 2005 period.

The Institutional segment’s income from continuing
    operations decreased primarily due to an increase in net
    investment losses, a decline in interest margins, an increase in
    operating expenses, which included a charge associated with
    costs related to the sale of certain small market recordkeeping
    businesses, a charge associated with non-deferrable LTC
    commissions expense and a charge associated with costs related
    to a previously announced regulatory settlement, partially
    offset by the impact of integration costs in the prior year and
    favorable underwriting results.

The Individual segment’s income from continuing operations
    decreased as a result of an increase in net investment losses, a
    decline in interest margins, higher expenses and annuity
    benefits, as well as increases in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances (“PABs”) and
    policyholder dividends. These decreases were partially offset by
    increased fee income related to the growth in separate account
    products, favorable underwriting results in life products, lower
    DAC amortization and a decrease in the closed block-related
    policyholder dividend obligation.

Income from continuing operations in Corporate & Other
    decreased primarily due to higher investment losses, higher
    interest expense on debt, corporate support expenses, interest
    credited to bankholder deposits and legal-related costs,
    partially offset by an increase in tax benefits, an increase in
    net investment income, lower integration costs and an increase
    in other revenues.

The decrease in income from continuing operations in the
    International segment was primarily the result of a decrease in
    Taiwan due to a loss recognition adjustment and a restructuring
    charge, partially offset by reserve refinements associated with
    the implementation of a new valuation system. Income from
    continuing operations decreased in Canada primarily due to the
    realignment of economic capital in the prior year. Income from
    continuing operations in Mexico decreased primarily due to an
    increase in amortization of DAC, higher operating expenses, the
    net impact of an adjustment to the liability for experience
    refunds on a block of business, a decrease in various one-time
    other revenue items in both periods, as well as an increase in
    income tax expense due to a tax benefit realized in the prior
    year. These decreases in Mexico were partially offset by a
    decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused by a
    decrease in unrealized investment gains on invested assets
    supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year, a
    decrease in policyholder benefits associated with a large group
    policy that was not renewed by the policyholder, a benefit in
    the current year from the release of liabilities for pending
    claims that were determined to be invalid following a review,
    and the unfavorable impact in the prior year of contingent
    liabilities. In addition, a decrease in Brazil was primarily due
    to an increase in policyholder benefits and claims related to an
    increase in future policyholder benefit liabilities on specific
    blocks of business and an increase in litigation liabilities, as
    well as adverse claim experience in the current year. The home
    office recorded higher infrastructure expenditures in support of
    segment growth, as well as a contingent tax liability. Results
    of the Company’s investment in Japan decreased primarily
    due to variability in the hedging program. In addition, expenses
    related to the Company’s

start-up

operations in Ireland reduced income from continuing operations.
    A valuation allowance was established against the deferred tax
    benefit resulting from the Ireland losses. Partially offsetting
    these decreases in income from continuing operations were
    increases in Chile and the United Kingdom due to continued
    growth of the in-force business, as well as an increase in
    Australia due to reserve strengthening on a block of business in
    the prior year. South Korea’s income from continuing
    operations increased due to growth in the in-force business and
    the implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system.
    Higher net investment income resulting from capital



contributions, the release of liabilities for pending claims
    that were determined to be invalid following a review, the
    favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and
    inflation rates on certain contingent liabilities, the
    utilization of net operating losses for which a valuation
    allowance had been previously established, and an increase in
    the prior year period of a deferred income tax valuation
    allowance, as well as business growth, increased income from
    continuing operations in Argentina. Changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates also contributed to the increase.

Partially offsetting the decreases in income from continuing
    operations was an increase in the Auto & Home segment
    primarily due to a loss in the third quarter of 2005 related to
    Hurricane Katrina, favorable development of prior year loss
    reserves, improvement in non-catastrophe loss experience and a
    reduction in loss adjustment expenses. These increases were
    partially offset by higher catastrophe losses, excluding
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, in the current year period, and
    decreases in net earned premiums, other revenues, and net
    investment income, as well as an increase in other expenses.

Income from continuing operations in the Reinsurance segment
    increased primarily due to added business in-force from
    facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on
    existing blocks of business in the U.S. and international
    operations, an increase in net investment income due to growth
    in the invested asset base and an increase in other revenues.
    These items were partially offset by unfavorable mortality
    experience, an increase in liabilities associated with
    Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated’s
    (“RGA”) Argentine pension business in the prior period
    and an increase in other expenses, primarily related to expenses
    associated with DAC, interest expense, minority interest expense
    and equity compensation costs.

Revenues
    and Expenses

Premiums,
    Fees and Other Revenues

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $2,595 million, or 9%, to $32,554 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $29,959 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition
    of Travelers, which contributed $946 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase,
    premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $1,649 million.

The growth in the Reinsurance segment was primarily attributable
    to premiums from new facultative and automatic treaties and
    renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in the U.S. and
    international operations.

The growth in the International segment was primarily due to an
    increase in Mexico’s premiums, fees and other revenues due
    to growth in the business and higher fees, partially offset by
    an adjustment for experience refunds on a block of business and
    various one- time other revenue items in both years. In
    addition, South Korea’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    increased due to business growth, as well as the favorable
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In addition,
    Brazil’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due to
    business growth and higher bancassurance business, as well as an
    increase in amounts retained under reinsurance arrangements.
    Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher institutional premiums through its bank
    distribution channel, partially offset by lower annuity sales.
    In addition, business growth in the United Kingdom,



Argentina, Australia and Taiwan, as well as the favorable impact
    of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, contributed to
    the increase in the International segment.

The growth in the Institutional segment was primarily due to
    growth in the dental, disability, accidental death &
    dismemberment (“AD&D”) products, as well as growth
    in the long-term care (“LTC”) and individual
    disability insurance (“IDI”) businesses, all within
    the non-medical health & other business. Additionally,
    growth in the group life business is attributable to the impact
    of sales and favorable persistency largely in the term life
    business. These increases in the non-medical health &
    other and group life businesses were partially offset by a
    decrease in the retirement & savings business. The
    decline in retirement & savings was primarily due to a
    decline in premiums from structured settlements predominantly
    due to lower sales, partially offset by an increase in master
    terminal funding premiums (“MTF”).

The growth in the Individual segment was primarily due to higher
    fee income from universal life and investment-type products and
    an increase in premiums from other life products, partially
    offset by a decrease in immediate annuity premiums and a decline
    in premiums associated with the Company’s closed block
    business as this business continues to run-off.

Net
    Investment Income

Net investment income increased by $2,375 million, or 16%,
    to $17,192 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from $14,817 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed $1,473 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the year over year increase, net investment income
    increased by $902 million of which management attributes
    $666 million to growth in the average asset base and
    $236 million to an increase in yields. This increase was
    primarily due to an overall increase in the asset base, an
    increase in fixed maturity security yields, improved results on
    real estate and real estate joint ventures, mortgage loans, and
    other limited partnership interests, as well as higher
    short-term interest rates on cash equivalents and short-term
    investments. These increases were partially offset by a decline
    in investment income from securities lending results, and bond
    and commercial mortgage prepayment fees.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to PABs, decreased in the
    Institutional and Individual segments for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 as compared to the prior year. Interest
    earned approximates net investment income on investable assets
    attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the
    consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor
    non-policyholder elements. Interest credited is the amount
    attributed to insurance products, recorded in policyholder
    benefits, and the amount credited to PABs for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to PABs. Interest
    credited on insurance products reflects the current period
    impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance
    or acquisition. Interest credited to PABs is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate
    movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and, therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment losses increased by $1,257 million to a loss
    of $1,350 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from a loss of $93 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed a loss of $272 million during the first six
    months of 2006 to the year over year increase, net investment
    losses increased by $985 million. The increase in net
    investment losses was due to a combination of losses from the

mark-to-market

on derivatives and foreign currency transaction losses during
    2006, largely driven by increases in U.S. interest rates
    and the weakening of the dollar against the major currencies the
    Company hedges, notably the euro and pound sterling.

Underwriting

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity or other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related



liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity or other insurance-related experience
    trends and the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of
    business and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period.
    Underwriting results were favorable within the life products in
    the Individual segment, as well as in the Reinsurance segment,
    and in the group life and non-medical health & other
    products in the Institutional segment. Retirement &
    saving’s underwriting results were mixed across several
    products in the Institutional segment. Underwriting results,
    excluding catastrophes, in the Auto & Home segment were
    favorable for the year ended December 31, 2006, as the
    combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, decreased to 82.8% from
    86.7% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Underwriting
    results in the International segment increased commensurate with
    the growth in the business for most countries with the exception
    of Brazil which experienced unfavorable claim experience and
    Argentina which experienced improved claim experience.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $1,530 million, or 17%, to
    $10,797 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $9,267 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers, which
    contributed $612 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the year over year increase, other expenses increased by
    $918 million. The year ended December 31, 2006
    includes a $35 million contribution to the MetLife
    Foundation. The year ended December 31, 2005 included a
    $28 million benefit associated with the reduction of a
    previously established real estate transfer tax liability
    related to Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in 2000.
    Excluding these items and the acquisition of Travelers, other
    expenses increased by $855 million from the comparable 2005
    period.

The International segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to business growth
    commensurate with the increase in revenues discussed above and
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Taiwan’s other
    expenses increased due to an increase in amortization of DAC,
    due to a loss recognition adjustment, refinements associated
    with the implementation of a new valuation system and a
    restructuring charge. Mexico’s other expenses increased due
    to an increase in commissions commensurate with the revenue
    growth, higher DAC amortization, higher expenses related to
    growth initiatives and additional expenses associated with the
    Mexican pension business, partially offset by the unfavorable
    impact of contingent liabilities that were established in the
    prior year related to potential employment matters and which
    were eliminated in the current year. South Korea’s other
    expenses increased due to an increase in DAC amortization and
    general expenses, partially offset by a decrease in DAC
    amortization associated with the implementation of a more
    refined reserve valuation system. In addition, Brazil’s
    other expenses increased due to an increase in litigation
    liabilities. Other expenses associated with the home office
    increased due to an increase in expenditures for information
    technology projects, growth initiative projects and integration
    costs, as well as an increase in compensation expense. In
    addition, expenses were incurred related to the

start-up

of
    operations in Ireland.

Corporate & Other contributed to the year over year
    variance in other expenses primarily due to higher interest
    expense, corporate support expenses, interest credited to
    bankholder deposits at MetLife Bank, National Association
    (“MetLife Bank” or “MetLife Bank, N.A.”) and
    legal-related costs, partially offset by lower integration costs.



The Reinsurance segment also contributed to the increase in
    other expenses primarily due to an increase in expenses
    associated with DAC, interest expense and minority interest, as
    well as an increase in compensation, including equity
    compensation expense and overhead-related expenses.

The Institutional segment contributed to the year over year
    increase primarily due to an increase in non-deferrable
    volume-related expenses, a charge associated with costs related
    to the sale of certain small market recordkeeping businesses, a
    charge associated with non-deferrable LTC commissions expense
    and a charge associated with costs related to a previously
    announced regulatory settlement, all within the current year,
    partially offset by the reduction in Travelers-related
    integration costs, principally incentive accruals and an
    adjustment of DAC for certain LTC products.

The Auto & Home segment contributed to the year over
    year increase primarily due to expenditures related to
    information technology, advertising and compensation costs.

Partially offsetting the increases in other expenses was a
    decrease in the Individual segment. This decrease is primarily
    due to lower DAC amortization, partially offset by higher
    general spending in the current year, despite higher corporate
    incentives. In addition, the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses, premium tax, policyholder liabilities and pension and
    postretirement liabilities, in both periods, increased other
    expenses in the current year period.

Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 was
    $1,116 million, or 26% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with
    $1,228 million, or 29%, of such income, for the comparable
    2005 period. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of
    Travelers, which contributed $126 million during the first
    six months of 2006, income tax expense was $990 million, or
    26%, of income from continuing operations before provision for
    income tax, compared with $1,228 million, or 29%, of such
    income, for the comparable 2005 period. The 2006 and 2005
    effective tax rates differ from the corporate tax rate of 35%
    primarily due to the impact of non-taxable investment income and
    tax credits for investments in low income housing. The 2006
    effective tax rate also includes an adjustment of a benefit of
    $33 million consisting primarily of a revision in the
    estimate of income tax for 2005, and the 2005 effective tax rate
    also includes a tax benefit of $27 million related to the
    repatriation of foreign earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue
    Code Section 965 for which a U.S. deferred tax
    provision had previously been recorded and an adjustment of a
    benefit of $31 million consisting primarily of a revision
    in the estimate of income tax for 2004.

Income from discontinued operations consisted of net investment
    income and net investment gains related to real estate
    properties that the Company had classified as

available-for-sale

or had sold and, for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the operations and gain upon disposal from the sale of
    SSRM on January 31, 2005 and for the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the operations of MetLife Indonesia
    which was sold on September 29, 2005. Income from
    discontinued operations, net of income tax, increased by
    $1,552 million, or 95%, to $3,188 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $1,636 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. This increase is primarily due to a gain
    of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the sale of the Peter
    Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New
    York, as well as a gain of $32 million, net of income tax,
    related to the sale of SSRM during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. This increase was partially offset by
    gains during the year ended December 31, 2005 including
    $1,193 million, net of income tax, on the sales of the One
    Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in Manhattan, New
    York, as well as gains on the sales of SSRM and MetLife
    Indonesia of $177 million and $10 million,
    respectively, both net of income tax. In addition, there was
    lower net investment income and net investment gains from
    discontinued operations related to real estate properties sold
    or

held-for-sale

during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the
    year ended December 31, 2005.

Dividends on the Holding Company’s Preferred Shares issued
    in connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers
    increased by $71 million, to $134 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006, from $63 million for the
    comparable 2005 period, as the preferred stock was issued in
    June 2005.



Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — The Company

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $500 million, or 19%, to $3,078 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from $2,578 million in the
    comparable 2004 period. The current period includes
    $233 million of income from continuing operations related
    to the acquisition of Travelers. Included in the Travelers
    results is a charge for the establishment of an excess mortality
    reserve related to group of specific policies. In connection
    with MetLife, Inc.’s acquisition of Travelers, the Company
    has performed reviews of Travelers underwriting criteria in its
    effort to refine its estimated fair values for the purchase
    price allocation. As a result of these reviews and actuarial
    analyses, and to be consistent with MetLife’s existing
    reserving methodologies, the Company has established an excess
    mortality reserve on a specific group of policies. This resulted
    in a charge of $20 million, net of income tax, to fourth
    quarter results. The Company completed its reviews and refined
    its estimate of the excess mortality reserve in the second
    quarter of 2006. Excluding the acquisition of Travelers, income
    from continuing operations increased by $267 million, or
    10%. Income from continuing operations for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004 includes the impact of certain
    transactions or events, the timing, nature and amount of which
    are generally unpredictable. These transactions are described in
    each applicable segment’s discussion below. These items
    contributed a benefit of $40 million, net of income tax, to
    the year ended December 31, 2005 and a benefit of
    $96 million, net of income tax, to the comparable 2004
    period. Excluding the impact of these items, income from
    continuing operations increased by $323 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the prior 2004
    period. The Individual segment contributed $246 million,
    net of income tax, to the increase, as a result of interest rate
    spreads, increased fee income related to the growth in separate
    account products, favorable underwriting, a decrease in the
    closed block-related policyholder dividend obligation, lower
    annuity net guaranteed benefit costs and lower DAC amortization.
    These increases were partially offset by lower net investment
    income, net investment losses and higher operating costs offset
    by revisions to certain expense, premium tax and policyholder
    liability estimates in the current year and write-offs of
    certain assets in the prior year. The Institutional segment
    contributed $47 million, net of income tax, to this
    increase primarily due to favorable interest spreads, partially
    offset by a decrease in net investment gains, an adjustment
    recorded on DAC associated with certain LTC products in 2005,
    unfavorable underwriting and an increase in other expenses. The
    Auto & Home segment contributed $16 million, net
    of income tax, to the 2005 increase primarily due to
    improvements in the development of prior year claims, the
    non-catastrophe combined ratio, and losses from the involuntary
    Massachusetts automobile plan, as well as an increase in net
    investment income and earned premium. These increases in the
    Auto & Home segment were partially offset by an
    increase in catastrophes as a result of the impact of Hurricanes
    Katrina and Wilma and an increase in other expenses. The
    International segment contributed $9 million, net of income
    tax, primarily due to business growth in South Korea, Chile and
    Mexico. These increases in the International segment were
    partially offset by an increase in certain policyholder
    liabilities caused by unrealized investment gains (losses) on
    the invested assets supporting those liabilities, an increase in
    expenses for start up costs and contingency liabilities in
    Mexico, as well as a decrease in Canada primarily due to a
    realignment of economic capital offset by the strengthening of
    the liability on its pension business related to changes in
    mortality assumptions in the prior year and higher oversight and
    infrastructure expenditures in support of the segment growth.
    Corporate & Other contributed $4 million, net of
    income tax, to this increase primarily due to an increase in net
    investment income, higher net investment gains, a decrease in
    corporate support expenses and an increase in tax benefits,
    partially offset by higher interest expense on debt, integration
    costs associated with the acquisition of Travelers, higher
    interest credited on bank holder deposits and legal-related
    liabilities. The Reinsurance segment contributed
    $1 million, net of income tax, to this increase primarily
    due to premium growth and higher net investment income,
    partially offset by unfavorable mortality as a result of higher
    claim levels in the U.S. and the United Kingdom and a reduction
    in net investment gains.

Revenues
    and Expenses

Premiums,
    Fees and Other Revenues

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $3,694 million, or 14%, to $29,959 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 from $26,265 million for
    the comparable 2004 period. The current period includes
    $1,009 million of premium, fees and other revenues related
    to the acquisition of Travelers. Excluding the acquisition of



Travelers, premium, fees and other revenues increased by
    $2,685 million, or 10%. The Institutional segment
    contributed $1,266 million, or 47%, to the year over year
    increase. The Institutional segment increase is primarily due to
    sales growth and the acquisition of new business in the
    non-medical health & other business, as well as
    improved sales and favorable persistency in group life and
    higher structured settlement sales and pension close-outs in
    retirement & savings. The Reinsurance segment
    contributed $523 million, or 19%, to the Company’s
    year over year increase in premiums, fees and other revenues.
    This growth is primarily attributable to new premiums from
    facultative and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on
    existing blocks of business, as well as favorable exchange rate
    movements. The International segment contributed
    $452 million, or 17%, to the year over year increase
    primarily due to business growth through increased sales and
    renewal business in Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, and Taiwan, as
    well as changes in foreign currency rates. In addition,
    Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due to
    the new bank distribution channel established in 2005. The
    Individual segment contributed $446 million, or 17%, to the
    year over year increase primarily due to higher fee income from
    variable annuity and universal life products, active marketing
    of income annuity products and growth in the business in
    traditional life products. The growth in traditional products
    more than offset the decline in premiums in the Company’s
    closed block business as this business continues to run-off.
    Corporate & Other contributed $37 million, or 1%,
    to the year over year increase, primarily due to intersegment
    eliminations. The increase in premiums, fees and other revenues
    were partially offset by a decrease in the Auto & Home
    segment of $39 million, or 1%. This decrease is primarily
    attributable to reinstatement and additional reinsurance-related
    premiums due to Hurricane Katrina.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to PABs, increased in the
    Institutional and Individual segments for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 as compared to the prior year. Interest
    earned approximates net investment income on investable assets
    attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the
    consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor
    non-policyholder elements. Interest credited is the amount
    attributed to insurance products, recorded in policyholder
    benefits, and the amount credited to PABs for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to PABs. Interest
    credited on insurance products reflects the current period
    impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance
    or acquisition. Interest credited to PABs is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate
    movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and, therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

Underwriting

Underwriting results were favorable within the life products in
    the Individual and Institutional segments, while underwriting
    results were unfavorable in the Reinsurance segment and in the
    retirement & savings and non medical health &
    other products within the Institutional segment. Underwriting
    results are generally the difference between the portion of
    premium and fee income intended to cover mortality, morbidity or
    other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and the change in
    insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting results are
    significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity or other
    insurance-related experience trends and the reinsurance activity
    related to certain blocks of business and, as a result, can
    fluctuate from period to period. Underwriting results, excluding
    catastrophes, in the Auto & Home segment were favorable
    for the year ended December 31, 2005, as the combined
    ratio, excluding catastrophes and before the reinstatement
    premiums and other reinsurance related premium adjustments due
    to Hurricane Katrina, decreased to 86.7% from 90.4% in the prior
    year period. Offsetting the improved non-catastrophe ratios in
    the Auto & Home segment was an increase in catastrophes
    primarily due to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma. Underwriting
    results in the International segment increased commensurate with
    the growth in the business as discussed above.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $1,454 million, or 19%, to
    $9,267 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $7,813 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    current period includes $618 million of other expenses
    related to the acquisition of Travelers. Excluding the
    acquisition of Travelers, other expenses increased by



$836 million, or 11%. The year ended December 31, 2005
    includes a $28 million benefit associated with the
    reduction of a previously established real estate transfer tax
    liability related to Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in
    2000. The year ended December 31, 2004 reflects a
    $49 million reduction of a premium tax liability and a
    $22 million reduction of a liability for interest
    associated with the resolution of all issues relating to the
    Internal Revenue Service’s audit of Metropolitan
    Life’s and its subsidiaries’ tax returns for the years

1997-1999.

These decreases were partially offset by a $50 million
    contribution of appreciated stock to the MetLife Foundation.
    Excluding the impact of these transactions, other expenses
    increased by $843 million, or 11%, from the comparable 2004
    period. Corporate & Other contributed
    $412 million, or 49%, to the year over year variance
    primarily due to higher interest expense, integration costs
    associated with the Travelers acquisition, growth in interest
    credited to bank holder deposits at MetLife Bank and
    legal-related liabilities, partially offset by a reduction in
    corporate support expenses. The Institutional segment
    contributed $178 million, or 21%, to the year over year
    variance primarily due to higher non-deferrable volume-related
    expenses associated with general business growth, corporate
    support expenses, higher expenses related to additional
    Travelers incentive accruals, as well as an adjustment recorded
    on DAC associated with certain LTC products in 2005. In
    addition, $174 million, or 21%, of this increase is
    primarily attributable to higher amortization of DAC, changes in
    foreign currency rates, business growth commensurate with the
    increase in revenues discussed above, a decrease in the payroll
    tax liability and an accrual for an early retirement program in
    the International segment. Other expenses in the International
    segment also increased due to higher consultant fees for growth
    initiative projects, an increase in compensation and incentive
    expenses, as well as higher costs for legal, marketing and other
    corporate allocated expenses. The Reinsurance segment also
    contributed $34 million, or 4%, to the increase in other
    expenses primarily due to an increase in the amortization of
    DAC. The Auto & Home segment contributed
    $33 million, or 4%, to this increase primarily due to
    increased information technology, advertising and incentive and
    other compensation costs. In addition, the Individual segment
    contributed $12 million, or 1%, to the year over year
    increase primarily due to higher corporate incentive expenses
    and general spending, partially offset by the revision of prior
    period estimates for certain expense, premium tax and
    policyholder liabilities, as well as certain asset write-offs in
    the prior year and lower DAC amortization.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment gains (losses) decreased by $268 million, or
    153%, to a loss of $93 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 from a net investment gain of
    $175 million for the comparable 2004 period. The current
    year includes $208 million of net investment losses related
    to the acquisition of Travelers. Excluding the acquisition of
    Travelers, net investment gains (losses) decreased by
    $60 million, or 34%. This decrease is primarily due to
    losses on fixed maturity security sales resulting from continued
    portfolio repositioning in the 2005 period. Significantly
    offsetting these reductions is an increase in gains from the

mark-to-market

on derivatives in 2005. The derivative gains resulted from
    changes in the value of the dollar versus major foreign
    currencies, including the euro and pound sterling, and changes
    in U.S. interest rates during the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 is
    $1,228 million, or 29% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with
    $996 million, or 28%, for the comparable 2004 period. The
    current period includes $80 million of income tax expense
    related to the acquisition of Travelers. Excluding the
    acquisition of Travelers, income tax expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 is $1,148 million, or 29% of income
    from continuing operations before provision for income tax,
    compared with $996 million, or 28%, for the comparable 2004
    period. The 2005 effective tax rate differs from the corporate
    tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of non-taxable
    investment income and tax credits for investments in low income
    housing. In addition, the 2005 effective tax rate reflects a tax
    benefit of $27 million related to the repatriation of
    foreign earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue Code
    Section 965 for which a U.S. deferred tax provision
    had previously been recorded and an adjustment of a benefit of
    $31 million consisting primarily of a revision in the
    estimate of income tax for 2004 had been made. The 2004
    effective tax rate differs from the corporate tax rate of 35%
    primarily due to the impact of non-taxable investment income,
    tax credits for investments in low income housing, a decrease in
    the deferred tax valuation allowance to recognize the effect of
    certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards in South Korea,
    and the contribution of appreciated stock to the MetLife
    Foundation. In addition,



the 2004 effective tax rate reflects an adjustment for the
    resolution of all issues relating to the Internal Revenue
    Service’s audit of Metropolitan Life’s and its
    subsidiaries’ tax returns for the years

1997-1999

of
    $91 million and an adjustment of a benefit of
    $9 million consisting primarily of a revision in the
    estimate of income tax for 2003.

Income from discontinued operations is comprised of the
    operations and the gain upon disposal from the sale of MetLife
    Indonesia on September 29, 2005 and SSRM on
    January 31, 2005, as well as net investment income and net
    investment gains related to real estate properties that the
    Company has classified as

available-for-sale

or has sold. Income from discontinued operations, net of income
    tax, increased by $1,370 million to $1,636 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 from $266 million for
    the comparable 2004 period. This increase is primarily due to a
    gain of $1,193 million, net of income tax, on the sales of
    the One Madison Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in
    Manhattan, New York, and the gains on the sales of SSRM and
    MetLife Indonesia of $177 million and $10 million,
    respectively, both net of income tax, in the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Partially offsetting this increase is
    the gain on the sale of the Sears Tower property of
    $85 million, net of income tax, in the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
    recorded an $86 million charge, net of income tax, for a
    cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in
    accordance with

SOP 03-1,

which provides guidance on (i) the classification and
    valuation of long-duration contract liabilities; (ii) the
    accounting for sales inducements; and (iii) separate
    account presentation and valuation. This charge is primarily
    related to those long-duration contract liabilities where the
    amount of the liability is indexed to the performance of a
    target portfolio of investment securities.

In addition, during the second half of the year ended
    December 31, 2005, the Holding Company paid
    $63 million in dividends on its Preferred Shares issued in
    connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased $262 million,
    or 19%, to $1,126 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $1,388 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers contributed
    $56 million during the first six months of 2006 to income
    from continuing operations, which included a decline of
    $104 million, net of income tax, of net investment gains
    (losses). Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased $318 million, or 23%, from
    the comparable 2005 period.

Included in this decrease was a decline of $300 million,
    net of income tax, in net investment gains (losses), as well as
    a decline of $18 million, net of income tax, resulting from
    an increase in policyholder benefits and claims related to net
    investment gains (losses). Excluding the impact of Travelers and
    the decline in net investment gains (losses), income from
    continuing operations was flat when compared to the prior year
    period.

A decrease in interest margins of $84 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year period contributed to the
    decrease in income from continuing operations. Management
    attributes this decrease primarily to the group life and
    retirement & savings businesses of $60 million and
    $51 million, both net of income tax, respectively.
    Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of
    $27 million, net of income tax, in the non-medical
    health & other business. Interest margin is the
    difference between interest earned and interest credited to
    PABs. Interest



earned approximates net investment income on investable assets
    attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the
    consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor
    non-policyholder elements. Interest credited is the amount
    attributed to insurance products, recorded in
    policyholder’s benefits, and the amount credited to PABs
    for investment-type products, recorded in interest credited to
    PABs. Interest credited on insurance products reflects the
    current period impact of the interest rate assumptions
    established at issuance or acquisition. Interest credited to
    PABs is subject to contractual terms, including some minimum
    guarantees. This tends to move gradually over time to reflect
    market interest rate movements, may reflect actions by
    management to respond to competitive pressures and therefore,
    generally does not introduce volatility in expense.

The year over year variance in income from continuing operations
    included charges recorded in other expenses of $17 million,
    net of income tax, associated with costs related to the sale of
    certain small market recordkeeping businesses, $16 million,
    net of income tax, due to costs associated with a previously
    announced regulatory settlement and $15 million, net of
    income tax, associated with non-deferrable LTC commission
    expense. Partially offsetting these increases in operating
    expenses were benefits due to prior year charges of
    $28 million, net of income tax, as a result of the impact
    of Travelers’ integration costs and $14 million, net
    of income tax, related to an adjustment of DAC for certain LTC
    products.

Partially offsetting these decreases in income from continuing
    operations was an increase in underwriting results of
    $97 million, net of income tax, compared to the prior year
    period. This increase was primarily due to favorable results of
    $48 million, $38 million and $11 million, all net
    of income tax, in the group life, the non-medical
    health & other businesses and the retirement &
    savings businesses, respectively.

The results in group life were primarily due to favorable
    mortality results, predominantly in the term life business,
    which included a benefit from reserve refinements in the current
    year.

Non-medical health & other’s favorable
    underwriting results were primarily due to improvements in the
    IDI and dental businesses. The IDI results included certain
    reserve refinements in the prior year. Partially offsetting
    these increases was a decrease in the AD&D and disability
    businesses. Disability’s results include the benefit of
    prior and current year reserve refinements.

Retirement & savings’ underwriting results were
    favorable with mixed underwriting across several products.
    Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity, or other insurance costs less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity, or
    other insurance-related experience trends and the reinsurance
    activity related to certain blocks of business.

The remaining increase in operating expenses more than offset
    the remaining increase in premiums, fees and other revenues.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,839 million, or 10%, to
    $20,594 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $18,755 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $797 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition, such revenues
    increased by $1,042 million, or 6%, from the comparable
    2005 period. This increase was comprised of higher net
    investment income of $584 million and growth in premiums,
    fees and other revenues of $458 million.

Net investment income increased by $584 million of which
    management attributes $464 million to growth in the average
    asset base driven by business growth throughout 2005 and 2006,
    particularly in the GIC and structured settlement businesses and
    $120 million to an increase in yields. The increase in
    yields is primarily attributable to higher yields on fixed
    maturity securities, an increase in short-term rates and higher
    returns on joint ventures. These increases were partially offset
    by a decline in securities lending results and commercial
    mortgage prepayment fees.

The increase of $458 million in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was largely due to increases in the non-medical
    health & other business of $408 million, primarily
    due to growth in the dental, disability and AD&D products of
    $255 million. In addition, continued growth in the LTC and
    IDI businesses contributed $117 million and



$25 million, respectively. Group life increased by
    $296 million, which management primarily attributes to the
    impact of sales and favorable persistency largely in term life
    business, which includes a significant increase in premiums from
    two large customers. Partially offsetting these increases was a
    decline in retirement & savings’ premiums, fees
    and other revenues of $246 million, resulting primarily
    from a decline of $320 million in structured settlements,
    predominantly due to the impact of lower sales. This decline was
    partially offset by a $83 million increase in MTF premiums.
    Premiums, fees and other revenues from retirement &
    savings products are significantly influenced by large
    transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to
    period.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,616 million, or 10%, to
    $18,274 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $16,658 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $551 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition, total
    expenses increased $1,065 million, or 6%, from the
    comparable 2005 period.

The increase in expenses was attributable to higher interest
    credited to PABs of $621 million, policyholder benefits and
    claims of $366 million and operating expenses of
    $79 million.

Management attributes the increase of $621 million in
    interest credited to PABs to $433 million from an increase
    in average crediting rates, which was largely due to the impact
    of higher short-term rates in the current year period and
    $188 million solely from growth in the average PAB,
    primarily resulting from GICs within the retirement &
    savings business.

The increases in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $366 million included a $27 million increase related
    to net investment gains (losses). Excluding the increase related
    to net investment gains (losses), policyholder benefits and
    claims increased by $339 million. Non-medical
    health & other’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $306 million, predominantly due to the
    aforementioned growth in business, as well as unfavorable
    morbidity in disability and unfavorable claim experience in
    AD&D. Partially offsetting these increases was favorable
    claim and morbidity experience in IDI, as well as the impact of
    an establishment of a $25 million liability for future
    losses in the prior year. In addition, favorable claim
    experience in the current year reduced dental policyholder
    benefits and claims. Additionally, disability business included
    a $22 million benefit which resulted from reserve
    refinements in the current year. The year over year variance in
    disability also includes the impact of an $18 million loss
    related to Hurricane Katrina in the prior year. Group
    life’s policyholder benefits and claims increased by
    $238 million, largely due to the aforementioned growth in
    the business, partially offset by favorable underwriting
    results, particularly in the term life business. Term life
    included a benefit of $16 million due to reserve
    refinements in the current year. Partially offsetting the
    increase was a retirement & savings’ policyholder
    benefits and claims decrease of $205 million, predominantly
    due to the aforementioned decrease in revenues, partially offset
    by higher FAS 60 interest credits recorded in policyholder
    benefits and claims due to growth in structured settlements and
    MTF.

The increase in other expenses of $79 million was primarily
    due to an increase in the current year of $60 million in
    non-deferrable volume related expenses and corporate support
    expenses. Non-deferrable volume related expenses include those
    expenses associated with information technology, direct
    departmental spending and commission expenses. Corporate support
    expenses include advertising, corporate overhead and consulting
    fees. Also contributing to the increase was $26 million
    associated with costs related to the sale of certain small
    market recordkeeping businesses, $23 million of
    non-deferrable LTC commission expense, $24 million related
    to costs associated with a previously announced regulatory
    settlement and $11 million related to stock-based
    compensation. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits
    due to prior year charges of $43 million in
    Travelers-related integration costs, principally incentive
    accruals and $22 million related to an adjustment of DAC
    for certain LTC products.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — Institutional

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $89 million,
    or 7%, to $1,388 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 from $1,299 million for the
    comparable 2004 period. The acquisition of Travelers accounted
    for



$73 million of this increase, which includes
    $57 million, net of income tax, of net investment losses.
    Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition, income from
    continuing operations increased by $16 million, or 1%, from
    the comparable 2004 period.

An increase in interest margins of $124 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year period contributed to the
    increase in income from continuing operations. Management
    attributed this increase primarily to the retirement &
    savings and the non-medical health & other businesses
    of $81 million and $44 million, both net of income
    tax, respectively. Interest margin is the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to PABs. Interest earned
    approximates net investment income on investable assets
    attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the
    consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor
    non-policyholder elements. Interest credited is the amount
    attributed to insurance products, recorded in policyholder
    benefits, and the amount credited to PABs for investment-type
    products recorded in interest credited to PABs. Interest
    credited on insurance products reflects the current period
    impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance
    or acquisition. Interest credited to PABs is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate
    movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

The increase in interest margins was partially offset by a
    decrease of $57 million, net of income tax, in net
    investment gains (losses), which was partially offset by a
    decrease of $10 million, net of income tax, in policyholder
    benefits and claims related to net investment gains (losses).

Also contributing to the decline in income from continuing
    operations was a $14 million charge, net of income tax,
    related to an adjustment recorded on DAC associated with certain
    LTC products in 2005 and a reduction of a premium tax liability
    of $31 million, net of income tax, recorded in 2004.

Underwriting results decreased by $7 million, net of income
    tax, compared to the prior year. This decline was primarily due
    to less favorable results of $27 million, net of income
    tax, in retirement & savings and a $24 million,
    net of income tax, decrease in non-medical health &
    other. These unfavorable results were partially offset by an
    improvement of $44 million, net of income tax, in group
    life’s underwriting results, primarily due to favorable
    claim experience. Underwriting results are generally the
    difference between the portion of premium and fee income
    intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance costs
    less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends and the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of
    business and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period.

In addition, increases in operating expenses, which included
    higher expenses related to the Travelers integration, had more
    than offset the remaining growth in premiums, fees and other
    revenues.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $2,787 million, or 17%, to
    $18,755 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $15,968 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $855 million of this
    increase. Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition,
    total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,932 million, or 12%, from the comparable
    2004 period.

This increase was comprised of growth in premiums, fees and
    other revenues of $1,266 million and higher net investment
    income of $666 million. The increase of $1,266 million
    in premiums, fees, and other revenues was largely due to an
    increase in non-medical health & other of
    $520 million, primarily due to growth in the disability,
    dental and AD&D products of $360 million. In addition,
    continued growth in the LTC business contributed
    $138 million, of which $25 million was related to the
    2004 acquisition of TIAA-CREF’s LTC business. Group life
    insurance premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $481 million, which management primarily attributed to
    improved sales and favorable persistency, as well as a
    significant increase in premiums from two large customers.
    Retirement & savings’ premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased by $265 million, which was largely due
    to growth in premiums, resulting primarily from an increase of
    $166 million in structured settlement sales and



$107 million in pension close-outs. Premiums, fees and
    other revenues from retirement & savings products are
    significantly influenced by large transactions, and as a result,
    can fluctuate from period to period.

The increase in net investment income of $666 million,
    management attributed to $439 million solely from growth in
    the average asset base, primarily driven by sales, particularly
    in GICs and the structured settlement business and
    $227 million from an increase in higher income from
    corporate and real estate joint ventures interest on the growth
    of allocated capital, and securities lending activities across
    the businesses and higher short-term interest rates.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $2,497 million, or 18%, to
    $16,658 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $14,161 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $658 million of this
    increase. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers,
    total expenses increased by $1,839 million, or 13%, from
    the comparable 2004 period. This increase was comprised of
    higher policyholder benefits and claims of $1,278 million,
    an increase in interest credited to PABs of $334 million
    and an increase in other expenses of $227 million.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $1,278 million was attributable to a $482 million, a
    $452 million, and a $344 million increase in the
    non-medical health & other, group life, and
    retirement & savings businesses, respectively. These
    increases were predominantly attributable to the business growth
    referenced in the revenue discussion above. The increase in
    policyholder benefits and claims in the non-medical
    health & other business included the impact of the
    acquisition of TIAA-CREF’s LTC business of
    $43 million. These increases included $2 million and
    $18 million of policyholder benefits and claims related to
    Hurricane Katrina in the group life and non-medical
    health & other business, respectively.

Management attributed the increase in interest credited to PABs
    of $334 million to $229 million from an increase in
    average crediting rates, which was largely due to the impact of
    higher short-term rates in the current year period and
    $105 million solely from growth in the average PAB,
    primarily resulting from GICs within the retirement &
    savings business.

The rise in other expenses of $227 million was primarily
    due to higher non-deferrable volume-related expenses of
    $61 million, which were largely associated with business
    growth, an increase of $39 million in corporate support
    expenses, and $43 million of Travelers-related integration
    costs, principally incentive accruals. In addition, expenses
    increased as a result of the impact of a $49 million
    benefit recorded in the second quarter of 2004, which was
    related to a reduction in a premium tax liability. Expenses also
    increased by $22 million related to an adjustment of DAC
    for certain LTC products in 2005.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Individual

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $44 million,
    or 4%, to $1,246 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $1,202 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers contributed
    $112 million during the first six months of 2006 to income
    from continuing operations, which included $88 million, net
    of income tax, of net investment losses. Included in the
    Travelers results was a $21 million increase to the excess
    mortality liability on specific blocks of life insurance
    policies. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased by $68 million, or 6%, to
    $1,134 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $1,202 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Included in this decrease were net investment losses of
    $270 million, net of income tax. Excluding the impact of
    net investment gains (losses) and the acquisition of Travelers
    for the first six months of 2006, income from continuing
    operations increased by $202 million from the comparable
    2005 period.

Fee income from separate account products increased income from
    continuing operations by $151 million, net of income tax,
    primarily related to fees being earned on a higher average
    account balance resulting from a combination of growth in the
    business and overall market performance.

Favorable underwriting results in life products contributed
    $125 million, net of income tax, to the increase in income
    from continuing operations. Underwriting results are generally
    the difference between the portion of premium and fee income
    intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance costs
    less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or



other insurance-related experience trends and the reinsurance
    activity related to certain blocks of business and, as a result,
    can fluctuate from period to period.

Lower DAC amortization resulting from investment losses and
    adjustments for management’s update of assumptions used to
    determine estimated gross margins contributed $113 million,
    net of income tax, to the increase in income from continuing
    operations.

Higher net investment income on blocks of business that were not
    driven by interest margins of $16 million, net of income
    tax, also contributed to the increase in income from continuing
    operations.

The decrease in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $4 million, net of income tax, also
    contributed to the increase in income from continuing operations.

These aforementioned increases in income from continuing
    operations were partially offset by a decline in interest
    margins of $58 million, net of income tax. Interest margin
    relates primarily to the general account portion of
    investment-type products. Management attributed $40 million
    of this decrease to the deferred annuity business and the
    remaining $18 million to other investment-type products.
    Interest margin is the difference between interest earned and
    interest credited to PABs related to the general account on
    these businesses. Interest earned approximates net investment
    income on invested assets attributed to these businesses with
    net adjustments for other non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited approximates the amount recorded in interest credited
    to PABs. Interest credited to PABs is subject to contractual
    terms, including some minimum guarantees, and may reflect
    actions by management to respond to competitive pressures.
    Interest credited to PABs tends to move gradually over time to
    reflect market interest rate movements, subject to any minimum
    guarantees, and therefore, generally does not introduce
    volatility in expense.

In addition, the increase in income from continuing operations
    was partially offset by higher expenses of $52 million, net
    of income tax. Higher general spending in the current period was
    partially offset by higher corporate incentives in the prior
    year.

Also partially offsetting the increase in income from continuing
    operations were higher annuity benefits of $30 million, net
    of income tax, primarily due to higher costs of the guaranteed
    annuity benefit riders and the related hedging, and revisions to
    future policyholder benefits.

In addition, the increase in income from continuing operations
    was partially offset by an increase to interest credited to PABs
    due primarily to lower amortization of the excess interest
    reserves on annuity and universal life blocks of business of
    $26 million, net of income tax.

An increase in policyholder dividends of $18 million, net
    of income tax, due to growth in the business also partially
    offset the increase in income from continuing operations.

The change in effective tax rates between periods accounts for
    the remainder of the increase in income from continuing
    operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,184 million, or 8%, to $15,156 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $13,972 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $1,009 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, such revenues increased by
    $175 million, or 1%, from the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums decreased by $38 million due to a decrease in
    immediate annuity premiums of $22 million, and a
    $103 million expected decline in premiums associated with
    the Company’s closed block of business, partially offset by
    growth in premiums from other life products of $87 million.

Higher universal life and investment-type product policy fees
    combined with other revenues of $267 million resulted from
    a combination of growth in the business and improved overall
    market performance. Policy fees from variable life and annuity
    and investment-type products are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts. The
    value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity
    performance.



Net investment income decreased by
    $54 million.  Net investment income from the
    general account portion of investment type products decreased by
    $56 million which was partially offset by an increase of
    $2 million in other businesses. Management attributed a
    decrease of $146 million partially to lower yields in the
    current year primarily resulting from lower income from
    securities lending activities, mortgage and bond prepayment fee
    income, partially offset by higher corporate joint venture
    income. In addition, management attributed an increase of
    $92 million from growth in the average asset base primarily
    from equity securities and mortgage loans.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $534 million, or 4%, to
    $12,660 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $12,126 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $706 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Included in the Travelers results was a $33 million
    increase to the excess mortality liability on specific blocks of
    life insurance policies. Excluding the impact of Travelers,
    total expenses decreased by $172 million, or 1%, from the
    comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits decreased by $156 million primarily
    due to favorable mortality in the life products of
    $109 million, as well as a reduction in reserves of
    $49 million related to the excess mortality liability on a
    specific block of life insurance policies that lapsed or
    otherwise changed. Also, policyholder benefits decreased due to
    a reduction in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $6 million driven by higher net investment
    losses. In addition, policyholder benefits decreased
    commensurate with the premium decreases in both immediate
    annuities and the Company’s closed block of business of
    $22 million and $103 million, respectively. Partially
    offsetting this decline in benefits was an increase commensurate
    with the increase in premiums of $87 million from other
    life products. Partially offsetting these decreases in
    policyholder benefits was an increase in annuity benefits of
    $46 million primarily due to higher costs of the guaranteed
    annuity benefit riders and the related hedging, and revisions to
    future policyholder benefits.

Partially offsetting these decreases, interest credited to PABs
    increased by $51 million. Lower amortization of the excess
    interest reserves on acquired annuity and universal life blocks
    of business resulting from higher lapses in the prior period, as
    well as an update of assumptions in the current period
    contributed $40 million to the increase. In addition, there
    was an increase of $16 million on the general account
    portion of investment type products. Management attributed this
    increase to higher crediting rates of $37 million,
    partially offset by $21 million due to lower average PABs.

Partially offsetting these decreases in total expenses was a
    $27 million increase in policyholder dividends associated
    with growth in the business.

Lower other expenses of $94 million include lower DAC
    amortization of $174 million resulting from changes in
    investment gains and losses of $154 million and
    $20 million related to management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross margins. Excluding
    DAC amortization, other expenses increased by $80 million.
    The current year period included higher general spending of
    $94 million primarily due to information technology and
    travel expenses while the prior year period had higher corporate
    incentives of $39 million related to the Travelers
    integration. In addition, the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses, premium tax, policyholder liabilities and pension and
    postretirement liabilities in both periods was a net increase to
    expenses of $25 million in the current period.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — Individual

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $342 million, or 40%, to $1,202 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from $860 million for the
    comparable 2004 period. The acquisition of Travelers accounted
    for $96 million of the increase which included
    $66 million, net of income tax, of net investment losses.
    Included in the Travelers results was a charge for the
    establishment of an excess mortality reserve related to group of
    specific policies. In connection with MetLife’s acquisition
    of Travelers, the Company had performed reviews of Travelers
    underwriting criteria in an effort to refine its estimated fair
    values for the purchase allocation. As a result of these reviews
    and actuarial analyses, and to be consistent with MetLife’s
    existing reserving methodologies, the Company



has established an excess mortality reserve on a specific group
    of policies. This resulted in a charge of $20 million, net
    of income tax, to fourth quarter results. The Company completed
    its reviews and refined its estimate of the excess mortality
    reserve in the second quarter of 2006. Excluding the impact of
    the acquisition of Travelers, income from continuing operations
    increased by $246 million, or 29%, for the comparable 2004
    period. Included in this increase were net investment losses of
    $26 million, net of income tax.

An increase in interest margins of $117 million, net of
    income tax, compared to the prior year period contributed to the
    increase in income from continuing operations. Interest margin
    relates primarily to the general account portion of
    investment-type products. Management attributed $92 million
    of this increase to the deferred annuity business and the
    remainder of $25 million to the other investment-type
    products. Interest margin is the difference between interest
    earned and interest credited to PABs related to the general
    account on these businesses. Interest earned approximates net
    investment income on invested assets attributed to these
    businesses with net adjustments for other non-policyholder
    elements. Interest credited approximates the amount recorded in
    interest credited to PABs. Interest credited to PABs is subject
    to contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees, and may
    reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures. Interest credited to PABs tends to move gradually
    over time to reflect market interest rate movements, subject to
    any minimum guarantees, and therefore, generally does not
    introduce volatility in expense.

Fee income from separate account products increased by
    $126 million, net of income tax, primarily related to
    growth in the business and favorable market conditions.

Favorable underwriting results in life products contributed
    $37 million, net of income tax, to the increase in income
    from continuing operations. Underwriting results are generally
    the difference between the portion of premium and fee income
    intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance costs
    less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends and the reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of
    business and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period.

The decrease in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $27 million, net of income tax, lower annuity
    net guaranteed benefit costs of $12 million, net of income
    tax, and lower DAC amortization of $6 million, net of
    income tax, all contributed to the increase.

These increases in income from continuing operations were
    partially offset by lower net investment income on blocks of
    business that are not driven by interest margins of
    $17 million, net of income tax.

The increase in income from continuing operations was partially
    offset by higher expenses of $10 million, net of income
    tax, primarily due to higher operating costs offset by the
    impact of revisions to certain expense, premium tax and
    policyholder liability estimates in the current year and certain
    asset write-offs in the prior year.

Additionally, offsetting the increase in income from continuing
    operations was a revision to the estimate for policyholder
    dividends of $9 million, net of income tax, which occurred
    in the prior year.

The changes in tax rates between years accounted for a decrease
    in income from continuing operations of $15 million.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,532 million, or 12%, to
    $13,972 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $12,440 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $975 million of the
    increase. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Travelers,
    total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses)
    increased by $557 million, or 4%, to $12,997 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $12,440 million for the comparable 2004 period.

This increase included higher fee income primarily from variable
    annuity and universal life products of $239 million
    resulting from a combination of growth in the business and
    improved overall market performance. Policy fees from variable
    life and annuity and investment-type products are typically
    calculated as a percentage of the average assets in policyholder
    accounts. The value of these assets can fluctuate depending on
    equity performance.



In addition, management attributed higher premiums of
    $170 million in 2005 to the active marketing of income
    annuity products. Although premiums associated with the
    Company’s closed block of business continue to decline, as
    expected, by $94 million, an increase in premiums of
    $130 million from other life products more than offset the
    decline of the closed block. Included in the premium increase of
    the other life products was the impact of growth in the business
    and a new reinsurance strategy where more business was retained.

Net investment income increased by $111 million. Net
    investment income from the general account portion of
    investment-type products increased by $136 million, which
    was partially offset by a decrease of $25 million on other
    businesses. Management attributed $75 million of this
    increase to corporate and real estate joint venture income and
    bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees partially offset by
    a decline in bond yields, as well as $61 million due to
    growth in the average asset base.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $881 million, or 8%, to
    $12,126 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $11,245 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $761 million of the
    increase. Excluding the impact from the acquisition of
    Travelers, total expenses increased by $120 million, or 1%,
    to $11,365 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005 from $11,245 million for the comparable 2004 period.

Higher expenses were primarily the result of higher policyholder
    benefits primarily due to the increase in future policy benefits
    of $207 million, commensurate with the net increase in
    premium on annuity and life products discussed above, partially
    offset by $5 million due to better mortality in life
    products.

Also partially offsetting the increase in policyholder benefits
    was a reduction in the closed block-related policyholder
    dividend obligation of $41 million and a benefit of
    $18 million associated with the hedging of guaranteed
    annuity benefit riders. The reduction in the closed
    block-related policyholder dividend obligation was driven by
    lower net investment income, offset by higher realized gains in
    the closed block.

Interest credited to PABs decreased by $45 million due
    primarily to a $41 million decrease on the general account
    portion of investment-type products. Management attributed this
    decrease to lower crediting rates of $91 million partially
    offset by $50 million solely due to growth in the average
    PABs. In addition, total expenses increased by $13 million
    due to a revision in the estimate of policyholder dividends in
    the prior period.

Other expenses increased primarily due to higher corporate
    incentive expenses of $60 million and higher general
    spending of $28 million. The current year included
    revisions to prior period estimates for certain expense, premium
    tax and policyholder liabilities which reduced the current year
    expenses while the prior period included certain asset
    write-offs which increased the prior year expenses. The impact
    of these two items resulted in a decrease in other expenses of
    $73 million. Also offsetting the increase in other expenses
    was lower DAC amortization of $9 million resulting from net
    investment losses and adjustments for management’s update
    of assumptions used to determine estimated gross margins
    partially offset by growth in the business.

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $192 million, or 86%, to
    $416 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $224 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to a loss
    in the third quarter of 2005 from Hurricane Katrina of
    $124 million, net of income tax, related to losses, loss
    adjusting expenses and reinstatement and additional
    reinsurance-related premiums and a loss in the fourth quarter of
    2005 related to losses and expenses from Hurricane Wilma of
    $32 million, net of income tax. Excluding the losses from
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, net income increased by
    $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    the comparable 2005 period.

Favorable development of prior year loss reserves contributed
    $72 million, net of income tax, to the increase in net
    income. In addition, an improvement in non-catastrophe loss
    experience, primarily due to improved frequencies, contributed
    $16 million, net of income tax and a reduction in loss
    adjustment expenses, primarily due to improved claims handling
    practices, contributed $13 million, net of income tax, to
    the increase. The increase in net income was offset by higher
    catastrophe losses in the current year, excluding the impact of
    Katrina and Wilma, resulting in a decrease to net income of
    $49 million, net of income tax.

Also impacting net income was a decrease in net earned premiums,
    excluding the impact of Hurricane Katrina, of $19 million,
    net of income tax, resulting primarily from an increase of
    $16 million, net of income tax, in catastrophe reinsurance
    costs and a reduction of $4 million, net of income tax, in
    involuntary assumed business, offset by an increase in premiums
    of $1 million, net of income tax, primarily from increased
    exposures, mostly offset by lower average premium per policy.

In addition, other revenues decreased by $7 million, net of
    income tax, due to slower than anticipated claims payments
    resulting in slower recognition of deferred income related to a
    reinsurance contract. Net investment income decreased by
    $3 million, net of income tax, due to a $12 million
    decrease in net investment income related to a realignment of
    economic capital, partially offset by a $9 million increase
    in income as a result of a slightly higher



asset base. Net investment gains (losses) increased
    $10 million, net of income tax, for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to the comparable 2005 period.
    Other expenses increased by $11 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to expenditures related to information technology,
    advertising and compensation costs.

The change in effective tax rates between periods accounted for
    the remainder of the increase in net income.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $2 million, or less than 1%, to
    $3,123 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $3,125 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums increased by $13 million due principally to the
    existence of a $43 million charge for reinstatement and
    additional reinsurance premiums in the third quarter of 2005
    related to Hurricane Katrina. Premiums decreased by
    $30 million year over year after giving consideration to
    this charge. This decrease resulted from $25 million in
    additional catastrophe reinsurance costs and a decrease of
    $6 million in involuntary assumed business in 2006, mainly
    associated with the Massachusetts involuntary market. These
    changes were partially offset by an increase in premiums of
    $35 million resulting from increased exposures, offset by a
    $34 million decrease in premiums from a change in the
    average earned premium per policy.

Net investment income decreased by $4 million primarily due
    to an $18 million decrease in net investment income related
    to a realignment of economic capital, mostly offset by a
    $14 million increase in income as a result of a slightly
    higher asset base with slightly higher yields.

Other revenues decreased by $11 million due to slower than
    anticipated claims payments resulting in a slower recognition of
    deferred income related to a reinsurance contract.

Expenses

Total expenses decreased by $257 million, or 9%, to
    $2,568 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $2,825 million for the comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims decreased by $277 million
    which was primarily due to $196 million in claims and
    expenses related to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma incurred in
    2005. The remainder of the decrease in policyholder benefits and
    claims for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to
    the same period in 2005, can be attributed to $111 million
    in additional favorable development of prior year losses,
    improvements in claim frequencies of $72 million and a
    decrease of $20 million in unallocated loss expense due
    primarily to improved claims handling practices. These decreases
    in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to the same period in 2005,
    were partially offset by $32 million of additional losses
    due to severity, $15 million of additional losses due to
    exposure growth and a $75 million increase in catastrophe
    losses, excluding Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma.

Other expenses increased by $17 million primarily due to
    expenditures related to information technology, advertising and
    compensation costs.

Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, as the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, decreased to 82.8% from 86.7% for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended

    Home

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $16 million, or 8%, to
    $224 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $208 million for the comparable 2004 period.

The increase was primarily the result of improvements in the
    development of prior years claims of $40 million, net of
    income tax, and an improvement in the non-catastrophe combined
    ratio resulting in $16 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to lower automobile and homeowner claim
    frequencies.



Also contributing to this increase in net income was an
    improvement in losses from the involuntary Massachusetts
    automobile plan of $12 million, net of income tax, an
    increase in net investment income of $6 million, net of
    income tax, and an increase in earned premium of
    $4 million, net of income tax, as discussed below.

Offsetting these improved results, was an increase in
    catastrophes, including Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma of
    $63 million, net of income tax.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $29 million, or 1%, to $3,125 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 from $3,154 million
    for the comparable 2004 period.

This decrease was primarily attributable to reinstatement and
    additional reinsurance-related premiums due to Hurricane Katrina
    of $43 million.

This decrease was partially offset by higher net investment
    income of $10 million, primarily due to a change in the
    allocation of economic capital, offset by a lower yield on a
    slightly higher invested asset base and an increase in earned
    premium of $6 million primarily due to rate increases,
    higher inflation guard endorsements and higher

insurance-to-value

programs, all in the homeowners business.

Expenses

Total expenses decreased by $51 million, or 2%, to
    $2,825 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $2,876 million for the comparable 2004 period.

This decrease was predominantly due to improved non-catastrophe
    losses of $32 million. This was primarily due to lower
    non-catastrophe automobile and homeowner claim frequencies of
    $18 million and a smaller exposure base of $15 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable
    2004 period. Improvement in the development of losses reported
    in prior years contributed $61 million. Unallocated claim
    expenses, excluding the expenses associated with Hurricane
    Katrina, decreased by $28 million mainly due to a smaller
    increase in the year over year change in unallocated claim
    expense liability due to a smaller increase in the related loss
    reserve and related unallocated claim expense reserve rate.
    Assumed losses from the involuntary Massachusetts automobile
    plan decreased by $18 million primarily due to improved
    claim frequency and severity trends.

These improvements were partially offset by an increase in
    catastrophe losses, including Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, of
    $54 million and an increase in other expenses of
    $33 million primarily as a result of higher information
    technology, advertising and compensation costs.

The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes and before the
    reinstatement premiums and other reinsurance-related premium
    adjustments due to Hurricane Katrina, was 86.7% for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 versus 90.4% for the comparable
    2004 period.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $13 million,
    or 7%, to $200 million for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from $187 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $38 million during the
    first six months of 2006 to income from continuing operations,
    which includes $18 million, net of income tax, of net
    investment gains. Included in the Travelers results is an
    increase to policyholder benefits and claims of
    $10 million, net of income tax, resulting from the increase
    in policyholder liabilities due to higher than expected
    mortality in Brazil on specific blocks of business written in
    the Travelers entity since the acquisition, and consistent with
    the increase in the existing MetLife entity as described more
    fully below. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from
    continuing operations decreased by $25 million, or 13%,
    from the comparable 2005 period. This decrease includes the
    impact of net investment gains (losses) of ($6) million, net of
    income tax. Excluding the impact of Travelers and of net
    investment gains (losses), income from continuing operations
    decreased by $19 million from the comparable 2005 period.

Taiwan’s income from continuing operations decreased by
    $59 million, net of income tax, due to a loss recognition
    adjustment (in the form of accelerated DAC amortization) of
    $50 million, net of income tax, and restructuring costs of
    $11 million, net of income tax, partially offset by reserve
    refinements of $3 million, net of income tax, associated
    with the conversion to a new valuation system. Income from
    continuing operations decreased in Canada by $19 million,
    net of income tax, primarily due to the realignment of economic
    capital



in the prior year. Mexico’s income from continuing
    operations decreased by $12 million, net of income tax, due
    to an increase in amortization of DAC resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross margins in both years, higher operating expenses
    from the pension business, the net impact of an adjustment to
    the liability for experience refunds on a block of business, a
    decrease in various one-time other revenue items for which the
    prior year benefited by $13 million, net of income tax, and
    the current year benefited by $11 million, net of income
    tax, as well as an increase of $27 million in tax due to
    tax benefits realized in the prior year from the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”). These were partially
    offset by a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused
    by a decrease in unrealized investment gains on invested assets
    supporting those liabilities relative to the prior year, a
    decrease in policyholder benefits associated with a large group
    policy that was not renewed by the policyholder, a benefit in
    the current year from the elimination of liabilities for pending
    claims that were determined to be invalid following a review,
    the unfavorable impact in the prior year of contingent
    liabilities that were established related to potential
    employment matters in that year and which were eliminated in the
    current year as well as overall business growth. Income from
    continuing operations decreased in Brazil by $7 million,
    net of income tax, primarily due to a $10 million, net of
    income tax, increase in policyholder benefits and claims related
    to an increase in future policyholder benefit liabilities on
    specific blocks of business. This increase is due to
    significantly higher than expected mortality experience, of
    which a total of $20 million of additional liabilities were
    recorded, $10 million of which was associated with the
    acquired Travelers’ business, and $10 million of which
    was related to the existing MetLife entities. Brazil’s
    income from continuing operations was also impacted by an
    increase in litigation liabilities, as well as adverse claim
    experience in the current year. The results of the
    Company’s investment in Japan decreased by $4 million
    due to variability in the hedging program. The home office
    recorded higher infrastructure expenditures in support of
    segment growth of $39 million, net of income tax, as well
    as a $23 million contingent tax liability. In addition,
    expenses related to the Company’s

start-up

operation in Ireland reduced net income by $34 million in
    the current year. A valuation allowance was established against
    the deferred tax benefit resulting from the Ireland losses.

Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in South
    Korea’s income from continuing operations of
    $79 million, net of income tax, primarily due to continued
    growth of the in-force business, a one-time benefit of
    $38 million, net of income tax, associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system, as
    well as a benefit of $13 million from the impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates. Argentina’s income from continuing
    operations increased by $61 million, net of income tax, due
    to higher net investment income resulting from capital
    contributions since the completion of the Travelers acquisition,
    the release of liabilities for pending claims that were
    determined to be invalid following a review, the favorable
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates on
    certain contingent liabilities, the utilization of
    $4 million of net operating losses for which a valuation
    allowance had been previously established, a $12 million
    increase in the prior year period of a deferred tax valuation
    allowance established against tax benefits in that year, as well
    as business growth. Australia’s income from continuing
    operations increased by $17 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to reserve strengthening on a block of business in
    the prior year, as well as business growth. Income from
    continuing operations increased in Chile by $5 million
    primarily due to growth in the institutional business of
    $2 million, as well as the favorable impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates of $2 million, and in the United
    Kingdom by $5 million primarily due to growth of the
    in-force business. In addition, income from continuing
    operations increased by $13 million, net of income tax, due
    to a reduction in the amount charged for economic capital.

The remainder of the decrease in income from continuing
    operations can be attributed to other countries. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates accounted for $2 million of
    the increase in income from continuing operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $975 million, or 27%, to $4,604 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $3,629 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $413 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the period over period increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, such revenues increased by
    $562 million, or 15%, over the comparable 2005 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $469 million, or 17%, to $3,254 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from $2,785 million for the
    comparable 2005 period. Mexico’s premiums, fees and other



revenues increased by $159 million, primarily due to higher
    fees and growth in its universal life and institutional
    business, partially offset by an adjustment for experience
    refunds on a block of business and various one-time other
    revenue items for which the prior year benefited by
    $19 million and the current year benefited by
    $16 million. South Korea’s premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased by $156 million primarily due to
    business growth driven by strong sales of its variable universal
    life product, as well as the favorable impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates of $56 million. Premiums, fees and
    other revenues increased in Brazil by $49 million due to
    business growth and higher bancassurance business, as well as an
    increase in amounts retained under reinsurance arrangements.
    Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $22 million primarily due to the favorable impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates of $14 million, as well as
    an increase in institutional premiums through its bank
    distribution channel, partially offset by lower annuity sales
    due in part from management’s decision not to match
    aggressive pricing in the marketplace. Premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased in the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia,
    and Taiwan by $21 million, $16 million,
    $15 million, and $12 million respectively, primarily
    due to business growth. Increases in other countries accounted
    for the remainder of the change.

Net investment income increased by $93 million, or 11%, to
    $937 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $844 million for the comparable 2005 period. Net investment
    income increased in Argentina by $41 million primarily due
    to higher invested assets resulting from capital contributions
    since the completion of the Travelers acquisition. Net
    investment income in Mexico increased by $28 million
    primarily due to higher inflation rates and increases in
    invested assets, partially offset by lower average investment
    yields. Net investment income in Chile decreased by
    $8 million primarily due to a reduction in the inflation
    rate, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates of $8 million and increases in
    invested assets. The invested asset valuations and returns on
    these invested assets are linked to inflation rates in most of
    the Latin American countries in which the Company does business.
    South Korea, Brazil and Taiwan’s net investment income
    increased by $25 million, $14 million and
    $5 million, respectively, primarily due to increases in
    invested assets, as well as the favorable impact of foreign
    currency exchange rates of $10 million. Net investment
    income in the home office increased by $17 million
    primarily due to a reduction in the amount charged for economic
    capital from the prior year. These increases in net investment
    income were partially offset by a decrease of $33 million
    in Canada due to the realignment of economic capital. Increases
    in other countries accounted for the remainder of the change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable
    impact of $105 million on total revenues, excluding net
    investment gains (losses).

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $905 million, or 27%, to
    $4,316 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $3,411 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers contributed $388 million during
    the first six months of 2006 to the year over year increase.
    Excluding the impact of Travelers, total expenses increased by
    $517 million, or 15%, over the comparable 2005 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to PABs increased by $186 million, or 8%,
    to $2,597 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $2,411 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to PABs in Mexico increased by
    $113 million primarily due to an increase in other
    policyholder benefits and claims of $108 million and in
    interest credited to PABs of $39 million commensurate with
    the growth in revenue discussed above. These increases in Mexico
    were partially offset by a decrease in certain policyholder
    liabilities of $18 million caused by a decrease in the
    unrealized investment gains on the invested assets supporting
    those liabilities, a $10 million benefit from a decrease in
    policyholder benefits associated with a large group policy that
    was not renewed by the policyholder, and a $6 million
    benefit in the current year from the elimination of liabilities
    for pending claims that were determined to be invalid following
    a review. Brazil’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $49 million primarily due to an increase in
    policyholder liabilities on these specific blocks of business as
    discussed above, an increase in amounts retained under
    reinsurance arrangements, as well as adverse claim experience in
    other lines of business. South Korea’s policyholder
    benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and interest
    credited to PABs increased by $44 million commensurate with
    the business growth discussed above, as well as the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates of $33 million. These
    increases were partially offset by a decrease in policyholder
    benefits and claims, policyholder dividends, and interest
    credited to PABs in Australia of $19 million due to reserve



strengthening in the prior year on a block of reinsurance
    business and a decrease in Chile of $7 million primarily
    due to a decrease in annuity liabilities related to the decrease
    in the inflation index and the decrease in annuity premiums
    discussed above, partially offset by growth in the institutional
    business, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates of $17 million. Policyholder benefits and claims,
    policyholder dividends, and interest credited to PABs decreased
    in Taiwan by $2 million primarily due to a decrease of
    $14 million from reserve refinements associated with the
    implementation of a new valuation system, partially offset by an
    increase of $12 million primarily due to business growth.
    Argentina’s policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder
    dividends, and interest credited to PABs decreased by
    $2 million primarily due to the elimination of liabilities
    for pending claims that were determined to be invalid following
    a review, partially offset by business growth. Increases in
    other countries accounted for the remainder of the change.

Other expenses increased by $330 million, or 33%, to
    $1,330 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $1,000 million for the comparable 2005 period.
    Taiwan’s other expenses increased by $110 million
    primarily due to a one-time increase in DAC amortization of
    $77 million due to a loss recognition adjustment resulting
    from low interest rates relative to product guarantees coupled
    with high persistency rates on certain blocks of business, an
    increase of $17 million related to the termination of the
    agency distribution channel in Taiwan, an increase of
    $9 million from refinements associated with the
    implementation of a new valuation system, as well as business
    growth. Mexico’s other expenses increased by
    $49 million primarily due to an increase in commissions
    commensurate with the revenue growth discussed above, higher DAC
    amortization resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both
    the current and prior years, higher expenses related to growth
    initiatives, and additional expenses associated with the Mexican
    pension business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of
    contingent liabilities that were established in the prior year
    related to potential employment matters and which were
    eliminated in the current year. South Korea’s other
    expenses increased by $25 million, primarily due to an
    increase in DAC amortization and general expenses, which were
    both due to the growth in business, the impact in the prior year
    of an accrual for an early retirement program and the impact of
    foreign currency exchange rates of $15 million. These were
    partially offset by a decrease of $60 million in DAC
    amortization associated with the implementation of a more
    refined reserve valuation system. Brazil’s other expenses
    increased by $25 million primarily due to the growth in
    business discussed above, as well as an increase in litigation
    liabilities. Chile’s other expenses increased by
    $13 million due to increased commissions and other expenses
    associated with its institutional business, as well as the
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates of $4 million.
    Other expenses increased in the United Kingdom and Australia by
    $15 million and $8 million, respectively, primarily
    due to business growth. Other expenses associated with the home
    office increased by $57 million primarily due to an
    increase in expenditures for information technology projects,
    growth initiative projects and integration costs, as well as an
    increase in compensation resulting from an increase in headcount
    from the comparable 2005 period. In addition, $34 million
    of expenses were incurred related to the

start-up

of
    the Company’s operation in Ireland. These increases were
    partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of
    $9 million in Argentina primarily due to the favorable
    impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation rates on
    certain contingent liabilities. Increases in other countries
    accounted for the remainder of the change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for
    $90 million of the increase in total expenses.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — International

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased by $15 million,
    or 7%, to $187 million for the year ended December 31,
    2005 from $202 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for a loss from continuing
    operations of $24 million including net investment losses
    of $14 million, net of income tax. Excluding the impact of
    the Travelers acquisition, income from continuing operations
    increased by $9 million, or 4%, over the prior year.

South Korea’s income from continuing operations increased
    by $26 million, net of income tax, primarily due to growth
    in business, specifically higher sales of its variable universal
    life product and a larger in-force business. Chile’s income
    from continuing operations increased by $8 million
    primarily due to growth in business, specifically in the new
    bank distribution channel, as well as an increase in net
    investment income primarily due to higher



inflation rates. Mexico’s income from continuing operations
    increased by $8 million, primarily due to tax benefits of
    $27 million under the AJCA, higher net investment earnings,
    an adjustment to the amortization of DAC for management’s
    update of assumptions used to determine estimated gross margins
    and several other one-time revenue items. These increases in
    Mexico were substantially offset by an increase in certain
    policyholder liabilities caused by unrealized investment losses
    on the invested assets supporting those liabilities, as well as
    an increase in expenses for start up costs for the new Mexican
    Pension Business (“AFORE”) and contingency liabilities.

Partially offsetting these increases in income from continuing
    operations was a decrease in Canada of $13 million, net of
    income tax, primarily due to a realignment of economic capital,
    offset by the strengthening of the liability on its pension
    business related to changes in mortality assumptions in the
    prior year and higher home office and infrastructure
    expenditures in support of the segment growth of
    $16 million, net of income tax. The remainder of the
    variance can be attributed to various other countries.

Additionally, $4 million of the increase in income from
    continuing operations is due to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $982 million, or 37%, to $3,629 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $2,647 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $377 million of this
    increase. Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition,
    total revenues, excluding net investment gains, increased by
    $605 million, or 23%, over the comparable 2004 period.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $452 million, or 22%, to $2,514 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from $2,062 million for the
    comparable 2004 period. This increase is primarily the result of
    continued business growth through increased sales and renewal
    business within South Korea, Brazil and Taiwan of
    $216 million, $48 million and $31 million,
    respectively. Mexico’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    increased by $78 million primarily due to increases in the
    institutional and agency business channels, as well as several
    one-time other revenue items of $19 million. Chile’s
    premiums, fees and other revenues increased by $64 million
    mainly due to its new bank distribution channel.

Net investment income increased by $153 million, or 26%, to
    $738 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $585 million for the comparable 2004 period. Mexico’s
    net investment income increased by $89 million due
    principally to increases in interest rates and also as a result
    of an increase in invested assets. Chile’s net investment
    income increased by $58 million primarily due to higher
    inflation rates and an increase in invested assets. Investment
    valuations and returns on invested assets in Chile are linked to
    the inflation rates. South Korea and Taiwan’s net
    investment income increased by $20 million and
    $11 million, respectively, primarily due to an increase in
    their invested assets. These increases in net investment income
    were partially offset by a decrease of $21 million due to
    the realignment of economic capital. The remainder of the
    increases in total revenues, excluding net investment gains, can
    be attributed to business growth and investment income in other
    countries.

Additionally, $221 million of the increase in total
    revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses), is due to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,029 million, or 43%, to
    $3,411 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $2,382 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers accounted for $404 million of this
    increase. Excluding the impact of the Travelers acquisition,
    total expenses increased by $625 million, or 26%, over the
    comparable 2004 period. Policyholder benefits and claims,
    policyholder dividends and interest credited to PABs increased
    by $451 million, or 26%, to $2,219 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2005 from $1,768 million for
    the comparable 2004 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims and dividends in Mexico
    increased by $177 million primarily due to an increase in
    certain policyholder liabilities caused by unrealized investment
    gains (losses) on the invested assets supporting those
    liabilities of $110 million, as well as an increase in
    interest credited to policyholder accounts of $65 million
    in line with the net investment income increase in Mexico. South
    Korea, Taiwan and Brazil’s



policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder accounts increased by
    $122 million, $41 million and $27 million,
    respectively, commensurate with the business growth discussed
    above. Chile’s policyholder benefits and claims,
    policyholder dividends and interest credited to policyholder
    accounts increased by $86 million due to the business
    growth primarily in the bank distribution channel business, as
    well as to an increase in the liabilities for annuity benefits,
    which, like net investment income on related assets, are linked
    to the inflation rate. Hong Kong’s policyholder benefits
    and claims and policyholder dividends increased by
    $3 million due to higher claims and the associated increase
    in liabilities in 2005. These increases were partially offset by
    a decrease of $10 million in Canada’s policyholder
    benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and interest
    credited to PABs primarily due to the strengthening of the
    liability on its pension business related to changes in
    mortality assumptions in the prior year.

Other expenses increased by $174 million, or 28%, to
    $788 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $614 million for the comparable 2004 period. South
    Korea’s other expenses increased by $73 million
    primarily due to higher amortization of DAC driven by the rapid
    growth in the business, a decrease in a payroll tax liability in
    the prior year resulting from the resolution of the related tax
    matter, an accrual for an early retirement program in 2005, as
    well as additional overhead expenses in line with the growth in
    business. Mexico’s other expenses increased by
    $17 million primarily due to incurred start up costs during
    the current year associated with the AFORE operations, an
    increase in liabilities related to potential employment matters
    in 2005, an increase in consulting services and a decrease in
    the prior year of severance accruals. Partially offsetting these
    increases in Mexico is a decrease in the amortization of DAC due
    to an adjustment for management’s update of assumptions
    used to determine estimated gross margins. Brazil’s other
    expenses increased by $28 million, primarily due to growth
    in business discussed above including an increase in
    non-deferrable sales expenses. Chile’s other expenses
    increased by $24 million due primarily to increases in
    non-deferrable expenses for the bank distribution channel of
    business in 2005. Other expenses at home office also increased
    by $26 million primarily due to increased consultant fees
    for growth initiative projects, an increase in compensation
    resulting from increased headcount, higher incentive
    compensation, as well as higher costs for legal, marketing and
    other corporate support expenses. The remainder of the increase
    in total expenses can be attributed to business growth in other
    countries.

Additionally, a component of the growth in total expenses is due
    to changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
    $202 million.

Year
    ended December 31, 2006 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2005 — Reinsurance

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $26 million, or 28%, to
    $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $92 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in net income was attributable to a 12% increase in
    premiums while policyholder benefits and claims increased by 9%,
    a 21% increase in net investment income while interest credited
    to PABs increased by 15%, and a 14% increase in other revenues.
    The increase in premiums, net of the increase in policyholder
    benefits and claims, added $127 million to net income which
    was primarily due to added business in-force from facultative
    and automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks
    of business in the U.S. and international operations. The
    increase in policyholder benefits and claims was partially
    offset by unfavorable mortality and an increase in the
    liabilities associated with RGA’s Argentine pension
    business, both in the prior-year period. The increase in net
    investment income and interest credited to PABs added
    $60 million to net income and was due to growth in the
    invested asset base. The increase in invested assets, and net
    investment income, substantially derived from the issuance of
    notes and a collateral financing facility, which increased
    interest expense within other expenses as described below. The
    increase in other revenues added $5 million to net income
    and was primarily related to an increase in investment product
    fees on asset-intensive business and financial reinsurance fees
    during 2006, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency
    transaction gains in the prior-year period.

These increases in net income were partially offset by a
    $153 million increase in other expenses and a
    $10 million decrease in net investment gains (losses), all
    net of income tax. Additionally, a higher effective tax rate in
    2006 reduced net income by $3 million. The increase in
    other expenses was primarily related to expenses associated with
    DAC, including reinsurance allowances paid, interest expense
    associated with RGA’s issuance of $850 million

30-year

notes to provide long-term collateral for Regulation XXX
    statutory reserves in June 2006 and $400 million of junior
    subordinated notes in December 2005, minority interest expense,
    and equity compensation expense.



Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $613 million, or 14%, to $5,146 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $4,533 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in such revenues was primarily associated with
    growth in premiums of $479 million from new facultative and
    automatic treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of
    business in all RGA operating segments, including the U.S.,
    which contributed $220 million; Asia Pacific, which
    contributed $138 million; Canada, which contributed
    $86 million; and Europe and South Africa, which contributed
    $35 million. Premium levels were significantly influenced
    by large transactions and reporting practices of ceding
    companies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period.

Net investment income increased by $126 million, primarily
    due to growth in the invested asset base from net proceeds of
    RGA’s $850 million

30-year

notes offering in June 2006 and $400 million junior
    subordinated note offering in December 2005, positive operating
    cash inflows and additional deposits associated with the
    coinsurance of annuity products. Investment yields were up
    slightly compared to the prior-year period. The increase in net
    investment income was partially offset by a decrease related to
    a realignment of economic capital.

Other revenues increased by $8 million primarily due to an
    increase in investment product fees on asset-intensive business
    and financial reinsurance fees during 2006, partially offset by
    a decrease in foreign currency transaction gains.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total revenues,
    excluding net investment gains (losses), was a $36 million
    increase associated with foreign currency exchange rate
    movements.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $554 million, or 13%, to
    $4,971 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $4,417 million for the comparable 2005 period.

The increase in total expenses was commensurate with the growth
    in revenues and was primarily attributable to an increase of
    $284 million in policyholder benefits and claims, primarily
    associated with growth in insurance in-force of
    $245 billion, and a $34 million increase in interest
    credited due to growth in PABs associated with the coinsurance
    of annuity products, which is generally offset by a
    corresponding increase in net investment income. The increase in
    policyholder benefits and claims of $284 million was
    partially offset by favorable underwriting results in RGA’s
    international operations in the current year period, unfavorable
    mortality experience in the U.S. and the United Kingdom in the
    prior-year period, and a $33 million increase in the
    liabilities associated with the Argentine pension business in
    the prior year period.

Other expenses increased by $236 million due to a
    $92 million increase in expenses associated with DAC,
    including reinsurance allowances paid, a $47 million
    increase in interest expense primarily associated with
    RGA’s issuance of $850 million

30-year

notes in June 2006 and $400 million of junior subordinated
    notes in December 2005, as well as a $47 million increase
    in minority interest expense on the larger earnings base in the
    current period. The remaining increase of $50 million was
    primarily related to overhead-related expenses associated with
    RGA’s international expansion and general growth in
    operations, including equity compensation expense.

Additionally, a component of the increase in total expenses was
    a $33 million increase associated with foreign currency
    exchange rate movements.

Year
    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — Reinsurance

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $1 million, or 1%, to
    $92 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $91 million for the comparable 2004 period.

This increase was attributable to a 14% increase in revenues,
    primarily due to new premiums from facultative and automatic
    treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business in
    the U.S. and international operations, as well as an increase in
    net investment income due to growth in RGA’s operations and
    invested asset base.



The increase in net income was partially offset by a reduction
    in net investment gains of $12 million, net of income tax
    and minority interest, and a higher loss ratio in the 2005
    period, primarily due to unfavorable mortality experience as a
    result of high claim levels in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.
    during the first six months of the year. Reserve strengthening
    in RGA’s Argentine pension business in 2005 reduced net
    income by $11 million, net of income tax and minority
    interest. The comparable 2004 period included a negotiated claim
    settlement in RGA’s accident and health business, reducing
    net income by $8 million, net of income tax and minority
    interest. The Argentine pension business and the accident and
    health business are in run-off.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $591 million, or 15%, to $4,533 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $3,942 million for the comparable 2004 period primarily due
    to a $521 million, or 16%, increase in premiums and a
    $68 million, or 13%, increase in net investment income.

New premiums from facultative and automatic treaties and renewal
    premiums on existing blocks of business in the U.S. and
    international operations contributed to the premium growth.
    Premium levels were significantly influenced by large
    transactions and reporting practices of ceding companies and, as
    a result, can fluctuate from period to period.

The growth in net investment income was the result of the growth
    in RGA’s operations and invested asset base.

Additionally, a component of the total revenue increase was
    attributable to foreign currency exchange rate movements
    contributing an estimated $49 million.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $553 million, or 14%, to
    $4,417 million for the year ended December 31, 2005
    from $3,864 million for the comparable 2004 period.

This increase was commensurate with growth in revenues and was
    primarily attributable to an increase of $520 million in
    policyholder benefits and claims and interest credited to PABs,
    primarily associated with RGA’s growth in insurance in
    force of $270 billion, the aforementioned unfavorable
    mortality experience in the U.S. and the United Kingdom during
    the first six months of the 2005 period, and strengthening of
    reserves of $33 million for the Argentine pension business.
    The comparable 2004 period included a negotiated claim
    settlement in RGA’s accident and health business of
    $24 million and $18 million in policy benefits and
    claims as a result of the Indian Ocean tsunami on
    December 26, 2004 and claims development associated with
    the reinsurance of the Argentine pension business, respectively.

Other expenses increased by $34 million, or 4%, primarily
    due to an increase in the amortization of DAC. Changes in DAC,
    included in other expenses, can vary from period to period
    primarily due to changes in the mixture of the business being
    reinsured.

Additionally, $46 million of the total expense increase was
    attributable to foreign currency exchange rate movements.

Income
    (Loss) from Continuing Operations

Income (loss) from continuing operations increased by
    $14 million, or 93%, to ($1) million for the year
    ended December 31, 2006 from ($15) million for the
    comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers, excluding
    Travelers financing and integration costs incurred by the
    Company, contributed $111 million during the first six
    months of 2006 to income (loss) from continuing operations,
    which included $3 million, net of income tax, of net
    investment losses. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income
    (loss) from continuing operations decreased by $97 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from the comparable
    2005 period. Included in this decrease were higher investment
    losses of $66 million, net of income tax. Excluding the
    impact of Travelers and the increase of net investment losses,
    income (loss) from continuing operations decreased by
    $31 million.

The 2006 period includes an expense related to a
    $23 million, net of income tax, contribution to the MetLife
    Foundation. The 2005 period included a $30 million benefit
    associated with the reduction of a previously established
    liability for settlement death benefits related to the
    Company’s sales practices class action settlement recorded
    in 1999, and an $18 million benefit, associated with the
    reduction of a previously established real estate transfer tax
    liability related to Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in
    2000, both net of income tax. Excluding the impact of these
    items, income from continuing operations increased by
    $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    the comparable 2005 period. The increase in income (loss) from
    continuing operations was primarily attributable to higher net
    investment income, lower integration costs and higher other
    revenues of $102 million,



$62 million, and $4 million, respectively, all of
    which were net of income tax. This was partially offset by
    higher interest expense on debt (principally associated with the
    issuance of debt to finance the Travelers acquisition),
    corporate support expenses, interest credited to bankholder
    deposits and legal-related liabilities of $125 million,
    $70 million, $55 million and $5 million,
    respectively, all of which were net of income tax. Tax benefits
    increased by $113 million over the comparable 2005 period
    due to the difference of finalizing the Company’s 2005 tax
    return in 2006 when compared to finalizing the Company’s
    2004 tax return in 2005 and the difference between the actual
    and the estimated tax rate allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $361 million, or 47%, to $1,123 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $762 million
    for the comparable 2005 period. The acquisition of Travelers
    contributed $200 million during the first six months of
    2006 to the period over period increase. Excluding the impact of
    Travelers, revenues increased by $161 million, or 21%, from
    the comparable 2005 period. This increase was primarily
    attributable to increased net investment income of
    $157 million primarily from increases in income on fixed
    maturity securities due to improved yields from lengthening of
    the duration and a higher asset base, and the impact of higher
    short-term interest rates on cash equivalents and short term
    investments. The increase also resulted from a higher asset base
    invested in mortgage loans on real estate, real estate joint
    ventures, and other limited partnership interests and was
    partially offset by a decline in securities lending results and
    leveraged leases. The remainder of the increase was primarily
    attributable to increased other revenues of $4 million,
    which primarily consisted of increased surrender values on
    corporate owned life insurance policies. Also included as a
    component of total revenues were the intersegment eliminations
    which were offset within total expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $446 million, or 47%, to
    $1,386 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    from $940 million for the comparable 2005 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers, excluding Travelers financing and
    integration costs, contributed $59 million during the first
    six months of 2006 to the period over period increase. Excluding
    the impact of Travelers, total expenses increased by
    $387 million, or 41%, for the year ended December 31,
    2006 from the comparable 2005 period.

The 2006 period included a $35 million contribution to the
    MetLife Foundation. The 2005 period included a $47 million
    benefit associated with a reduction of a previously established
    liability for settlement death benefits related to the
    Company’s sales practices class action settlement recorded
    in 1999 and a $28 million benefit associated with the
    reduction of a previously established real estate transfer tax
    liability related to Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in
    2000. Excluding the impact of these items, total expenses
    increased by $277 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from the comparable 2005 period. This
    increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense
    of $192 million. The principal reason was a result of the
    issuance of senior notes in 2005, which included
    $119 million of expenses from the financing of the
    acquisition of Travelers. Additionally, as a result of the
    issuance of commercial paper, short-term interest expense
    increased by $67 million. Corporate support expenses, which
    included advertising,

start-up

costs for new products and information technology costs, were
    higher by $107 million, partially offset by lower
    integration costs of $95 million. As a result of growth in
    the business and higher interest rates, interest credited to
    bankholder deposits increased by $85 million at MetLife
    Bank. Legal-related costs were higher by $8 million,
    predominantly from the reduction of previously established
    liabilities related to legal disputes during the 2005 period.
    Also included as a component of total expenses were the
    elimination of intersegment amounts which were offset within
    total revenues.

    ended December 31, 2005 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2004 — Corporate &
    Other

Income
    (Loss) from Continuing Operations

Income (loss) from continuing operations increased by
    $67 million, or 82%, to ($15) million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from ($82) million for the
    comparable 2004 period. The acquisition of Travelers, excluding
    Travelers financing and integration costs incurred by the
    Company, contributed $88 million of this increase which
    included $1 million, net of income tax, of net investment
    losses. Excluding the impact of Travelers, income from



continuing operations decreased by $21 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from the comparable 2004 period.
    Included in this decrease were lower investment losses of
    $69 million, net of income tax. Excluding the impact of
    Travelers and the decrease of net investment losses, income
    (loss) from continuing operations decreased by $90 million.

The 2005 period includes a $30 million benefit, net of
    income tax, associated with the reduction of a previously
    established liability for settlement death benefits related to
    the Company’s sales practices class action settlement
    recorded in 1999, and an $18 million benefit, net of income
    tax, associated with the reduction of a previously established
    real estate transfer tax liability related to Metropolitan
    Life’s demutualization in 2000. The 2004 period includes a
    $105 million benefit associated with the resolution of
    issues relating to the Internal Revenue Service’s audit of
    Metropolitan Life and its subsidiaries’ tax returns for the
    years

1997-1999.

Also included in the 2004 period was an expense related to a
    $32 million, net of income tax, contribution to the MetLife
    Foundation. Excluding the impact of these items, income from
    continuing operations decreased by $65 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2005 from the comparable 2004 period.
    The decrease was primarily attributable to higher interest
    expense on debt (principally associated with the issuance of
    debt to finance the Travelers acquisition), integration costs
    associated with the acquisition of Travelers, interest credited
    to bank holder deposits and legal-related liabilities of
    $119 million, $76 million, $44 million and
    $4 million, respectively, all of which were net of income
    tax. This was partially offset by an increase in net investment
    income of $107 million, and a decrease in corporate support
    expenses of $10 million, both of which were net of income
    tax. Tax benefits increased by $61 million over the
    comparable 2004 period due to the difference of finalizing the
    Company’s 2004 tax return in 2005 when compared to
    finalizing the Company’s 2003 tax return in 2004 and the
    difference between the actual and the estimated tax rate
    allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $376 million, or 97%, to $762 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2005 from $386 million for
    the comparable 2004 period. The acquisition of Travelers
    contributed $152 million to the period over period
    increase. Excluding the impact of Travelers, the increase of
    $224 million was primarily attributable to increases in
    income on fixed maturity securities due to improved yields from
    lengthening of the duration and a higher asset base, as well as
    increased income from other limited partnerships and mortgage
    loans on real estate. Also included as a component of total
    revenues were the intersegment eliminations which were offset
    within total expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $330 million, or 54%, to
    $940 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    $610 million for the comparable 2004 period. The
    acquisition of Travelers, excluding Travelers financing and
    integration costs, contributed $15 million to the period
    over period increase. Excluding the impact of Travelers, total
    expenses increased by $315 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2005 from the comparable 2004 period.

The 2005 period includes a $47 million benefit associated
    with a reduction of a previously established liability for
    settlement death benefits related to the Company’s sales
    practices class action settlement recorded in 1999, a
    $28 million benefit associated with the reduction of a
    previously established real estate transfer tax liability
    related to Metropolitan Life’s demutualization in 2000. The
    2004 period includes a $50 million contribution to the
    MetLife Foundation, partially offset by a $22 million
    reduction of a liability associated with the resolution of all
    issues relating to the Internal Revenue Service’s audit of
    Metropolitan Life and its subsidiaries’ tax returns for the
    years

1997-1999.

Excluding the impact of these items, total expenses increased by
    $418 million for the year ended December 31, 2005 from
    the comparable 2004 period. This increase was attributable to
    higher interest expense of $187 million as a result of the
    issuance of senior notes in 2004 and 2005, which included
    $129 million of expenses from the financing of the
    acquisition of Travelers. Integration costs associated with the
    acquisition of Travelers were $120 million. As a result of
    growth in the business, interest credited to bank holder
    deposits increased by $70 million at MetLife Bank. In
    addition, legal-related liabilities increased by
    $5 million. These increases were offset by a reduction in
    corporate support expenses of $16 million. Also included as
    a component of total expenses was the elimination of
    intersegment amounts which was offset within total revenues.



Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

The
    Company

Capital

RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the
    National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) and the state insurance departments to
    identify companies that merit further regulatory action on an
    annual basis. RBC is based on a formula calculated by applying
    factors to various asset, premium and statutory reserve items.
    The formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the
    insurer, including asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate
    risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis. The
    formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify
    possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of
    initiating regulatory action, and not as a means to rank
    insurers generally. These rules apply to each of the Holding
    Company’s domestic insurance subsidiaries. As of the date
    of the most recent statutory financial statements filed with
    insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of
    these subsidiaries was in excess of the most recently referenced
    RBC-based amount calculated at December 31, 2006.

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001 to standardize
    regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance
    departments. However, statutory accounting principles continue
    to be established by individual state laws and permitted
    practices. The New York State Department of Insurance (the
    “Department”) has adopted Codification with certain
    modifications for the preparation of statutory financial
    statements of insurance companies domiciled in New York.
    Modifications by the various state insurance departments may
    impact the effect of Codification on the statutory capital and
    surplus of the Holding Company’s domestic insurance
    subsidiaries.

Asset/Liability
    Management

The Company actively manages its assets using an approach that
    balances quality, diversification, asset/liability matching,
    liquidity and investment return. The goals of the investment
    process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring
    that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and
    duration basis. The asset/liability management process is the
    shared responsibility of the Portfolio Management Unit, the
    Financial Management and Oversight Asset/Liability Management
    Unit, and the operating business segments under the supervision
    of the various product line specific Asset/Liability Management
    Committees (“ALM Committees”). The ALM
    Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving target
    portfolios on a periodic basis, establishing investment
    guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the
    asset/liability management process. The portfolio managers and
    asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a

day-to-day

basis for risk management of their respective investing
    activities, implement the goals and objectives established by
    the ALM Committees.

The Company establishes target asset portfolios for each major
    insurance product, which represent the investment strategies
    used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels
    of risk. These strategies are monitored through regular review
    of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve
    sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration
    and credit quality. In executing these asset/liability matching
    strategies, management regularly reevaluates the estimates used
    in determining the approximate amounts and timing of payments to
    or on behalf of policyholders for insurance liabilities. Many of
    these estimates are inherently subjective and could impact the
    Company’s ability to achieve its asset/liability management
    goals and objectives.

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate
    adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. The Company’s
    liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments, excluding securities lending) was $7.7 billion
    and $6.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Liquidity needs are determined from a rolling

12-month

forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily. Asset mix and
    maturities are adjusted based on forecast. Cash flow testing and
    stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity. The
    Company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its
    cash needs under various scenarios that include the potential
    risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The
    Company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many



of its products, including general account institutional pension
    products (generally group annuities, including GICs, and certain
    deposit funds liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan
    sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from
    making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product.

In the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements
    beyond normal liquidity, the Company has multiple alternatives
    available based on market conditions and the amount and timing
    of the liquidity need. These options include cash flows from
    operations, the sale of liquid assets, global funding sources
    and various credit facilities.

The Company’s ability to sell investment assets could be
    limited by accounting rules including rules relating to the
    intent and ability to hold impaired securities until the market
    value of those securities recovers.

In extreme circumstances, all general account assets within a
    statutory legal entity are available to fund any obligation of
    the general account within that legal entity.

Liquidity
    Sources

Cash Flows from Operations.

The Company’s
    principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from
    insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A
    primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is
    the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.

The Company’s principal cash inflows from its investment
    activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from
    maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income.
    The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash
    inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market
    volatilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these
    risks through its credit risk management process.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments, and marketable fixed maturity and equity
    securities. Liquid assets exclude assets relating to securities
    lending and dollar roll activities. At December 31, 2006
    and 2005, the Company had $186.5 billion and
    $179.0 billion in liquid assets, respectively.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of both short-term and long-term
    instruments, including repurchase agreements, commercial paper,
    medium-term and long-term debt, capital securities and
    stockholders’ equity. The diversity of the Company’s
    funding sources enhances funding flexibility, limits dependence
    on any one source of funds and generally lowers the cost of
    funds.

At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    outstanding $1.4 billion in short-term debt and at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, had outstanding
    $10.0 billion and $9.5 billion in long-term debt,
    respectively.

Debt Issuances.

On December 21, 2006, the
    Holding Company issued junior subordinated debentures with a
    face amount of $1.25 billion. The debentures are scheduled
    for redemption on December 15, 2036; the final maturity of
    the debentures is December 15, 2066. The Holding Company
    may redeem the debentures (i) in whole or in part, at any
    time on or after December 15, 2031 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to December 15, 2031 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.40% up to, but not
    including, the scheduled redemption date. In the event the
    debentures are not redeemed on or before the scheduled
    redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual rate of
    three-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable
    quarterly in arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and
    in certain circumstances the requirement to, defer interest
    payments on the debentures for a period up to ten years.
    Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. In
    connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Holding
    Company entered into a replacement capital covenant
    (“RCC”). As a part of the RCC, the Holding Company
    agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the
    debentures on or before December 15, 2056, unless, subject
    to certain limitations, it has received proceeds from the sale
    of specified capital securities. The RCC will terminate upon the
    occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the
    debentures due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC
    is not intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and
    may not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of
    holders of one or more other designated series of its
    indebtedness (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035).



On June 28, 2006, Timberlake Financial L.L.C.
    (“Timberlake”), a subsidiary of RGA, completed an
    offering of $850 million of Series A Floating Rate
    Insured Notes due June 2036, which is included in the
    Company’s long-term debt. Interest on the notes will accrue
    at an annual rate of

1-month

LIBOR plus a base margin, payable monthly. The notes represent
    senior, secured indebtedness of Timberlake with no recourse to
    RGA or its other subsidiaries. Up to $150 million of
    additional notes may be offered in the future. The proceeds of
    the offering provide long-term collateral to support
    Regulation XXX statutory reserves on 1.5 million term
    life insurance policies with guaranteed level premium periods
    reinsured by RGA Reinsurance Company, a U.S. subsidiary of
    RGA.

MetLife Bank has entered into several funding agreements with
    the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLB of
    NY”) whereby MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements
    in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been
    granted a blanket lien on MetLife Bank’s residential
    mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to collateralize
    MetLife Bank’s obligations under the repurchase agreements.
    The repurchase agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is
    limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the
    outstanding repurchase agreements. The amount of the
    Company’s liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB
    of NY was $998 million and $855 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt.

On December 8, 2005, RGA issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $400 million. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.75% up to but not
    including the scheduled redemption date. The securities may be
    redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    December 15, 2015 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in
    whole or in part, prior to December 15, 2015 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. In the event the
    junior subordinated debentures are not redeemed on or before the
    scheduled redemption date of December 15, 2015, interest on
    these junior subordinated debentures will accrue at an annual
    rate of three-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.665%, payable
    quarterly in arrears. The final maturity of the debentures is
    December 15, 2065. RGA has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during periods of deferral.

On June 29, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    400 million pounds sterling ($729.2 million at
    issuance) aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes
    due June 29, 2020 at a discount of 4.5 million pounds
    sterling ($8.1 million at issuance), for aggregate proceeds
    of 395.5 million pounds sterling ($721.1 million at
    issuance). The senior notes were initially offered and sold
    outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

On June 23, 2005, the Holding Company issued in the United
    States public market $1,000 million aggregate principal
    amount of 5.00% senior notes due June 15, 2015 at a
    discount of $2.7 million ($997.3 million), and
    $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035 at a discount of
    $2.4 million ($997.6 million).

MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife Funding”), a
    subsidiary of Metropolitan Life, serves as a centralized finance
    unit for the Company. Pursuant to a support agreement,
    Metropolitan Life has agreed to cause MetLife Funding to have a
    tangible net worth of at least one dollar. At both
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, MetLife Funding had a tangible
    net worth of $11 million. MetLife Funding raises cash from
    various funding sources and uses the proceeds to extend loans,
    through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of Metropolitan
    Life, to the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life and other
    affiliates. MetLife Funding manages its funding sources to
    enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of Metropolitan
    Life and other affiliated companies. At December 31, 2006
    and 2005, MetLife Funding had total outstanding liabilities,
    including accrued interest payable, of $840 million and
    $456 million, respectively, consisting primarily of
    commercial paper.

Credit Facilities.

The Company maintains
    committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating
    $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2006. When drawn upon,
    these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance
    with the respective agreements. The facilities can be used for
    general corporate purposes and at December 31, 2006,

Other policyholder liabilities is comprised of other
    policyholder funds, policyholder dividends payable and the
    policyholder dividend obligation. Amounts included in the table
    above related to these liabilities are as follows:



Separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above.
    Separate account liabilities represent the fair market value of
    the funds that are separately administered by the Company.
    Generally, the separate account owner, rather than the Company,
    bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account
    liabilities are legally segregated and are not subject to the
    claims that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are not
    reflected in the consolidated statements of income. The separate
    account liabilities will be fully funded by cash flows from the
    separate account assets.

The Company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and
    services in the normal course of business; however, these
    purchase obligations are not material to its consolidated
    results of operations or financial position as of
    December 31, 2006.

Additionally, the Company has agreements in place for services
    it conducts, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to
    insurance, reinsurance, loans, and capitalization. All material
    intercompany transactions



have appropriately been eliminated in consolidation.
    Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and
    affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of
    insurance as required.

Support Agreements.

Metropolitan Life entered
    into a net worth maintenance agreement with New England Life
    Insurance Company (“NELICO”) at the time Metropolitan
    Life merged with New England Mutual Life Insurance Company.
    Under the agreement, Metropolitan Life agreed, without
    limitation as to the amount, to cause NELICO to have a minimum
    capital and surplus of $10 million, total adjusted capital
    at a level not less than the company action level RBC (or
    not less than 125% of the company action level RBC, if
    NELICO has a negative trend), as defined by state insurance
    statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its
    current obligations on a timely basis. As of the date of the
    most recent statutory financial statements filed with insurance
    regulators, the capital and surplus of NELICO was in excess of
    the minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its
    total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent
    referenced RBC-based amount calculated at December 31, 2006.

In connection with the Company’s acquisition of the parent
    of General American Life Insurance Company (“General
    American”), Metropolitan Life entered into a net worth
    maintenance agreement with General American. Under the
    agreement, as subsequently amended, Metropolitan Life agreed,
    without limitation as to amount, to cause General American to
    have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million, total
    adjusted capital at a level not less than 250% of the company
    action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes,
    and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current
    obligations on a timely basis. As of the date of the most recent
    statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators,
    the capital and surplus of General American was in excess of the
    minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its
    total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent
    referenced RBC-based amount calculated at December 31, 2006.

Metropolitan Life has also entered into arrangements for the
    benefit of some of its other subsidiaries and affiliates to
    assist such subsidiaries and affiliates in meeting various
    jurisdictions’ regulatory requirements regarding capital
    and surplus and security deposits. In addition, Metropolitan
    Life has entered into a support arrangement with respect to a
    subsidiary under which Metropolitan Life may become responsible,
    in the event that the subsidiary becomes the subject of
    insolvency proceedings, for the payment of certain reinsurance
    recoverables due from the subsidiary to one or more of its
    cedents in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
    applicable reinsurance agreements.

General American has agreed to guarantee certain contractual
    obligations of its former subsidiaries, Paragon Life Insurance
    Company (which merged into Metropolitan Life in 2006), MetLife
    Investors Insurance Company (“MetLife Investors”),
    First MetLife Investors Insurance Company and MetLife Investors
    Insurance Company of California (which merged into MetLife
    Investors in 2006). In addition, General American has entered
    into a contingent reinsurance agreement with MetLife Investors.
    Under this agreement, in the event that MetLife Investors’
    statutory capital and surplus is less than $10 million or
    total adjusted capital falls below 180% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes, General
    American would assume as assumption reinsurance, subject to
    regulatory approvals and required consents, all of MetLife
    Investors’ life insurance policies and annuity contract
    liabilities. As of the date of the most recent statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the
    capital and surplus of MetLife Investors was in excess of the
    minimum capital and surplus amount referenced above, and its
    total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent
    referenced RBC-based amount calculated at December 31, 2006.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors and First
    MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under these agreements, as
    subsequently amended, the Holding Company agreed, without
    limitation as to the amount, to cause each of these subsidiaries
    to have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million, total
    adjusted capital at a level not less than 150% of the company
    action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes,
    and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current
    obligations on a timely basis. As of the date of the most recent
    statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators,
    the capital and surplus of each of these subsidiaries was in
    excess of the minimum capital and surplus amounts referenced
    above, and their total adjusted capital was in excess of the
    most recent referenced RBC-based amount calculated at
    December 31, 2006.



The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns approximately 50% of the equity. Under the
    agreement, the Holding Company agreed, without limitation as to
    amount, to cause MSMIC to have the amount of capital and surplus
    necessary for MSMIC to maintain a solvency ratio of at least
    400%, as calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business
    Law of Japan, and to make such loans to MSMIC as may be
    necessary to ensure that MSMIC has sufficient cash or other
    liquid assets to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
    As of the date of the most recent calculation, the capital and
    surplus of MSMIC was in excess of the minimum capital and
    surplus amount referenced above.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers, MetLife
    International Holdings, Inc. (“MIH”), a subsidiary of
    the Holding Company, committed to the Australian Prudential
    Regulatory Authority that it will provide or procure the
    provision of additional capital to MetLife General Insurance
    Limited (“MGIL”), an Australian subsidiary of MIH, to
    the extent necessary to enable MGIL to meet insurance capital
    adequacy and solvency requirements. In addition, MetLife
    International Insurance, Ltd. (“MIIL”), a Bermuda
    insurance company, was acquired as part of the Travelers
    transaction. In connection with the assumption of a block of
    business by MIIL from a company in liquidation in 1995, Citicorp
    Life Insurance Company (“CLIC”), an affiliate of MIIL
    and a subsidiary of the Holding Company, agreed with MIIL and
    the liquidator to make capital contributions to MIIL to ensure
    that, for so long as any policies in such block remain
    outstanding, MIIL remains solvent and able to honor the
    liabilities under such policies. As a result of the merger of
    CLIC into Metropolitan Life that occurred in October 2006, this
    became an obligation of Metropolitan Life. In connection with
    the acquisition of Travelers, the Holding Company also committed
    to the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to maintain the minimum capital and surplus of MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of South Carolina (“MRSC”),
    formerly The Travelers Life and Annuity Reinsurance Company, at
    the greater of $250,000 or 10% of net loss reserves (loss
    reserves less DAC).

Management does not anticipate that these arrangements will
    place any significant demands upon the Company’s liquidity
    sources.

Litigation.

Various litigation, including
    putative or certified class actions, and various claims and
    assessments against the Company, in addition to those discussed
    elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, have arisen in
    the course of the Company’s business, including, but not
    limited to, in connection with its activities as an insurer,
    employer, investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further,
    state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and
    state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct
    investigations concerning the Company’s compliance with
    applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome
    of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere
    herein in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to herein, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcome of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Other.

Based on management’s analysis of
    its expected cash inflows from operating activities, the
    dividends it receives from subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life, that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance
    regulatory approval and its portfolio of liquid assets and other
    anticipated cash flows, management believes there will be
    sufficient liquidity to enable the Company to make payments on
    debt, make cash dividend payments on its common and preferred
    stock, pay all operating expenses, and meet its cash needs. The
    nature of the Company’s diverse product portfolio and
    customer base lessens the likelihood that normal operations will
    result in any significant strain on liquidity.

Consolidated Cash Flows.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities decreased by $1.4 billion to
    $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
    $8.0 billion for the comparable 2005 period. The decrease
    in operating



cash flows is primarily due to reinsurance receivables related
    to the sale of certain small market recordkeeping businesses.
    Partially offsetting the decrease is an increase in operating
    cash flows in 2006 over the comparable 2005 period is primarily
    attributable to the acquisition of Travelers.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.0 billion
    and $6.5 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The $1.5 billion increase in
    operating cash flows in 2005 over the comparable 2004 period was
    primarily attributable to the acquisition of Travelers, growth
    in disability, dental, LTC business, group life and
    retirement & savings, as well as continued growth in
    the annuity business.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased by
    $0.9 billion to $15.4 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $14.5 billion for the
    comparable 2005 period. Net cash provided by financing
    activities increased primarily as a result of an increase of
    $7.2 billion in the amount of securities lending cash
    collateral received in connection with the securities lending
    program, a decrease in long-term debt repayments of
    $0.7 billion and an increase of short-term debt borrowings
    of $0.1 billion. Such increases were offset by decreases in
    financing cash flows resulting from a decrease in issuance of
    preferred stock, junior subordinated debt securities, and
    long-term debt aggregating $5.7 billion which were
    principally used to finance the acquisition of Travelers in 2005
    combined with a decrease of $0.9 billion associated with a
    decrease in net policyholder account balance deposits and an
    increase of $0.5 billion of treasury stock acquired under
    the share repurchase program which was resumed in the fourth
    quarter of 2006.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $14.5 billion
    and $8.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The $6.2 billion increase in net
    cash provided by financing activities in 2005 over the
    comparable 2004 period was primarily attributable to the Holding
    Company’s funding of the acquisition of Travelers through
    the issuance of long-term debt, junior subordinated debt
    securities and preferred shares. In addition, there was an
    increase in the amount of securities lending cash collateral
    invested in connection with the program. This increase was
    partially offset by a decrease in net cash provided by PABs, the
    repayment of previously issued long-term debt, the payment of
    common stock dividends, the payment of dividends on the
    preferred shares, the payment of debt and equity issuance costs,
    and the repurchase of its common stock by RGA.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by
    $3.7 billion to $18.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 from $22.6 billion for the
    comparable 2005 period. Net cash used in investing activities in
    the prior year included cash used to acquire Travelers of
    $11.0 billion, less cash acquired of $0.9 billion for
    a net total cash paid of $10.1 billion, which was funded by
    $6.8 billion in securities issuances and $4.2 billion
    of cash provided by operations and the sale of invested assets.
    During the current year, cash available for investment as a
    result of cash collateral received in connection with the
    securities lending program increased by $7.2 billion. Cash
    available from operations and available for investment decreased
    by $1.4 billion. Cash available for the purchase of
    invested assets increased by $4.3 billion as a result of
    the increase in securities lending activities of
    $7.2 billion as well as a decrease in the cash required for
    acquisitions of $4.2 billion, offset by the decrease in
    issuance of preferred stock, junior subordinated debt
    securities, and long-term debt aggregating $5.7 billion as
    well as the decrease in cash flow from operations of
    $1.4 billion. Cash available for investing activities was
    used to increase purchases of fixed maturity securities, other
    invested assets, and short-term investments, as well as increase
    the origination of mortgage and consumer loans and decrease net
    sales of real estate and real estate joint ventures and equity
    securities.

Net cash used in investing activities was $22.6 billion and
    $14.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005
    and 2004, respectively. The $8.2 billion increase in net
    cash used in investing activities in 2005 over the comparable
    2004 period was primarily due to the acquisition of Travelers
    and CitiStreet Associates, the increase in net purchases of
    fixed maturity securities and an increase in the origination of
    mortgage and consumer loans, primarily in commercial loans, as
    compared to the 2004 period. This was partially offset by an
    increase in repayments of mortgage and consumer loans, an
    increase in sales of equity real estate and a decrease in the
    cash used for short-term investments. In addition, the 2005
    period includes proceeds associated with the sale of SSRM and
    MetLife Indonesia.

Capital

Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies and
    Financial Holding Companies —
    Capital.

The Holding Company and its insured
    depository institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, are subject to
    risk-based and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal
    banking regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding
    companies. The federal banking regulatory agencies are required
    by law to take specific prompt corrective actions with respect
    to institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. As
    of their most recently filed reports with the federal banking
    regulatory agencies, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank met the
    minimum capital standards as per federal banking regulatory
    agencies with all of MetLife Bank’s risk-based and leverage
    capital ratios meeting the federal banking regulatory
    agencies’ “well capitalized” standards and all of
    MetLife, Inc.’s risk-based and leverage capital ratios
    meeting the “adequately capitalized” standards.

Liquidity

Liquidity is managed to preserve stable, reliable and
    cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future
    financial obligations and is provided by a variety of sources,
    including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of
    short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale
    financial markets and the ability to borrow through committed
    credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active participant
    in the global financial markets through which it obtains a
    significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as
    cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of the
    Holding Company’s liquidity management. Decisions to access
    these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views
    of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile. A
    disruption in the financial markets could limit the Holding
    Company’s access to liquidity.

The Holding Company’s ability to maintain regular access to
    competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current
    high credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies.
    Management views its capital ratios, credit quality, stable and
    diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and its
    liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining high
    credit ratings.



Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity
    risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid
    asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow
    obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and
    debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the
    Holding Company’s liquidity.

Liquidity
    Sources

Dividends.

The primary source of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity is dividends it receives from its
    insurance subsidiaries. The Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their
    respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is based on the surplus to
    policyholders as of the immediately preceding calendar year and
    statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding
    calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by
    insurance regulators of various states in which the Company
    conducts business, differ in certain respects from accounting
    principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity
    with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment
    of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment
    reserves, reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus
    notes.

The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid to
    the Holding Company without insurance regulatory approval and
    dividends paid to the Holding Company:

MetLife Mexico S.A. paid $116 million in dividends to the
    Holding Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. For
    the year ended December 31, 2006, there were returns of
    capital of $154 million to the Holding Company from other
    subsidiaries.

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and marketable fixed maturity securities.
    At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Holding Company had
    $3.9 billion and $668 million in liquid assets,
    respectively.

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of both short-term and long-term
    instruments, commercial paper, medium- and long-term debt,
    capital securities and stockholders’ equity. The diversity
    of the Holding Company’s funding sources enhances funding
    flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds and
    generally lowers the cost of funds. Other sources of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity include programs for short-and
    long-term borrowing, as needed.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Holding Company had
    $616 million and $961 million in short-term debt
    outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    the Holding Company had $7.0 billion and $7.3 billion



of unaffiliated long-term debt outstanding, respectively. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Holding Company had
    $500 million and $286 million of affiliated long-term
    debt outstanding, respectively.

On April 27, 2005, the Holding Company filed a shelf
    registration statement (the “2005 Registration
    Statement”) with the SEC, covering $11 billion of
    securities. On May 27, 2005, the 2005 Registration
    Statement became effective, permitting the offer and sale, from
    time to time, of a wide range of debt and equity securities. In
    addition to the $11 billion of securities registered on the
    2005 Registration Statement, $3.9 billion of registered but
    unissued securities remained available for issuance by the
    Holding Company as of such date, from the $5.0 billion
    shelf registration statement filed with the SEC during the first
    quarter of 2004, permitting the Holding Company to issue an
    aggregate of $14.9 billion of registered securities. The
    terms of any offering will be established at the time of the
    offering.

During December 2006, the Holding Company issued
    $1.25 billion of junior subordinated debentures under the
    2005 Registration Statement. During June 2005, in connection
    with the Holding Company’s acquisition of Travelers, the
    Holding Company issued $2.0 billion senior notes,
    $2.07 billion of common equity units and $2.1 billion
    of preferred stock under the 2005 Registration Statement. In
    addition, $0.7 billion of senior notes were sold outside
    the United States in reliance upon Regulation S under the
    Securities Act of 1933, as amended, a portion of which may be
    resold in the United States under the 2005 Registration
    Statement. Remaining capacity under the 2005 Registration
    Statement after such issuances is $5.4 billion.

Debt Issuances.

On December 21, 2006, the
    Holding Company issued junior subordinated debentures with a
    face amount of $1.25 billion. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Debt
    Issuances” for further information.

On September 29, 2006, the Holding Company issued
    $204 million of affiliated long-term debt with an interest
    rate of 6.07% maturing in 2016.

On March 31, 2006, the Holding Company issued
    $10 million of affiliated long-term debt with an interest
    rate of 5.70% maturing in 2016.

On December 30, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    $286 million of affiliated long-term debt with an interest
    rate of 5.24% maturing in 2015.

On June 23, 2005, the Holding Company issued in the United
    States public market $1,000 million aggregate principal
    amount of 5.00% senior notes due June 15, 2015 at a
    discount of $2.7 million ($997.3 million), and
    $1,000 million aggregate principal amount of
    5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035 at a discount of
    $2.4 million ($997.6 million).

On June 29, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    400 million pounds sterling ($729.2 million at
    issuance) aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes
    due June 29, 2020 at a discount of 4.5 million pounds
    sterling ($8.1 million at issuance), for aggregate proceeds
    of 395.5 million pounds sterling ($721.1 million at
    issuance). The senior notes were initially offered and sold
    outside the United States in reliance upon Regulation S
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

See also “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Sources — Common Equity Units” for a description
    of $2,134 million of junior subordinated debt securities
    issued in connection with the issuance of common equity units.

Preferred Stock.

On June 13, 2005, the
    Holding Company issued 24 million shares of Floating Rate
    Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the
    “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $600 million.

On June 16, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    60 million shares of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock,
    Series B (the “Series B preferred shares,”
    together with the Series A preferred shares, collectively,
    the “Preferred Shares”) with a $0.01 par value
    per share, and a liquidation preference of $25 per share for
    aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Preferred Shares rank senior to the common stock with
    respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on the
    Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the Preferred
    Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments only when,
    as and if declared by the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors or a duly authorized committee of the board. If
    dividends are declared on the Series A preferred shares,
    they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of
    the greater of: (i) 1.00% above three-month LIBOR on the
    related LIBOR determination date; or (ii) 4.00%. Any
    dividends declared on the Series B preferred shares will be
    payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual fixed rate of 6.50%.
    Accordingly, in the event that dividends are not declared on the
    Preferred Shares for payment on any dividend payment date, then
    those dividends will cease to accrue and be payable. If a
    dividend is not declared before the dividend payment date, the
    Holding Company has no obligation to pay dividends accrued for
    that dividend period whether or not dividends are declared and
    paid in future periods. No dividends may, however, be paid or
    declared on the Holding Company’s common stock —
    or any other securities ranking junior to the Preferred
    Shares — unless the full dividends for the latest
    completed dividend period on all Preferred Shares, and any
    parity stock, have been declared and paid or provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Holding
    Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn
    sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.



The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share,
    plus declared and unpaid dividends.

See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Uses — Dividends.”

Common Equity Units.

In connection with
    financing the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005, the
    Holding Company distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375%
    common equity units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a
    registered public offering on June 21, 2005.

Each common equity unit has an initial stated amount of
    $25 per unit and consists of:

•

a 1/80, or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership
    interest in a series A trust preferred security of MetLife
    Capital Trust II (“Series A Trust”), with an
    initial liquidation amount of $1,000.

•

a 1/80, or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership
    interest in a series B trust preferred security of MetLife
    Capital Trust III (“Series B Trust” and,
    together with the Series A Trust, the “Trusts”),
    with an initial liquidation amount of $1,000.

•

a stock purchase contract under which the holder of the common
    equity unit will purchase and the Holding Company will sell, on
    each of the initial stock purchase date and the subsequent stock
    purchase date, a variable number of shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for
    a purchase price of $12.50.

The Holding Company issued $1,067 million 4.82%
    Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior
    subordinated debt securities due no later than February 15,
    2039 and February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $2,070 million in
    aggregate proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred
    securities by the Trusts and $64 million in trust common
    securities issued equally by the Trusts. The common and
    preferred securities of the Trusts, totaling
    $2,134 million, represent undivided beneficial ownership
    interests in the assets of the Trusts, have no stated maturity
    and must be redeemed upon maturity of the corresponding series
    of junior subordinated debt securities — the sole
    assets of the respective Trusts. The Series A and
    Series B Trusts will make quarterly distributions on the
    common and preferred securities at an annual rate of 4.82% and
    4.91%, respectively.

The Holding Company has directly guaranteed the repayment of the
    trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent
    that there are funds available in the Trusts. The guarantee will
    remain in place until the full redemption of the trust preferred
    securities. The trust preferred securities held by the common
    equity unit holders are pledged to the Holding Company to
    collateralize the obligation of the common equity unit holders
    under the related stock purchase contracts. The common equity
    unit holder may substitute certain zero coupon treasury
    securities in place of the trust preferred securities as
    collateral under the stock purchase contract.

The trust preferred securities have remarketing dates which
    correspond with the initial and subsequent stock purchase dates
    to provide the holders of the common equity units with the
    proceeds to exercise the stock purchase contracts. The initial
    stock purchase date is expected to be August 15, 2008, but
    could be deferred for quarterly periods until February 15,
    2009, and the subsequent stock purchase date is expected to be
    February 15, 2009, but could be deferred for quarterly
    periods until February 15, 2010. At the remarketing date,
    the remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the
    interest rate on the trust preferred securities to generate
    sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the common equity
    unit holder’s obligation under the stock purchase contract,
    subject to a reset cap for each of the first two attempted
    remarketings of each series. The interest rate on the supporting
    junior subordinated debt securities issued by the Holding
    Company will be reset at a commensurate rate. If the initial
    remarketing is unsuccessful, the remarketing agent will attempt
    to remarket the trust preferred securities, as necessary, in
    subsequent quarters through February 15, 2009 for the
    Series A trust preferred securities and through
    February 15, 2010 for the Series B trust preferred
    securities. The final attempt at remarketing will not be subject
    to the reset cap. If all remarketing attempts are unsuccessful,
    the Holding Company has the right, as a secured party, to apply
    the liquidation amount on the trust preferred securities to the
    common equity unit holders obligation under the stock purchase
    contract and to deliver to the common equity unit holder a
    junior subordinated debt security payable on



August 15, 2010 at an annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91% on the
    Series A and Series B trust preferred securities,
    respectively, in payment of any accrued and unpaid distributions.

Each stock purchase contract requires (i) the Holding
    Company to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly
    contract payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual
    rate of 1.510% on the stated amount of $25 per stock
    purchase contract until the initial stock purchase date and at
    the annual rate of 1.465% on the remaining stated amount of
    $12.50 per stock purchase contract thereafter; and
    (ii) the holder of the common equity unit to purchase, and
    the Holding Company to sell, for $12.50, on each of the initial
    stock purchase date and the subsequent stock purchase date, a
    number of newly issued or treasury shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
    equal to the applicable settlement rate. The settlement rate at
    the respective stock purchase date will be calculated based on
    the closing price of the common stock during a specified

20-day

period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date.
    Accordingly, upon settlement in the aggregate, the Holding
    Company will receive proceeds of $2,070 million and issue
    between 39.0 million and 47.8 million shares of common
    stock. The stock purchase contract may be exercised at the
    option of the holder at any time prior to the settlement date.
    However, upon early settlement, the holder will receive the
    minimum settlement rate.

Credit Facilities.

The Holding Company
    maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating
    $3.0 billion ($1.5 billion expiring in each of 2009
    and 2010, which it shares with MetLife Funding) as of
    December 31, 2006. Borrowings under these facilities bear
    interest at varying rates as stated in the agreements. These
    facilities are primarily used for general corporate purposes and
    as

back-up

lines of credit for the borrowers’ commercial paper
    programs. At December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings
    against these credit facilities. At December 31, 2006,
    $970 million of the unsecured credit facilities support the
    letters of credit issued on behalf of the Company, all of which
    is in support of letters of credit issued on behalf of the
    Holding Company.

Committed Facilities.

    capacity and outstanding balances of all committed facilities as

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2006,
    the Holding Company had $970 million in outstanding letters
    of credit from various banks. Since commitments associated with
    letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused,
    these amounts do not necessarily reflect the Holding
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.



Liquidity
    Uses

The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include
    debt service, cash dividends on common and preferred stock,
    capital contributions to subsidiaries, payment of general

Future common stock dividend decisions will be determined by the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors after taking into
    consideration factors such as the Company’s current
    earnings, expected medium- and long-term earnings, financial
    condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable
    governmental regulations and policies. Furthermore, the payment
    of dividends and other distributions to the Holding Company by
    its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and
    regulations.

Affiliated Capital Transactions.

During the
    years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Holding Company
    invested an aggregate of $1.8 billion and
    $904 million, respectively, in various affiliated
    transactions.

On December 12, 2005, RGA repurchased 1.6 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate price of
    $76 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement
    with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to RGA from
    third parties and purchased the shares in the open market over
    the subsequent few months to return to the lenders. RGA would
    either pay or receive an amount based on the actual amount paid
    by the bank to purchase the shares. These repurchases resulted
    in an increase in the Company’s ownership percentage of RGA
    to approximately 53% at December 31, 2005 from
    approximately 52% at December 31, 2004. In February 2006,
    the final purchase price was determined, resulting in a cash
    settlement substantially equal to the aggregate cost. RGA
    recorded the initial repurchase of shares as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
    ownership was approximately 53% of RGA.



The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. Such loans are included in loans to affiliates and

Debt Repayments.

The Holding Company repaid a
    $500 million 5.25% senior note which matured on
    December 1, 2006 and a $1,006 million
    3.911% senior note which matured on May 15, 2005.

Share Repurchase.

On October 26, 2004,
    the Holding Company’s Board of Directors authorized a
    $1 billion common stock repurchase program, of which
    $216 million remained as of December 31, 2006. On
    February 27, 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock
    repurchase program. Upon the date of this authorization, the
    amount remaining under these repurchase programs is
    approximately $1.2 billion. Under these authorizations, the
    Holding Company may purchase its common stock from the MetLife
    Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to
    the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and in
    privately negotiated transactions. As a result of the
    acquisition of Travelers, the Holding Company had suspended its
    common stock repurchase activity. During the fourth quarter of
    2006, as announced, the Holding Company resumed its share
    repurchase program.

On December 1, 2006, the Holding Company repurchased
    3,993,024 shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $232 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the common stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties
    and purchased the common stock in the open market to return to
    such third parties. In February 2007, the Holding Company paid a
    cash adjustment of $8 million for a final purchase price of
    $240 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

On December 16, 2004, the Holding Company repurchased
    7,281,553 shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $300 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties and
    purchased the common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. In April 2005, the Holding Company received a
    cash adjustment of $7 million based on the actual amount
    paid by the bank to purchase the common stock, for a final
    purchase price of $293 million. The Holding Company
    recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock.

The following table summarizes the 2006, 2005 and 2004 common
    stock repurchase activity of the Holding Company, which includes
    the accelerated common stock repurchase agreements in the fourth
    quarters of 2006 and 2004:

Future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several
    factors, including the Company’s capital position, its
    financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions
    and the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company has
    net worth maintenance agreements with two of its insurance
    subsidiaries, MetLife Investors and First MetLife Investors
    Insurance Company. Under these agreements,



as subsequently amended, the Holding Company agreed, without
    limitation as to the amount, to cause each of these subsidiaries
    to have a minimum capital and surplus of $10 million, total
    adjusted capital at a level not less than 150% of the company
    action level RBC, as defined by state insurance statutes,
    and liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current
    obligations on a timely basis. As of the date of the most recent
    statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators,
    the capital and surplus of each of these subsidiaries was in
    excess of the minimum capital and surplus amounts referenced
    above, and their total adjusted capital was in excess of the
    most recent referenced RBC-based amount calculated at
    December 31, 2006.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers, the Holding
    Company committed to the South Carolina Department of Insurance
    to take necessary action to maintain the minimum capital and
    surplus of MRSC, formerly The Travelers Life and Annuity
    Reinsurance Company, at the greater of $250,000 or 10% of net
    loss reserves (loss reserves less deferred policy acquisition
    costs).

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with MSMIC, an investment in Japan of which the
    Holding Company owns approximately 50% of the equity. Under the
    agreement, the Holding Company agreed, without limitation as to
    amount, to cause MSMIC to have the amount of capital and surplus
    necessary for MSMIC to maintain a solvency ratio of at least
    400%, as calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business
    Law of Japan, and to make such loans to MSMIC as may be
    necessary to ensure that MSMIC has sufficient cash or other
    liquid assets to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
    As of the date of the most recent calculation, the capital and
    surplus of MSMIC was in excess of the minimum capital and
    surplus amount referenced above.

Based on management’s analysis and comparison of its
    current and future cash inflows from the dividends it receives
    from subsidiaries, including Metropolitan Life, that are
    permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory
    approval, its portfolio of liquid assets, anticipated securities
    issuances and other anticipated cash flows, management believes
    there will be sufficient liquidity to enable the Holding Company
    to make payments on debt, make cash dividend payments on its
    common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its
    subsidiaries, pay all operating expenses and meet its cash needs.

Subsequent
    Events

On February 27, 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock
    repurchase program. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Uses — Share Repurchase” for further information.

On February 16, 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors announced dividends of $0.3975000 per share, for
    a total of $10 million, on its Series A preferred
    shares, and $0.4062500 per share, for a total of
    $24 million, on its Series B preferred shares, subject
    to the final confirmation that it has met the financial tests
    specified in the Series A and Series B preferred
    shares, which the Holding Company anticipates will be made on or
    about March 5, 2007, the earliest date permitted in
    accordance with the terms of the securities. Both dividends will
    be payable March 15, 2007 to shareholders of record as of
    February 28, 2007.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $3.0 billion and
    $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company anticipates that these amounts will be
    invested in partnerships over the next five years. There are no
    other obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements
    that are reasonably likely to become material.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company commits to lend funds under mortgage loan
    commitments. The amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $4.0 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The purpose of these



loans is to enhance the Company’s total return on its
    investment portfolio. There are no other obligations or
    liabilities arising from such arrangements that are reasonably
    likely to become material.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities and Bridge
    Loans

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities
    and bridge loans. The amounts of these unfunded commitments were
    $1.9 billion and $346 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The purpose of these commitments
    and any related fundings is to enhance the Company’s total
    return on its investment portfolio. There are no other
    obligations or liabilities arising from such arrangements that
    are reasonably likely to become material.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and
    sublease agreements for office space, data processing and other
    equipment. The Company’s commitments under such lease
    agreements are included within the contractual obligations
    table. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    Uses — Investment and Other.”

Credit
    Facilities and Letters of Credit

The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities
    and letters of credit with various financial institutions. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity Sources — Credit
    Facilities” and “— Letters of Credit”
    for further descriptions of such arrangements.

Share-Based
    Arrangements

In connection with the issuance of the common equity units, the
    Holding Company has issued forward stock purchase contracts
    under which the Holding Company will issue, in 2008 and 2009,
    between 39.0 and 47.8 million shares, depending upon
    whether the share price is greater than $43.45 and less than
    $53.10. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    Sources — Common Equity Units.”

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $2 billion, with a cumulative maximum of
    $3.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are not
    specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are
    not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it
    is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could
    become due under these guarantees in the future.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount,



the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine
    the maximum potential amount that could become due under these
    guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company did
    not record any additional liabilities for indemnities,
    guarantees and commitments. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
    Company eliminated $4 million of a liability that was
    previously recorded with respect to indemnities provided in
    connection with a certain disposition. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 for
    indemnities, guarantees and commitments were $5 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    requiring payment of principal due in exchange for the
    referenced credit obligation, depending on the nature or
    occurrence of specified credit events for the referenced
    entities. In the event of a specified credit event, the
    Company’s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the
    referenced credits becomes worthless, was $396 million at
    December 31, 2006. The credit default swaps expire at
    various times during the next ten years.

Other
    Commitments

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”) is a
    member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the
    “FHLB of Boston”) and holds $70 million of common
    stock of the FHLB of Boston, which is included in equity
    securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
    MICC has also entered into several funding agreements with the
    FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has issued such funding agreements
    in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of Boston has been
    granted a blanket lien on MICC’s residential mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MICC’s
    obligations under the funding agreements. MICC maintains control
    over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or
    dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no
    event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is
    sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The
    funding agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery is limited
    to the amount of MICC’s liability under the outstanding
    funding agreements. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was
    $926 million and $1.1 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, which is included in PABs.

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Description
    of Plans

Plan
    Description Overview

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and either final average or career average
    earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2006, virtually all of the Subsidiaries’
    obligations have been calculated using the traditional formula.
    The non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits,
    in excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to
    certain executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for a covered subsidiary, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees or their
    beneficiaries contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy postretirement medical
    benefits.

Financial
    Summary

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, establishes the
    accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87, the
    projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. The PBO and ABO of the pension plans are set forth in
    the following section.

Prior to December 31, 2006, SFAS 87 also required the
    recognition of an additional minimum pension liability and an
    intangible asset (limited to unrecognized prior service cost) if
    the market value of pension plan assets was less than the ABO at
    the measurement date. The excess of the additional minimum
    pension liability over the allowable intangible asset was
    charged, net of taxes, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. The Company’s additional minimum pension liability
    was $78 million, and the intangible asset was
    $12 million, at December 31, 2005. The excess of the
    additional minimum pension liability over the intangible asset
    of $66 million ($41 million, net of income tax) was
    recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s additional
    minimum pension liability was $92 million. The minimum
    pension liability of $59 million, net of income tax of
    $33 million, was recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive income.

SFAS No. 106,

Employers Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,

as amended,
    (“SFAS 106”), establishes the accounting for
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike the PBO for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligations (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement
    benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a
    particular date. The APBO is recorded in the financial
    statements and is set forth below.

As described more fully in “ — Adoption of New
    Accounting Pronouncements”, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans

—

an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS 158”), effective December 31, 2006.
    Upon adoption, the Company was required to recognize in the
    consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans. Funded status is
    measured as the difference between the fair



value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, which is the
    PBO for pension plans and the APBO for other postretirement
    plans. The change to recognize funded status eliminated the
    additional minimum pension liability provisions of SFAS 87.
    In addition, the Company recognized as an adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, net of income tax, those
    amounts of actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and
    credits, and the remaining net transition asset or obligation
    that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as
    of the date of adoption. The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted
    in a reduction of $744 million, net of income tax, to
    accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included as a
    component of total consolidated stockholders’ equity. The
    following table summarizes the adjustments to the
    December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet in order to
    effect the adoption of SFAS 158.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit pension
    plans are determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine
    the present value of future benefit payments, the expected rate
    of compensation increases and average expected retirement age.

Assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as
    follows:

December 31,



Weighted average discount rate

6.00%

5.82%

Rate of compensation increase

3% - 8%

3% - 8%

Average expected retirement age



The discount rate is determined annually based on the yield,
    measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio
    constructed of high-quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate PBO when due. The yield of this
    hypothetical portfolio, constructed of bonds rated AA or better
    by Moody’s Investors Services resulted in a discount rate
    of approximately 6.00% and 5.82% for the defined pension plans
    as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.



A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the PBO. This increase (decrease) to the PBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2006 PBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the PBO of approximately $180 million. At the
    end of 2006, total net actuarial losses were
    $1,123 million, as compared to $1,528 million in 2005.
    The majority of these net actuarial losses are due to lower
    discount rates in recent years. These losses will be amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service
    period of active employees expected to receive benefits under
    the benefit plans. At the end of 2006, the average remaining
    service period of active employees was 8.2 years for the
    pension plans.

As the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are
    calculated as a percentage of future earnings, an assumption of
    future compensation increases is required to determine the
    projected benefit obligation. These rates are derived through
    periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted by an
    independent actuarial firm. The last review of such data was
    conducted using salary information through 2003 and the Company
    believes that no circumstances have subsequently occurred that
    would result in a material change to the compensation rate
    assumptions.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

The APBO is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate, the healthcare
    cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age. The
    determination of the discount rate and the average expected
    retirement age are substantially consistent with the
    determination described previously for the pension plans.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-Medicare eligible claims

9.0% down to 5% in 2014

9.5% down to 5% in 2014

Medicare eligible claims

11.0% down to 5% in 2018

11.5% down to 5% in 2018

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. A
    one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend
    rates would have the following effects:

One Percent

One Percent

(In millions)

Effect on total of service and
    interest cost components

$


$

(12

)

Effect of accumulated
    postretirement benefit obligation

$


$

(147

)

A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the APBO. This increase (decrease) to the APBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2006 APBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the APBO of approximately $60 million.

At the end of 2006, total net actuarial losses were
    $328 million, as compared to $377 million in 2005. The
    majority of the net actuarial losses are due to lower discount
    rates in recent years, an increase in expected healthcare
    inflation and changes in demographic assumptions. These losses
    will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
    remaining service period of active employees expected to receive
    benefits under the other postretirement benefit plans. At the
    end of 2006, the average remaining service period of active
    employees was 9.6 years for the other postretirement
    benefit plans.

The Company began receiving subsidies on prescription drug
    benefits during 2006 under the Medicare Prescription Drug,
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
    “Prescription Drug Act”). The APBO was remeasured
    effective July 1, 2004 in order to determine the effect of
    the expected subsidies on net periodic other postretirement
    benefit cost. As a result, the APBO was reduced by
    $213 million at July 1, 2004. A summary of the



reduction to the APBO and related reductions in the components
    of net periodic postretirement benefit cost is as follows:

    September 30, 2006 and expects to receive an additional
    $2 million in 2007 for prescription claims processed
    October 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Pension
    Cost

Net periodic pension cost is comprised of the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    projected pension benefit obligation resulting from benefits
    payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service rendered
    during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the projected pension benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    pension fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service
    provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation
    of new plans. As the economic benefits of these costs are
    realized in the future periods, these costs are amortized to
    pension expense over the expected service years of the employees.

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on pension plan
    assets or projected pension benefit obligation during a
    particular period. These gains and losses are accumulated and,
    to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected
    pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
    assets, they are amortized into pension expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.



The Subsidiaries recognized pension expense of $180 million
    in 2006 as compared to $146 million in 2005 and
    $129 million in 2004. The major components of net periodic
    pension cost described above were as follows:

    (credit)

$


$


The increase in expense was primarily a result of both increases
    in service and interest cost and amortization of net actuarial
    losses resulting largely from lower discount rates, partially
    offset by the impact of an increase in the expected return on
    plan assets due to a larger plan assets base.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for
    the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit
    cost over the next year are $54 million and
    $12 million, respectively.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic pension cost was 5.82%, 5.83% and 6.10% for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan
    assets used to calculate the net periodic pension cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 8.25%,
    8.50% and 8.50%, respectively. The expected rate of return on
    plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various
    asset sectors in which the plan invests, weighted by target
    allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based
    on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector,
    adjusted for the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on
    the performance of the markets. While the precise expected
    return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to
    year, the Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term
    assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable
    tolerance from the derived rate. The actual net return on the
    investments has been an approximation of the estimated return
    for the pension plan in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Based on the December 31, 2006 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $15 million for the pension
    plans.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Cost

The net periodic other postretirement benefit cost consists of
    the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligation resulting from
    benefits payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service
    rendered during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the expected postretirement benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    other postretirement fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to other postretirement benefit cost
    for service provided in prior years due to amendments in plans
    or initiation of new plans. As the economic benefits of these
    costs are realized in the future periods these costs are
    amortized to other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.



v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on other
    postretirement benefit plan assets or expected postretirement
    plan benefit obligation during a particular year. These gains
    and losses are accumulated and, to the extent they exceed 10% of
    the greater of the accumulated postretirement plan benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, they are
    amortized into other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

The Subsidiaries recognized other postretirement benefit expense
    of $60 million in 2006 as compared to $77 million in
    2005 and $62 million in 2004. The major components of net
    periodic other postretirement benefit cost described above were
    as follows:

The increase in expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result
    of increases in service and interest cost as well as increased
    amortization of net actuarial losses resulting largely from
    lower discount rates. Despite a continued increase in
    amortization of net actuarial losses due to lower discount rates
    in recent years, the other postretirement benefit expense
    decreased from 2005 to 2006 due to changes in plan benefits that
    resulted in decreased service and interest cost and increases in
    amortization of prior service credits.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credit for
    the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized
    from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next year are $14 million and
    $36 million, respectively.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic postretirement cost was 5.82%, 5.98% and 6.20% for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used
    to calculate the net other postretirement benefit cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 7.42%,
    7.51% and 7.91%, respectively. The expected rate of return on
    plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various
    asset sectors in which the plan invests, weighted by target
    allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based
    on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector,
    adjusted for the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on
    the performance of the markets. While the precise expected
    return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to
    year, the Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term
    assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable
    tolerance from the derived rate. The actual net return on the
    investments has been an approximation of the estimated return
    for the other postretirement plans in 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Based on the December 31, 2006 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $3 million for the other
    postretirement plans.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Pension
    Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the pension plans are invested
    within group annuity and life insurance contracts issued by the
    Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in separate
    accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account values of
    assets held with the Subsidiaries were $6,205 million and
    $5,432 million as of December 31, 2006



and 2005, respectively. The terms of these contracts are
    consistent in all material respects with those the Subsidiaries
    offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

Net assets invested in separate accounts are stated at the
    aggregate fair value of units of participation. Such value
    reflects accumulated contributions, dividends and realized and
    unrealized investment gains or losses apportioned to such
    contributions, less withdrawals, distributions, allocable
    expenses relating to the purchase, sale and maintenance of the
    assets and an allocable part of such separate accounts’
    investment expenses.

Separate account investments in fixed income and equity
    securities are generally carried at published market value, or
    if published market values are not readily available, at
    estimated market values. Investments in short-term fixed income
    securities are generally reflected as cash equivalents and
    carried at fair value. Real estate investments are carried at
    estimated fair value based on appraisals performed by
    third-party real estate appraisal firms, and generally,
    determined by discounting projected cash flows over periods of
    time and at interest rates deemed appropriate for each
    investment. Information on the physical value of the property
    and the sales prices of comparable properties is used to
    corroborate fair value estimates. Estimated fair value of hedge
    fund net assets is generally determined by third-party pricing
    vendors using quoted market prices or through the use of pricing
    models which are affected by changes in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates, financial indices, credit spreads,
    market supply and demand, market volatility and liquidity.

    weighted-average allocations of pension plan assets within the

    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the other postretirement benefit
    plans are invested within life insurance and reserve contracts
    issued by the Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in
    separate accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account
    values of assets held with the Subsidiaries were
    $1,116 million and $1,039 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The terms of
    these contracts are consistent in all material respects with
    those the Subsidiaries offer to unaffiliated parties that are
    similarly situated.

The valuation of separate accounts and the investments within
    such separate accounts invested in by the other postretirement
    plans are similar to that described in the preceding section on
    pension plans.

Funding
    and Cash Flows of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of the ERISA, as amended,

and/or

to
    maintain a fully funded ABO. In accordance with such practice,
    no contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 or 2005. No contributions will be
    required for 2007. The Subsidiaries elected to make
    discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plans of
    $350 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. No
    contributions were made during the year ended December 31,
    2005. The Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions of $150 million in 2007.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $38 million and $35 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These benefit
    payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in
    2007.

Gross pension benefit payments for the next ten years, which
    reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to
    be as follows:

Pension

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have funded such plans in
    advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to use
    their general assets to pay claims as they come due in lieu of
    utilizing plan assets. These payments totaled $152 million
    and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively.



The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $132 million, based upon expected gross benefit payments,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2007. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

Gross other postretirement benefit payments for the next ten
    years, which reflect expected future service where appropriate,
    and gross subsidies to be received under the Prescription Drug
    Act are expected to be as follows:

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require life insurers doing business within
    the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which
    are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to
    insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed life
    insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed
    limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the
    basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by
    member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired,
    insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member
    insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial
    premium tax offsets. Assets and liabilities held for insolvency
    assessments are as follows:

    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material
    effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar
    as inflation may affect interest rates.



Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there is no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the SEC in Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

(“SAB 107”) — using the modified
    prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods have
    not been restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of
    all stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS 123 on a
    prospective basis effective January 1, 2003, and prior to
    January 1, 2003, accounted for its stock-based awards to
    employees under the intrinsic value method prescribed by
    APB 25. The Company did not modify the substantive terms of
    any existing awards prior to adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).

The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested
    prior to the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1,
    2003. As required by SFAS 148, and carried forward in the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r), the Company discloses the pro
    forma impact as if stock-based awards accounted for under
    APB 25 had been accounted for under the fair value method.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.



Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has adopted guidance relating to derivative
    financial instruments as follows:

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging

(“SFAS 133”) and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;

(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
    qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”) from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely from the
    embedded call options in the underlying financial assets. The
    adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument through Exercise
    of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue
    B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
    Call Options That Are Exercisable Only by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies that the potential
    settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a creditor occurring
    upon exercise of a put or call option meets the net settlement
    criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39 clarifies that an embedded
    call option, in which the underlying is an interest rate or
    interest rate index, that can accelerate the settlement of a
    debt host financial instrument should not be bifurcated and fair
    valued if the right to accelerate the settlement can be
    exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower) and the investor
    will recover substantially all of its initial net investment.
    The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Other
    Pronouncements

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF

05-7”).

EITF

05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized upon the
    modification as a discount (or premium) associated with the
    debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of EITF

05-7

did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF

05-8”).

EITF

05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a temporary difference; and
    (ii) the establishment of the deferred tax liability for
    the basis difference should result in an adjustment to
    additional paid-in capital. EITF

05-8

was
    applied retrospectively for all instruments with a beneficial
    conversion feature accounted for in accordance with EITF Issue

No. 98-5,

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios

, and EITF Issue

No. 00-27,

Application of Issue

No. 98-5

to Certain Convertible Instruments.

The adoption
    of EITF

05-8

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(“SFAS 154”).
    SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
    periods’ financial statements for a voluntary change in
    accounting principle unless it is deemed impracticable. It also
    requires that a change in the method of depreciation,
    amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets
    be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate rather than
    a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS 154
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF

04-5”).

EITF

04-5

provides a framework for determining whether a general partner
    controls and should consolidate a limited partnership or a
    similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited
    partners. The consensus also provides additional guidance on
    substantive rights. EITF

04-5

was
    effective after June 29, 2005 for all newly formed
    partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that
    modified their partnership agreements after that date. For all
    other limited partnerships, EITF

04-5

required adoption by January 1, 2006 through a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in opening
    equity or applied retrospectively by adjusting prior period
    financial statements. The adoption of the provisions of EITF

04-5

did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.



Effective November 9, 2005, the Company prospectively
    adopted the guidance in FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)

No. FAS 140-2,

Clarification of the Application of Paragraphs 40(b) and
    40(c) of FAS 140

(“FSP

140-2”).

FSP

140-2

clarified certain criteria relating to derivatives and
    beneficial interests when considering whether an entity
    qualifies as a QSPE. Under FSP

140-2,

the
    criteria must only be met at the date the QSPE issues beneficial
    interests or when a derivative financial instrument needs to be
    replaced upon the occurrence of a specified event outside the
    control of the transferor. The adoption of FSP

140-2

did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
    amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amended prior
    guidance to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
    similar productive assets and replaced it with a general
    exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
    commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
    substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
    change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions
    of SFAS 153 were required to be applied prospectively for
    fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
    of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-6,

Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold
    Improvements

(“EITF

05-6”).

EITF

05-6

provides guidance on determining the amortization period for
    leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
    acquired subsequent to lease inception. As required by EITF

05-6,

the
    Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis which had
    no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2005, the FASB completed its review of EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF

03-1”).

EITF

03-1

provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when
    an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and
    investments accounted for under the cost method should be
    considered

other-than-temporary

and recognized in income. EITF

03-1

also
    requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for
    debt and marketable equity securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity

under SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, that are impaired
    at the balance sheet date but for which an

other-than-temporary

impairment has not been recognized. The FASB decided not to
    provide additional guidance on the meaning of

other-than-temporary

impairment but has issued FSP Nos.

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP

115-1”),

which nullifies the accounting guidance on the determination of
    whether an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired as set forth in EITF

03-1.

As
    required by FSP

115-1,

the
    Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, which had
    no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, and has provided the required disclosures.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

(“FSP

109-2”).

The AJCA introduced a one-time dividend received deduction on
    the repatriation of certain earnings to a U.S. taxpayer.
    FSP

109-2

provides companies additional time beyond the financial
    reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the
    AJCA on their plans to repatriate foreign earnings for purposes
    of applying SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

During 2005, the Company recorded a
    $27 million income tax benefit related to the repatriation
    of foreign earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue Code
    Section 965 for which a U.S. deferred income tax
    provision had previously been recorded. As of January 1,
    2006, the repatriation provision of the AJCA no longer applies
    to the Company.

Effective July 1, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted
    FSP

No. FAS 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of

(“FSP

106-2”).

FSP

106-2

provides accounting guidance to employers that sponsor
    postretirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug
    benefits. The Company began receiving subsidies on prescription
    drug benefits during 2006 under the Prescription Drug Act based
    on the Company’s determination that the prescription drug
    benefits offered under certain postretirement plans are
    actuarially equivalent to the benefits offered under Medicare
    Part D. The postretirement benefit plan assets and
    accumulated benefit obligation were remeasured to determine the
    effect of the expected subsidies on net periodic postretirement
    benefit cost. As a result, the accumulated postretirement
    benefit obligation was reduced by $213 million at
    July 1, 2004.



Effective July 1, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 03-16,

Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies

(“EITF

03-16”).

EITF

03-16

provides guidance regarding whether a limited liability company
    should be viewed as similar to a corporation or similar to a
    partnership for purposes of determining whether a noncontrolling
    investment should be accounted for using the cost method or the
    equity method of accounting. EITF

03-16

did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective April 1, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128

(“EITF

03-6”).

EITF

03-6

provides guidance on determining whether a security should be
    considered a participating security for purposes of computing
    earnings per common share and how earnings should be allocated
    to the participating security. EITF

03-6

did not
    have an impact on the Company’s earnings per common share
    calculations or amounts.

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted

SOP 03-1

as interpreted by a Technical Practice Aid (“TPA”),
    issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) and FSP

No. FAS 97-1,

Situations in Which Paragraphs 17(b) and 20 of FASB
    Statement No 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments, Permit or Require
    Accrual of an Unearned Revenue Liability.

SOP 03-1

provides guidance on: (i) the classification and valuation
    of long-duration contract liabilities; (ii) the accounting
    for sales inducements; and (iii) separate account
    presentation and valuation. As a result of the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

effective January 1, 2004, the Company decreased the
    liability for future policyholder benefits for changes in the
    methodology relating to various guaranteed death and
    annuitization benefits and for determining liabilities for
    certain universal life insurance contracts by $4 million,
    which was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in
    accounting. This amount is net of corresponding changes in DAC,
    including VOBA and unearned revenue liability, under certain
    variable annuity and life contracts and income tax. Certain
    other contracts sold by the Company provide for a return through
    periodic crediting rates, surrender adjustments or termination
    adjustments based on the total return of a contractually
    referenced pool of assets owned by the Company. To the extent
    that such contracts are not accounted for as derivatives under
    the provisions of SFAS 133 and not already credited to the
    contract account balance, under

SOP 03-1

the change relating to the fair value of the referenced pool of
    assets is recorded as a liability with the change in the
    liability recorded as policyholder benefits and claims. Prior to
    the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the Company recorded the change in such liability as other
    comprehensive income. At adoption, this change decreased net
    income and increased other comprehensive income by
    $63 million, net of income tax, which were recorded as
    cumulative effects of changes in accounting. Effective with the
    adoption of

SOP 03-1,

costs associated with enhanced or bonus crediting rates to
    contractholders must be deferred and amortized over the life of
    the related contract using assumptions consistent with the
    amortization of DAC. Since the Company followed a similar
    approach prior to adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the provisions of

SOP 03-1

relating to sales inducements had no significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. In accordance
    with

SOP 03-1’s

guidance for the reporting of certain separate accounts, at
    adoption, the Company also reclassified $1.7 billion of
    separate account assets to general account investments and
    $1.7 billion of separate account liabilities to future
    policy benefits and PABs. This reclassification decreased net
    income and increased other comprehensive income by
    $27 million, net of income tax, which were reported as
    cumulative effects of changes in accounting. As a result of the
    adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the Company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in
    accounting of $86 million, net of income tax of
    $46 million, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

the
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits all
    entities the option to measure most financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates
    and to report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings.
    The fair value option will generally be applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is generally an irrevocable election. SFAS 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The Company is evaluating which eligible financial
    instruments, if any, it will elect to account for at fair value
    under SFAS 159 and the related impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2006, the FASB issued FSP EITF

00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP EITF

00-19-2”).

FSP EITF

00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or



otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

FSP EITF

00-19-2

is
    effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and
    the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are
    entered into or modified subsequent to December 21, 2006.
    For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to
    December 21, 2006, the guidance in the FSP is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
    does not expect FSP EITF

00-19-2

to
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in GAAP and requires enhanced disclosures
    about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require
    any new fair value measurements. The pronouncement is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
    guidance in SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively with the
    exception of: (i) block discounts of financial instruments;
    and (ii) certain financial and hybrid instruments measured
    at initial recognition under SFAS 133 which is to be
    applied retrospectively as of the beginning of initial adoption
    (a limited form of retrospective application). The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. Implementation
    of SFAS 157 will require additional disclosures in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP

13-2”).

FSP

13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition, FSP

13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The guidance in FSP

13-2

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The Company does not expect FSP

13-2

to have
    a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in a
    company’s financial statements. FIN 48 requires
    companies to determine whether it is “more likely than
    not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
    by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
    benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also
    provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and
    classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any
    related interest and penalties. Previously recorded income tax
    benefits that no longer meet this standard are required to be
    charged to earnings in the period that such determination is
    made. FIN 48 will also require significant additional
    disclosures. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. Based upon the Company’s
    evaluation work completed to date, the Company expects to
    recognize a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings of between $35 million and
    $60 million.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets — an
    amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other requirements,
    SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset
    or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to
    service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract
    in certain situations. SFAS 156 will be applied
    prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect
    SFAS 156 to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2005, the AICPA issued

SOP 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”).

SOP 05-1

provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for DAC
    on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts
    other than those specifically described in
    SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of
    Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement as a modification in product
    benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the
    exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment,
    endorsement, or rider to a



contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a
    contract. It is effective for internal replacements occurring in
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.

In addition, in February 2007 related TPAs were issued by the
    AICPA to provide further clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs are effective concurrently with the adoption of the
    SOP. Based on the Company’s interpretation of

SOP 05-1

and related TPAs, the adoption of

SOP 05-1

will result in a reduction to DAC and VOBA relating primarily to
    the Company’s group life and health insurance contracts
    that contain certain rate reset provisions. The Company
    estimates that the adoption of

SOP 05-1

as of January 1, 2007 will result in a cumulative effect
    adjustment of between $275 million and $310 million,
    net of income tax, which will be recorded as a reduction to
    retained earnings. In addition, the Company estimates that
    accelerated DAC and VOBA amortization will reduce 2007 net
    income by approximately $25 million to $35 million,
    net of income tax.

Investments

The Company’s primary investment objective is to optimize,
    net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income and
    risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and
    liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The
    Company is exposed to three primary sources of investment risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the
    continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of
    principal and interest;

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow
    variability associated with changes in market interest
    rates; and

•

market valuation risk.

The Company manages risk through in-house fundamental analysis
    of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and
    real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk and
    market valuation risk through industry and issuer
    diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and
    agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and market
    valuation risk through geographic, property type and product
    type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages
    interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management
    strategies; product design, such as the use of market value
    adjustment features and surrender charges; and proactive
    monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of
    its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and
    dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The
    Company also uses certain derivative instruments in the
    management of credit and interest rate risks.

Fixed
    Maturity and Equity Securities

Available-for-Sale

Fixed maturity securities consisted principally of publicly
    traded and privately placed debt securities, and represented 73%
    and 75% of total cash and invested assets at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Based on estimated fair value,
    public fixed maturity securities represented
    $210.6 billion, or 87%, and $200.2 billion, or 87%, of
    total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Based on estimated fair value, private fixed
    maturity securities represented $32.8 billion, or 13%, and
    $29.9 billion, or 13%, of total fixed maturity securities
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair
    values are estimated using present value or valuation
    techniques. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about the financial instruments, including estimates
    of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities.

The Securities Valuation Office of the NAIC evaluates the fixed
    maturity investments of insurers for regulatory reporting
    purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment
    categories called “NAIC designations.” The NAIC
    ratings are similar to the rating agency designations of the
    Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations
    (“NRSROs”) for marketable bonds. NAIC ratings 1 and 2
    include bonds generally considered investment grade (rated
    “Baa3” or higher by Moody’s, or rated
    “BBB-” or higher by Standard & Poor’s
    (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings Insurance Group
    (“Fitch”)), by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings
    3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment
    grade (rated “Ba1” or lower by Moody’s, or rated
    “BB+” or lower by S&P and Fitch).

The following table presents the Company’s total fixed
    maturity securities by NRSRO designation and the equivalent
    ratings of the NAIC, as well as the percentage, based on
    estimated fair value, that each designation is comprised of at:

Amounts presented are based on rating agency designations.
    Comparisons between NAIC ratings and rating agency designations
    are published by the NAIC. The rating agency designations are
    based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings
    among Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. Beginning in the third
    quarter of 2005, the Company incorporated Fitch into its rating
    agency designations to be consistent with the Lehman
    Brothers’ ratings convention. If no rating is available
    from a rating agency, then the MetLife rating is used.

The Company held fixed maturity securities at estimated fair
    values that were below investment grade or not rated by an
    independent rating agency that totaled $17.3 billion and
    $15.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. These securities had a net unrealized gain of
    $627 million and $392 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Non-income producing fixed maturity
    securities were $16 million and $15 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Unrealized gains
    (losses) associated with non-income producing fixed maturity
    securities were $4 million and ($3) million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Equity securities primarily consist of investments in common and
    preferred stocks and mutual fund interests. Such securities
    include private equity securities with an estimated fair value
    of $238 million and $472 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Fixed Maturity and Equity Security
    Impairment.

The Company classifies all of its
    fixed maturity and equity securities as

available-for-sale

and marks them to market through other comprehensive income,
    except for non-marketable private equities, which are generally
    carried at cost and trading securities which are carried at fair
    value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net
    investment income. All securities with gross unrealized losses
    at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the
    Company’s process for identifying

other-than-temporary

impairments. The Company writes down to fair value securities
    that it deems to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so
    impaired. The assessment of whether such impairment has occurred
    is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. Management considers a wide range of factors, as
    described in “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Investments,” about the security
    issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the
    decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in
    assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in
    management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions and
    estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential.

The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and equity
    securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total
    gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater. While
    all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment,
    the Company’s experience indicates that the first two
    categories do not present as great a risk of impairment, and
    often, fair values recover over time as the factors that caused
    the declines improve.

The Company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts
    the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis
    for subsequent recoveries in value. Impairments of fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $82 million,
    $64 million and $102 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
    Company’s three largest impairments totaled
    $33 million, $40 million and $53 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    The circumstances that gave rise to these impairments were
    financial restructurings, bankruptcy filings or difficult



underlying operating environments for the entities concerned.
    During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    the Company sold or disposed of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss that had a fair value of
    $70.3 billion, $93.9 billion and $29.9 billion,
    respectively. Gross losses excluding impairments for fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $1.5 billion,
    $1.4 billion and $516 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively.

The following tables present the cost or amortized cost, gross
    unrealized loss and number of securities for fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities, where the estimated fair value

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $2.4 billion and
    $2.2 billion, respectively, of unrealized losses related to
    securities with an unrealized loss position of less than 20% of
    cost or amortized cost, which represented 2% of the cost or
    amortized cost of such securities.

At December 31, 2006, $24 million of unrealized losses
    related to securities with an unrealized loss position of 20% or
    more of cost or amortized cost, which represented 29% of the
    cost or amortized cost of such securities. Of such unrealized
    losses of $24 million, $12 million related to
    securities that were in an unrealized loss position for a period
    of less than six months. At December 31, 2005,
    $58 million of unrealized losses related to securities with
    an unrealized loss position of 20% or more of cost or amortized
    cost, which represented 24% of the cost or amortized cost of
    such securities. Of such unrealized losses of $58 million,
    $51 million related to securities that were in an
    unrealized loss position for a period of less than six months.

The Company held eight fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities each with a gross unrealized loss at
    December 31, 2006 each greater than $10 million. These
    securities represented 7%, or $169 million in the
    aggregate, of the gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities. The Company held one fixed
    maturity security with a gross unrealized loss at
    December 31, 2005 greater than $10 million. This
    security represented less than 1%, or $10 million of the
    gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity and equity securities.



At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had
    $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of gross
    unrealized loss related to its fixed maturity and equity
    securities. These securities are concentrated, calculated as a
    percentage of gross unrealized loss, as follows:

As described previously, the Company performs a regular
    evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. One of the criteria which the Company considers in its

other-than-temporary

impairment analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities
    for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of
    their value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or
    amortized cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold
    securities considers broad portfolio management objectives such
    as asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry
    segment exposures, interest rate views and the overall total
    return focus. In following these portfolio management
    objectives, changes in facts and circumstances that were present
    in past reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell
    securities that were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions
    to sell are based on current conditions or the Company’s
    need to shift the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management
    objectives including liquidity needs or duration targets on
    asset/liability managed portfolios. The Company attempts to
    anticipate these types of changes and if a sale decision has
    been made on an impaired security and that security is not
    expected to recover prior to the expected time of sale, the
    security will be deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss will be recognized.

Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of the
    securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the cause
    of the decline being principally attributable to the general
    rise in rates during the holding period, and the Company’s
    current intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity
    securities with unrealized losses for a period of time
    sufficient for them to recover, the Company has concluded that
    the aforementioned securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

The Company maintains a diversified corporate fixed maturity
    portfolio across industries and issuers. The portfolio does not
    have exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of the total
    invested assets of the portfolio. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company’s combined holdings in the ten issuers to
    which it had the greatest exposure totaled $6.8 billion and
    $6.2 billion, respectively, each less than 3% of the
    Company’s total invested assets at such dates. The exposure
    to the largest single issuer of corporate fixed maturity
    securities held at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was
    $970 million and $943 million, respectively.

The Company has hedged all of its material exposure to foreign
    currency risk in its corporate fixed maturity portfolio. In the
    Company’s international insurance operations, both its
    assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local
    currencies.

The majority of the residential mortgage-backed securities are
    guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal National
    Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
    or the Government National Mortgage Association. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, $51.0 billion and
    $46.3 billion, respectively, or 99% and 98%, respectively,
    of the residential mortgage-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA
    by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, $13.8 billion and
    $13.3 billion, respectively, or 83% and 75%, respectively,
    of the commercial mortgage-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA
    by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.

The Company’s asset-backed securities are diversified both
    by sector and by issuer. Credit card receivables and home equity
    loans, accounting for about 35% and 22% of the total holdings,
    respectively, constitute the largest exposures in the
    Company’s asset-backed securities portfolio. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, $8.0 billion and
    $6.1 billion, respectively, or 57% and 53%, respectively,
    of total asset-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.



Structured Investment Transactions.

The
    Company participates in structured investment transactions which
    enhance the Company’s total return on its investment
    portfolio principally by providing equity-based returns on debt
    securities through structured notes and similar instruments. The
    carrying value of such investments, included in fixed maturity
    securities, was $354 million and $362 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The related net
    investment income recognized was $43 million,
    $28 million and $45 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Trading
    Securities

During 2005, the Company established a trading securities
    portfolio to support investment strategies that involve the
    active and frequent purchase and sale of securities, the
    execution of short sale agreements and asset and liability
    matching strategies for certain insurance products. Trading
    securities and short sale agreement liabilities are recorded at
    fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in
    net investment income related to fixed maturity securities.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, trading securities were
    $759 million and $825 million, respectively, and
    liabilities associated with the short sale agreements in the
    trading securities portfolio, which were included in other
    liabilities, were $387 million and $460 million,
    respectively. The Company had pledged $614 million and
    $375 million of its assets, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005,
    the Company acquired Travelers’ investment in Tribeca
    Citigroup Investments Ltd. (“Tribeca”). Tribeca was a
    feeder fund investment structure whereby the feeder fund invests
    substantially all of its assets in the master fund, Tribeca
    Global Convertible Instruments Ltd. The primary investment
    objective of the master fund is to achieve enhanced
    risk-adjusted return by investing in domestic and foreign
    equities and equity-related securities utilizing such strategies
    as convertible securities arbitrage. At December 31, 2005,
    MetLife was the majority owner of the feeder fund and
    consolidated the fund within its consolidated financial
    statements. At December 31, 2005, $452 million of
    trading securities and $190 million of the short sale
    agreements were related to Tribeca. Net investment income
    related to the trading activities of Tribeca, which included
    interest and dividends earned and net realized and unrealized
    gains (losses), was $12 million and $6 million for the
    six months ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

During the second quarter of 2006, MetLife’s ownership
    interests in Tribeca declined to a position whereby Tribeca is
    no longer consolidated and, as of June 30, 2006, was
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity
    method investment at December 31, 2006 of $82 million
    was included in other limited partnership interests. Net
    investment income related to the Company’s equity method
    investment in Tribeca was $9 million for the six months
    ended December 31, 2006.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, interest
    and dividends earned on trading securities in addition to the
    net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on the
    trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities totaled $71 million and $14 million,
    respectively. Changes in the fair value of such trading
    securities and short sale agreement liabilities, totaled
    $26 million and less than a million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company did
    not have any trading securities during the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

Mortgage
    and Consumer Loans

The Company’s mortgage and consumer loans are principally
    collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential
    properties, as well as automobiles. Mortgage and consumer loans
    comprised 12.7% and 12.2% of the Company’s total cash and
    invested assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The carrying value of mortgage and consumer loans
    is stated at original cost net of repayments, amortization of
    premiums, accretion of



discounts and valuation allowances. The following table shows

Restructured, Potentially Delinquent, Delinquent or Under
    Foreclosure.

The Company monitors its mortgage loan
    investments on an ongoing basis, including reviewing loans that
    are restructured, potentially delinquent, delinquent or under
    foreclosure. These loan classifications are consistent with
    those used in industry practice.

The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in
    which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the
    debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
    debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company defines
    potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in management’s
    opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent. The
    Company defines delinquent mortgage loans, consistent with
    industry practice, as loans in which two or more interest or
    principal payments are past due. The Company defines mortgage
    loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure
    proceedings have formally commenced.

The Company reviews all mortgage loans on an ongoing basis.
    These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial
    statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property
    inspections, market analysis and tenant creditworthiness.

The Company records valuation allowances for certain of the
    loans that it deems impaired. The Company’s valuation
    allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for
    those loans where a property or market specific risk has been
    identified that could likely result in a future default, as well
    as for pools of loans with similar high risk characteristics
    where a property specific or market risk has not been
    identified. Loan specific valuation allowances are established
    for the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the
    present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the
    loan’s original effective interest rate, the value of the
    loan’s collateral, or the loan’s market value if the
    loan is being sold. Valuation allowances for pools of loans are
    established based on property types and loan to value risk
    factors. The Company records valuation allowances as investment
    losses. The Company records subsequent adjustments to allowances
    as investment gains (losses).

Agricultural Mortgage Loans.

The Company
    diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans by both geographic
    region and product type.

Approximately 60% of the $9.2 billion of agricultural
    mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2006 were
    subject to rate resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion
    of these loans has been successfully renegotiated and remains
    outstanding to maturity. The process and policies for monitoring
    the agricultural mortgage loans and classifying them by
    performance status are generally the same as those for the
    commercial loans.

Real
    Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures

The Company’s real estate and real estate joint venture
    investments consist of commercial properties located primarily
    in the United States. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    carrying value of the Company’s real estate, real estate
    joint ventures and real estate

held-for-sale

was $5.0 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively, or
    1.5% and 1.5%, of total cash and invested assets, respectively.
    The carrying value of real estate is stated at depreciated cost
    net of impairments and valuation allowances. The carrying value
    of real estate joint ventures is stated at the Company’s
    equity in the real estate joint ventures net of impairments and
    valuation allowances. The following table presents the carrying
    value of the Company’s real estate, real estate joint

recognized impairments of $8 million and $5 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The carrying value of non-



income producing real estate and real estate joint ventures was
    $8 million and $37 million at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. The Company owned real estate acquired
    in satisfaction of debt of $3 million and $4 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Company records real estate acquired upon foreclosure of
    commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at the lower of
    estimated fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan
    at the date of foreclosure.

The Company’s real estate holdings are primarily located in
    the United States. At December 31, 2006, 26%, 15% and 15%
    of the Company’s real estate holdings were located in New
    York, Texas and California, respectively.

Certain of the Company’s investments in real estate joint
    ventures meet the definition of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) under FIN No. 46,

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities — An Interpretation of
    Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51

, and its
    December 2003 revision (“FIN 46(r)”). See
    “— Variable Interest Entities.”

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company closed the sale of
    its Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties located
    in Manhattan, New York for $5.4 billion. The Peter Cooper
    Village and Stuyvesant Town properties together make up the
    largest apartment complex in Manhattan, New York totaling over
    11,000 units, spread over 80 contiguous acres. The
    properties were owned by the Holding Company’s subsidiary,
    MTL. The sale resulted in a gain of $3 billion, net of
    income tax, and is included in income from discontinued
    operations in the consolidated statements of income.

In the second quarter of 2005, the Company sold its One Madison
    Avenue and 200 Park Avenue properties in Manhattan, New York for
    $918 million and $1.72 billion, respectively,
    resulting in gains, net of income tax, of $431 million and
    $762 million, respectively, and is included in income from
    discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of
    income. In connection with the sale of the 200 Park Avenue
    property, the Company has retained rights to existing signage
    and is leasing space for associates in the property for
    20 years with optional renewal periods through 2205.

The Company’s deferred income tax liability related to

    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The rental
    receivables set forth above are generally due in periodic
    installments. The payment periods generally range from one to
    15 years, but in certain circumstances are as long as
    30 years.

Other
    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that make private equity investments in companies in the
    United States and overseas) was $4.8 billion and
    $4.3 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company uses the equity method of accounting
    for investments in limited partnership interests in which it has
    more than a minor interest, has influence over the
    partnership’s operating and financial policies, but does
    not have a controlling interest and is not the primary
    beneficiary. The Company uses the cost method for minor interest
    investments and when it has virtually no influence over the
    partnership’s operating and financial policies. The
    Company’s investments in other limited partnership
    interests represented 1.4% of cash and invested assets at both
    December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Some of the Company’s investments in other limited
    partnership interests meet the definition of a VIE under
    FIN 46(r). See “— Variable Interest
    Entities.”

Other
    Invested Assets

The Company’s other invested assets consisted principally
    of leveraged leases of $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion,
    funds withheld at interest of $4.0 billion and
    $3.5 billion, and standalone derivatives with positive fair
    values and the fair value of embedded derivatives related to
    funds withheld and modified coinsurance contracts of
    $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The leveraged leases are recorded
    net of non-recourse debt. The Company participates in lease
    transactions, which are diversified by industry, asset type and
    geographic area. The Company regularly reviews residual values
    and writes down residuals to expected values as needed. Funds
    withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by ceding
    companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For
    agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain
    agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets supporting the
    reinsured policies equal to the net statutory reserves are
    withheld and continue to be legally owned by the ceding company.
    Interest accrues to these funds withheld at rates defined by the
    treaty terms



and may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    investment portfolio. The Company’s other invested assets
    represented 3.1% and 2.6% of cash and invested assets at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including swaps,
    forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage its various
    risks. Additionally, the Company enters into income generation
    and synthetically created investment transactions as permitted
    by its insurance subsidiaries’ Derivatives Use Plans
    approved by the applicable state insurance departments.

    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company owned 2,749 and
    3,305 equity futures contracts, respectively. Market values of
    equity futures are included in financial futures in the
    preceding table. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    owned 225,000 and 213,000 equity financial forwards,
    respectively. Market values of equity financial forwards are
    included in financial forwards in the preceding table. At
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company owned 74,864,483
    and 4,720,254 equity options, respectively. Market values of
    equity options are included in options in the preceding table.

Credit Risk.

The Company may be exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally,
    the current credit exposure of the Company’s derivative
    contracts is limited to the fair value at the reporting date.
    The credit exposure of the Company’s derivative
    transactions is represented by the fair value of contracts with
    a net positive fair value at the reporting date.

The Company manages its credit risk related to

over-the-counter

derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was obligated to
    return cash collateral under its control of $428 million
    and $195 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents and the
    obligation to return it is included in payables for



collateral under securities loaned and other transactions in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company had also accepted collateral consisting of
    various securities with a fair market value of $453 million
    and $427 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, none of the collateral had been sold or repledged.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company provided
    collateral of $80 million and $4 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities in
    the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has
    exchange traded futures, which require the pledging of
    collateral. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    pledged collateral of $105 million and $89 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities.
    The counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge
    this collateral.

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in a securities lending program whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity and
    equity securities, are loaned to third parties, primarily major
    brokerage firms. The Company requires a minimum of 102% of the
    fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained
    as collateral for the loans. Securities with a cost or amortized
    cost of $43.3 billion and $32.1 billion and an
    estimated fair value of



$44.1 billion and $33.0 billion were on loan under the
    program at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or
    repledged by the transferee. The Company was liable for cash
    collateral under its control of $45.4 billion and
    $33.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Security collateral of $100 million and
    $207 million, on deposit from customers in connection with
    the securities lending transactions at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, may not be sold or repledged and is not
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

Separate
    Accounts

The Company had $144.4 billion and $127.9 billion held
    in its separate accounts, for which the Company does not bear
    investment risk, as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The Company manages each separate account’s
    assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that
    applies to that specific separate account. The Company
    establishes separate accounts on a single client and
    multi-client commingled basis in compliance with insurance laws.
    Effective with the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

on January 1, 2004, the Company reported separately, as
    assets and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts
    and liabilities of the separate accounts if:

•

such separate accounts are legally recognized;

•

assets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated
    from the Company’s general account liabilities;

•

investments are directed by the contractholder; and

•

all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder.

The Company reports separate account assets meeting such
    criteria at their fair value. Investment performance (including
    investment income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in
    unrealized gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts
    credited to contractholders of such separate accounts are offset
    within the same line in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges. Separate accounts not meeting the above criteria are
    combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the
    market risk associated with its invested assets and interest
    rate sensitive insurance contracts. It has developed an
    integrated process for managing risk, which it conducts through
    its Corporate Risk Management Department, ALM Committees and
    additional specialists at the business segment level. The
    Company has established and implemented comprehensive policies
    and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level
    to minimize the effects of potential market volatility.

The Company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate,
    equity market and foreign currency exchange risk. As a result of
    that analysis, the Company has determined that the fair value of
    its interest rate sensitive invested assets is materially
    exposed to changes in interest rates. The equity and foreign
    currency portfolios do not expose the Company to material market
    risk (as described below).

MetLife generally uses option adjusted duration to manage
    interest rate risk and the methods and assumptions used are
    generally consistent with those used by the Company in 2005. The
    Company analyzes interest rate risk using various models
    including multi-scenario cash flow projection models that
    forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting
    investments, including derivative instruments. The Company uses
    a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, equity market,
    and foreign currency exchange risk, including the use of
    derivative instruments.

Market
    Risk Exposures

The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance
    operations and investment activities. For purposes of this
    disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of
    loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity market
    prices and foreign currency exchange rates.



Interest Rates.

The Company’s exposure to
    interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of
    fixed maturity securities, as well as its interest rate
    sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities include
    U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities issued by
    government agencies, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed
    securities, all of which are mainly exposed to changes in
    medium- and long-term treasury rates. The interest rate
    sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include
    GICs and annuities, which have the same type of interest rate
    exposure (medium- and long-term treasury rates) as fixed
    maturity securities. The Company employs product design, pricing
    and asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse
    effects of interest rate movements. Product design and pricing
    strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions
    on withdrawals in some products. Asset/liability management
    strategies include the use of derivatives, the purchase of
    securities structured to protect against prepayments, prepayment
    restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent
    monitoring of the pricing of the Company’s products in
    order to better match the duration of the assets and the
    liabilities they support.

See also “Risk Factors — Changes in Market
    Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Equity Market Prices.

The Company’s
    investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity
    prices, as do certain liabilities that involve long-term
    guarantees on equity performance. It manages this risk on an
    integrated basis with other risks through its asset/liability
    management strategies. The Company also manages equity market
    price risk through industry and issuer diversification, asset
    allocation techniques and the use of derivatives.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.

The
    Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its
    holdings in

non-U.S. dollar

denominated fixed maturity securities, equity securities and
    liabilities, as well as through its investments in foreign
    subsidiaries. The principal currencies that create foreign
    currency exchange rate risk in the Company’s investment
    portfolios are the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the British
    pound. The Company mitigates its fixed maturity securities’
    foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of
    foreign currency swaps and forward contracts. Through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries, the Company is primarily
    exposed to the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Australian
    dollar, the Argentinean peso, the South Korean won, the Chilean
    peso, the Taiwanese dollar and the Japanese Yen. The Company has
    matched substantially all of its foreign currency liabilities in
    its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency
    assets, thereby reducing its risk to currency exchange rate
    fluctuation. Selectively, the Company uses U.S. dollar
    assets to support certain long duration foreign currency
    liabilities. Additionally, in some countries, local surplus is
    held entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets which
    further minimizes exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk.

Risk
    Management

Corporate Risk Management.

MetLife has
    established several financial and non-financial senior
    management committees as part of its risk management process.
    These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve
    asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate
    corporate business standards.

MetLife also has a separate Corporate Risk Management
    Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and
    reports to MetLife’s Chief Financial Officer. The Corporate
    Risk Management Department’s primary responsibilities
    consist of:

•

implementing a Board of Directors-approved corporate risk
    framework, which outlines the Company’s approach for
    managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis;

•

developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring and
    monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk
    framework;

•

establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;

•

deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and

•

reporting on a periodic basis to the Governance Committee of the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors and various financial
    and non-financial senior management committees.

Asset/Liability Management.

The Company
    actively manages its assets using an approach that balances
    quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity
    and investment return. The goals of the investment process are
    to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted investment income
    and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets
    and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis.
    The asset/liability management process is the shared
    responsibility of the Portfolio Management Unit, the Financial
    Management and Oversight Asset/Liability Management Unit, and
    the operating business segments under the supervision of the



various product line specific ALM Committees. The ALM
    Committees’ duties include reviewing and approving target
    portfolios on a periodic basis, establishing investment
    guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the
    asset/liability management process. The portfolio managers and
    asset sector specialists, who have responsibility on a

day-to-day

basis for risk management of their respective investing
    activities, implement the goals and objectives established by
    the ALM Committees.

See also “Risk Factors — Changes in Market
    Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Each of MetLife’s business segments has an asset/liability
    officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment
    department to monitor investment, product pricing, hedge
    strategy and liability management issues. MetLife establishes
    target asset portfolios for each major insurance product, which
    represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its
    liabilities within acceptable levels of risk. These strategies
    are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics, such
    as effective duration, yield curve sensitivity, convexity,
    liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.

To manage interest rate risk, the Company performs periodic
    projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the
    potential sensitivity of its securities investments and
    liabilities to interest rate movements. These projections
    involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the
    Company’s in-force business under various increasing and
    decreasing interest rate environments. Department regulations
    require that MetLife perform some of these analyses annually as
    part of MetLife’s review of the sufficiency of its
    regulatory reserves. For several of its legal entities, the
    Company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset
    portfolios for the purpose of asset/liability management and the
    allocation of investment income to product lines. For each
    segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP
    liabilities less the DAC asset and any non-invested assets
    allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess swept
    to the surplus segment. The operating segments may reflect
    differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any
    product market characteristic which may drive a distinct
    investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or
    credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities
    make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the
    investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of
    liabilities in those entities. The Company measures relative
    sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to
    changes in key assumptions utilizing Company models. These
    models reflect specific product characteristics and include
    assumptions based on current and anticipated experience
    regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting rates. In
    addition, these models include asset cash flow projections
    reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal
    payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments and defaults.

Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are
    also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and
    liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the
    duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all
    policyholder guarantees and to how the Company intends to set
    indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or
    dividends. Each operating asset segment has a duration
    constraint based on the liability duration and the investment
    objectives of that portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may
    exceed the maturity of available assets, as is the case with
    certain retirement and non-medical health products, the Company
    may support such liabilities with equity investments or curve
    mismatch strategies.

Hedging Activities.

To reduce interest rate
    risk, MetLife’s risk management strategies incorporate the
    use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall
    duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios
    to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its
    liabilities. Such instruments include financial futures,
    financial forwards, interest rate and credit default swaps,
    caps, floors and options. MetLife also uses foreign currency
    swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated
    fixed income investments. In 2004, MetLife initiated a hedging
    strategy for certain equity price risks within its liabilities
    using equity futures and options.

Risk
    Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis

The Company measures market risk related to its holdings of
    invested assets and other financial instruments, including
    certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts, based on
    changes in interest rates, equity market prices and currency
    exchange rates, utilizing a sensitivity analysis. This analysis
    estimates the potential changes in fair value, cash flows and
    earnings based on a hypothetical 10% change (increase or
    decrease) in interest rates, equity market prices and currency
    exchange rates. The Company believes that a 10% change (increase
    or decrease) in these market rates and prices is reasonably
    possible in the near-term. In performing this analysis, the
    Company used market rates at December 31, 2006 to re-price
    its invested assets and other financial instruments. The
    sensitivity



analysis separately calculated each of MetLife’s market
    risk exposures (interest rate, equity market price and foreign
    currency exchange rate) related to its trading and non-trading
    invested assets and other financial instruments. The sensitivity
    analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings
    described above. The Company modeled the impact of changes in
    market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested
    assets, earnings and cash flows as follows:

Fair Values.

The Company bases its potential
    change in fair values on an immediate change (increase or
    decrease) in:

•

the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures
    resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates;

•

the market value of its equity positions due to a 10% change
    (increase or decrease) in equity prices; and

•

the U.S. dollar equivalent balances of the Company’s
    currency exposures due to a 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    currency exchange rates.

Earnings and Cash Flows.

MetLife calculates
    the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in
    its earnings and cash flows over a one-year period based on an
    immediate 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest rates
    and equity prices. The following factors were incorporated into
    the earnings and sensitivity analyses:

•

the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities;

•

the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal
    related to mortgage-backed securities;

•

the re-estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage-backed
    securities for each 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    interest rates; and

•

the expected turnover (sales) of fixed maturity and equity
    securities, including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds.

The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed
    as predictive of the Company’s future financial
    performance. The Company cannot assure that its actual losses in
    any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the
    table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis
    include:

•

the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and
    parameters established in creating the related sensitivity
    analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages;

•

for derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on reported
    earnings may be materially different from the change in market
    values;

•

the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and
    liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and

•

the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities
    remains unchanged throughout the year.

Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not
    substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate
    risk and asset/liability management personnel. Based on its
    analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or decrease) in
    market rates and prices, MetLife has determined that such a
    change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of
    its interest rate sensitive invested assets. The equity and
    foreign currency portfolios do not expose the Company to
    material market risk.

The table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of
    the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments
    at December 31, 2006. In addition, the potential loss with
    respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the
    Company’s equity price sensitive positions at
    December 31, 2006 is set forth in the table below.

This quantitative measure of risk has increased by
    $452 million, or 8%, at December 31, 2006, from
    $5,523 million at December 31, 2005. This change was
    due to an increase of $540 million due to an increase in
    the yield curve, an increase of $550 million due to asset
    growth and $72 million of other. These increases are
    partially offset by a decrease of $140 million due to
    growth in derivative usage and a decrease of $570 million
    due to a decline in asset duration.

In addition to the analysis above, as part of its asset
    liability management program, the Company also performs an
    analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates,
    including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments.
    As of December 31, 2006, a hypothetical instantaneous 10%
    decrease in interest rates applied to the Company’s
    liabilities, insurance and associated asset portfolios would
    reduce the fair value of equity by $350 million. Management
    does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity
    strain on the Company.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board
    of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index to Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Schedules. These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans and for certain non-traditional long duration contracts
    and separate accounts as required by accounting guidance which
    the Company adopted on December 31, 2006 and
    January 1, 2004, respectively.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report, dated
    March 1, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on
    management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an
    unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Business,
    Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“Metropolitan
    Life”). MetLife, Inc. is a leading provider of insurance
    and other financial services with operations throughout the
    United States and the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia
    Pacific. Through its domestic and international subsidiaries and
    affiliates, MetLife, Inc. offers life insurance, annuities,
    automobile and homeowners insurance, retail banking and other
    financial services to individuals, as well as group insurance,
    reinsurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of (i) the Holding Company and its subsidiaries;
    (ii) partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company
    has control; and (iii) variable interest entities
    (“VIEs”) for which the Company is deemed to be the
    primary beneficiary. Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues
    and expenses are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular
    item. See Note 9. Assets, liabilities, revenues, and
    expenses of the general account for 2005 and 2004 include
    amounts related to certain separate accounts previously reported
    in separate account assets and liabilities. See “Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements.” Intercompany accounts
    and transactions have been eliminated.

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments
    in equity securities in which it has more than a 20% interest
    and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest or
    more than a minor influence over the joint ventures and
    partnership’s operations, but does not have a controlling
    interest and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses
    the cost method of accounting for real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests in which it has a minor
    equity investment and virtually no influence over the joint
    ventures and partnership’s operations.

Minority interest related to consolidated entities included in
    other liabilities was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Certain amounts in the prior year periods’ consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    2006 presentation.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”), which is more fully
    described in Note 2. The acquisition was accounted for
    using the purchase method of accounting. Travelers’ assets,
    liabilities and results of operations were included in the
    Company’s results beginning July 1, 2005. The
    accounting policies of Travelers were conformed to those of
    MetLife upon acquisition.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

i)

the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market
    values;

ii)

investment impairments;

iii)

the recognition of income on certain investments;

F-7


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

iv)

the application of the consolidation rules to certain
    investments;

v)

the fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

vi)

the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy
    acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the establishment and
    amortization of value of business acquired (“VOBA”);

vii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

viii)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

ix)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

x)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

xi)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

xii)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

A description of such critical estimates is incorporated within
    the discussion of the related accounting policies which follow.
    The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the fair value of the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying these policies, management makes
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Investments

The Company’s principal investments are in fixed maturity
    and equity securities, mortgage and consumer loans, policy
    loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships, short-term investments, and other invested assets.
    The accounting policies related to each are as follows:

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

The
    Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities are
    classified as

available-for-sale,

except for trading securities, and are reported at their
    estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on
    these securities are recorded as a separate component of other
    comprehensive income or loss, net of policyholder related
    amounts and deferred income taxes. All security transactions are
    recorded on a trade date basis. Investment gains and losses on
    sales of securities are determined on a specific identification
    basis.

Interest income on fixed maturity securities is recorded when
    earned using an effective yield method giving effect to
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends
    on equity securities are recorded when declared. These dividends
    and interest income are recorded as part of net investment
    income.

Included within fixed maturity securities are loan-backed
    securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed
    securities. Amortization of the premium or discount from the
    purchase of these securities considers the estimated timing and
    amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment
    experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are
    recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments
    originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and
    currently anticipated. Prepayment assumptions for single class
    and multi-class mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities are
    obtained from broker-dealer survey values or internal estimates.
    For credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
    and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a retrospective basis.

F-8


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    impairments in value deemed to be

other-than-temporary

in the period in which the determination is made. These
    impairments are included within net investment gains (losses)
    and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    is reduced accordingly. The Company does not change the revised
    cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on
    management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair
    value. The Company’s review of its fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value had declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market
    value has been below cost or amortized cost; (ii) the
    potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the
    potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically
    depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for
    impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or
    industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has
    exhausted natural resources; (vi) the Company’s
    ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount
    equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost (See also
    Note 3) ; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash
    flows on asset-backed securities; and (viii) other
    subjective factors, including concentrations and information
    obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The Company purchases and receives beneficial interests in
    special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio
    principally by providing equity-based returns on debt
    securities. These investments are generally made through
    structured notes and similar instruments (collectively,
    “Structured Investment Transactions”). The Company has
    not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the
    SPEs and its exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value
    of the beneficial interests in the SPEs. The Company does not
    consolidate the SPEs as it has determined it is not the primary
    beneficiary. These Structured Investment Transactions are
    included in fixed maturity securities and their income is
    generally recognized using the retrospective interest method.
    Impairments of these investments are included in net investment
    gains (losses).

Trading Securities.

The Company’s trading
    securities portfolio, principally consisting of fixed maturity
    and equity securities, supports investment strategies that
    involve the active and frequent purchase and sale of securities
    and the execution of short sale agreements and supports asset
    and liability matching strategies for certain insurance
    products. Trading securities and short sale agreement
    liabilities are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes
    in fair value recognized in net investment income. Related
    dividends and investment income are also included in net
    investment income.

Securities Lending.

Securities loaned
    transactions are treated as financing arrangements and are
    recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company obtains
    collateral in an amount equal to 102% of the fair value of the
    securities loaned. The Company monitors the market value of the
    securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral
    obtained as necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s
    securities loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms.
    Income and expenses associated with securities loaned
    transactions are reported as investment income and investment
    expense, respectively, within net investment income.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans.

Mortgage and
    consumer loans are stated at unpaid principal balance, adjusted
    for any unamortized premium or discount, deferred fees or
    expenses, net of valuation allowances. Interest income is
    accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on the
    loan’s contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums
    and discounts is recorded using the effective yield method.
    Interest income, amortization of premiums and discounts, and
    prepayment fees are reported in net investment income. Loans are
    considered to be impaired when it is probable that, based upon
    current information and events, the Company will be unable to
    collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan
    agreement. Valuation allowances are established for the excess
    carrying value of the loan over the present value of expected
    future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original
    effective interest rate, the value of the loan’s collateral
    if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise
    collateral dependent, or the loan’s market value if the
    loan is being sold. The Company also establishes allowances for
    loan losses when a loss contingency exists for pools of loans
    with similar characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on
    similar property types or loan to value risk factors. A loss
    contingency exists when the likelihood that a future event will
    occur is probable based on past events. Interest income earned
    on impaired loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan
    based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. However,
    interest ceases to be accrued for loans on which interest is
    generally more than 60 days past due

and/or

where
    the collection of interest is not considered probable. Cash
    receipts on such impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of
    the recorded investment. Gains and losses from the sale of loans
    and changes in valuation allowances are reported in net
    investment gains (losses).

Policy Loans.

Policy loans are stated at
    unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
    recorded as earned using the contractually agreed upon interest
    rate. Generally, interest is capitalized on the policy’s
    anniversary date.

Real Estate.

Real estate

held-for-investment,

including related improvements, is stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
    (typically 20 to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.
    The Company classifies a property as

held-for-sale

if it commits to a plan to sell a property within one year and
    actively markets the property in its current condition for a
    price that is reasonable in comparison to its fair value. The
    Company classifies the results of operations and the gain or
    loss on sale of a property that either has been disposed of or
    classified as

held-for-sale

as discontinued operations, if the ongoing operations of the
    property will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the
    Company and if the Company will not have any significant
    continuing involvement in the operations of the property after
    the sale. Real estate

held-for-sale

is stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value less
    expected disposition costs. Real estate is not depreciated while
    it is classified as

held-for-sale.

The Company periodically reviews its properties

held-for-investment

for impairment and tests properties for recoverability whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
    of the asset may not be recoverable and the carrying value of
    the property exceeds its fair value. Properties whose carrying
    values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows are
    written down to their fair value, with the impairment loss
    included in net investment gains (losses). Impairment losses are
    based upon the estimated fair value of real estate, which is
    generally computed using the present value of expected future
    cash flows from the real estate discounted at a rate
    commensurate with the underlying risks. Real estate acquired
    upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans
    is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the carrying
    value of the mortgage loan at the date of foreclosure.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited
    Partnership Interests.

The Company uses the
    equity method of accounting for investments in real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has
    more than a minor equity interest or more than a minor influence
    over the joint ventures and partnership’s operations, but
    does not have a controlling interest and is not the primary
    beneficiary. The Company uses the cost method of accounting for
    real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which it has a minor equity investment and
    virtually no influence over the joint ventures and the

F-10


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

partnership’s operations. In addition to the investees
    performing regular evaluations for the impairment of underlying
    investments, the Company routinely evaluates its investments in
    real estate joint ventures and limited partnerships for
    impairments. For its cost method investments it follows an
    impairment analysis which is similar to the process followed for
    its fixed maturity and equity securities as described
    previously. For equity method investees, the Company considers
    financial and other information provided by the investee, other
    known information and inherent risks in the underlying
    investments, as well as future capital commitments, in
    determining whether an impairment has occurred. When an

other-than-temporary

impairment is deemed to have occurred, the Company records a
    realized capital loss within net investment gains (losses) to
    record the investment at its fair value.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments
    include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
    less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition
    and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Other Invested Assets.

Other invested assets
    consist principally of leveraged leases and funds withheld at
    interest. The leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse
    debt. The Company participates in lease transactions which are
    diversified by industry, asset type and geographic area. The
    Company recognizes income on the leveraged leases by applying
    the leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net
    investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual
    values and impairs them to expected values as needed.

Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by
    ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. For
    agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain
    agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets supporting the
    reinsured policies, and equal to the net statutory reserves, are
    withheld and continue to be legally owned by the ceding
    companies. The Company records a funds withheld receivable
    rather than the underlying investments. The Company recognizes
    interest on funds withheld at rates defined by the treaty terms
    which may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    investment portfolio and records it in net investment income.

Other invested assets also include stand-alone derivatives with
    positive fair values and the fair value of embedded derivatives
    related to funds withheld and modified coinsurance contracts.

Estimates and Uncertainties.

The
    Company’s investments are exposed to three primary sources
    of risk: credit, interest rate and market valuation. The
    financial statement risks, stemming from such investment risks,
    are those associated with the recognition of impairments, the
    recognition of income on certain investments, and the
    determination of fair values.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments,
    as applicable, are described above by investment type. The
    determination of such allowances and impairments is highly
    subjective and is based upon the Company’s periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. Management updates it evaluations regularly
    and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations
    as such evaluations are revised.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain investment transactions,
    trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market conditions,
    which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be
    earned.

The fair values of publicly held fixed maturity securities and
    publicly held equity securities are based on quoted market
    prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However,
    in cases where quoted market prices are not available, such as
    for private fixed maturity securities, fair values are estimated
    using present value or valuation techniques. The determination
    of fair values is based on: (i) valuation methodologies;
    (ii) securities the Company deems to be comparable; and
    (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market

F-11

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

information and judgments about financial instruments, including
    estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash
    flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty.
    Factors considered in estimating fair value include: coupon
    rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking
    fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer,
    and quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Additionally, when the Company enters into certain Structured
    Investment Transactions, real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnerships for which the Company may be deemed to be
    the primary beneficiary under Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, it may
    be required to consolidate such investments. The accounting
    rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are
    complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and
    obligations associated with each party involved in the entity,
    an estimate of the entity’s expected losses and expected
    residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each
    party.

The use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the
    timing and amount of impairments, recognition of income and the
    determination of the fair value of investments may have a
    material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
    from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other
    financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or
    contracted in the

over-the-counter

market. The Company uses a variety of derivatives, including
    swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts, to manage the
    risk associated with variability in cash flows or changes in
    fair values related to the Company’s financial instruments.
    The Company also uses derivative instruments to hedge its
    currency exposure associated with net investments in certain
    foreign operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives to synthetically replicate investment risks and
    returns which are not readily available in the cash market. The
    Company also purchases certain securities, issues certain
    insurance policies and investment contracts and engages in
    certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives.

Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet either as assets within other
    invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at
    fair value as determined by quoted market prices or through the
    use of pricing models. The determination of fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on valuation
    methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under the
    circumstances. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes
    in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial
    indices, credit spreads, market volatility, and liquidity.
    Values can also be affected by changes in estimates and
    assumptions used in pricing models. Such assumptions include
    estimates of volatility, interest rates, foreign currency
    exchange rates, other financial indices and credit ratings.
    Essential to the analysis of the fair value is risk of
    counterparty default. The use of different assumptions may have
    a material effect on the estimated derivative fair value amounts
    as well as the amount of reported net income.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its
    use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting
    pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”), as amended, changes in the fair
    value of the derivative are reported in net investment gains
    (losses), in policyholder benefits and claims for economic
    hedges of liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity
    products offered by the Company or in net investment income for
    economic hedges of equity method investments in joint ventures.
    The fluctuations in fair value of derivatives which have not
    been designated for hedge accounting can result in significant
    volatility in net income.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging
    relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management
    objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction,
    as well as its designation of the hedge as either (i) a
    hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an
    unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value hedge”);
    (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the
    variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a
    recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”); or
    (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
    In this documentation, the Company sets forth how the hedging
    instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to
    the hedged item and sets forth the method that will be used to
    retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedging
    instrument’s effectiveness and the method which will be
    used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a
    hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in
    offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge
    effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically
    throughout the life of the designated hedging relationship.
    Assessments and measurement of hedge effectiveness are also
    subject to interpretation and estimation and different
    interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the
    amount reported in net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported.

Under a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the
    hedging derivative, including amounts measured as
    ineffectiveness, and changes in the fair value of the hedged
    item related to the designated risk being hedged, are reported
    within net investment gains (losses). The fair values of the
    hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals that are
    separately reported in the consolidated statement of income
    within interest income or interest expense to match the location
    of the hedged item.

Under a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the
    hedging derivative measured as effective are reported within
    other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity, and the deferred gains or losses on
    the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statement
    of income when the Company’s earnings are affected by the
    variability in cash flows of the hedged item. Changes in the
    fair value of the hedging instrument measured as ineffectiveness
    are reported within net investment gains (losses). The fair
    values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any accruals
    that are separately reported in the consolidated statement of
    income within interest income or interest expense to match the
    location of the hedged item.

In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes
    in the fair value of the hedging derivative that are measured as
    effective are reported within other comprehensive income (loss)
    consistent with the translation adjustment for the hedged net
    investment in the foreign operation. Changes in the fair value
    of the hedging instrument measured as ineffectiveness are
    reported within net investment gains (losses).

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
    (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash
    flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative expires, is
    sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer
    probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will occur;
    (iv) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the
    definition of a firm commitment; or (v) the derivative is
    de-designated as a hedging instrument.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
    that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting
    changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, the
    derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated balance
    sheet at its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized
    currently in net investment gains (losses). The carrying value
    of the hedged recognized asset or liability under a fair value
    hedge is no longer adjusted for changes in its fair value due to
    the hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying
    value is amortized

F-13


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

into income over the remaining life of the hedged item. Provided
    the hedged forecasted transaction is still probable of
    occurrence, the changes in fair value of derivatives recorded in
    other comprehensive income (loss) related to discontinued cash
    flow hedges are released into the consolidated statement of
    income when the Company’s earnings are affected by the
    variability in cash flows of the hedged item.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer
    probable that the forecasted transactions will occur by the end
    of the specified time period or the hedged item no longer meets
    the definition of a firm commitment, the derivative continues to
    be carried on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value,
    with changes in fair value recognized currently in net
    investment gains (losses). Any asset or liability associated
    with a recognized firm commitment is derecognized from the
    consolidated balance sheet, and recorded currently in net
    investment gains (losses). Deferred gains and losses of a
    derivative recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
    pursuant to the cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction are
    recognized immediately in net investment gains (losses).

In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
    discontinued, the derivative is carried at its fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheet, with changes in its fair value
    recognized in the current period as net investment gains
    (losses).

The Company is also a party to financial instruments that
    contain terms which are deemed to be embedded derivatives. The
    Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to
    determine whether it is required to be bifurcated under
    SFAS 133. If the instrument would not be accounted for in
    its entirety at fair value and it is determined that the terms
    of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related
    to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and that a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated
    from the host contract and accounted for as a freestanding
    derivative. Such embedded derivatives are carried on the
    consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the host contract
    and changes in their fair value are reported currently in net
    investment gains (losses). If the Company is unable to properly
    identify and measure an embedded derivative for separation from
    its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the balance
    sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in
    the current period in net investment gains (losses).
    Additionally, the Company may elect to carry an entire contract
    on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in fair value
    recognized in the current period in net investment gains
    (losses) if that contract contains an embedded derivative that
    requires bifurcation. There is a risk that embedded derivatives
    requiring bifurcation may not be identified and reported at fair
    value in the consolidated financial statements and that their
    related changes in fair value could materially affect reported
    net income.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
    with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less
    at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Property,
    Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer
    Software

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are
    included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using
    either the straight-line or

sum-of-the-years-digits

method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as
    appropriate. The estimated life for company occupied real estate
    property is generally 40 years. Estimated lives generally
    range from five to ten years for leasehold improvements and
    three to seven years for all other property and equipment. The
    cost basis of the property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and
    amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    was $721 million and $625 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Related depreciation and
    amortization expense was $129 million, $117 million
    and $112 million for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated
    at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software
    costs, as well as internal and external costs incurred to
    develop internal-use computer software during the application
    development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized
    generally over a four-year period using the straight-line
    method. The cost basis of computer software was
    $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
    capitalized software was $752 million and $661 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Related
    amortization expense was $112 million, $111 million
    and $139 million for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issue expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a
    life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of
    the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right
    to receive future cash flows from the business in-force at the
    acquisition date. VOBA is based on actuarially determined
    projections, by each block of business, of future policy and
    contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate
    account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment
    returns and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased
    business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC
    and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the
    related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial
    statements for reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC related to internally replaced contracts are generally
    expensed at the date of replacement.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is
    re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed

F-15


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used, and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses, and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are
    below the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting
    period, the Company also updates the actual amount of business
    remaining in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period. Returns that are higher than the Company’s
    long-term expectation produce higher account balances, which
    increases the Company’s future fee expectations and
    decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death
    benefit guarantees, resulting in higher expected future gross
    profits. The opposite result occurs when returns are lower than
    the Company’s long-term expectation. The Company’s
    practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from
    returns on separate accounts assumes that long-term appreciation
    in equity markets is not changed by short-term market
    fluctuations, but is only changed when sustained interim
    deviations are expected. The Company monitors these changes and
    only changes the assumption when its long-term expectation
    changes.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Sales
    Inducements

The Company has two different types of sales inducements which
    are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives
    a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance
    is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the
    customer’s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives
    a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than
    would have been received based on the normal general account
    interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and
    amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same
    methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
    acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment
    at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances,
    such as adverse changes in the

F-16

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

business climate, indicate that there may be justification for
    conducting an interim test. Impairment testing is performed
    using the fair value approach, which requires the use of
    estimates and judgment, at the “reporting unit” level.
    A reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one
    level below the operating segment, if discrete financial
    information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at
    that level. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing,
    goodwill within Corporate & Other is allocated to
    reporting units within the Company’s business segments. If
    the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds
    its fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment and
    recorded as a charge against net income. The fair values of the
    reporting units are determined using a market multiple, a
    discounted cash flow model, or a cost approach. The critical
    estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected
    earnings, comparative market multiples and the discount rate.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder
    Account Balances

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. Utilizing
    these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of
    business basis.

Future policy benefit liabilities for participating traditional
    life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of
    (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment
    policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture
    interest rate, ranging from 3% to 8% for domestic business and
    3% to 12% for international business, and mortality rates
    guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in
    such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal
    dividends.

Future policy benefits for non-participating traditional life
    insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of the present
    value of future benefit payments and related expenses less the
    present value of future net premiums. Assumptions as to
    mortality and persistency are based upon the Company’s
    experience when the basis of the liability is established.
    Interest rates for the aggregate future policy benefit
    liabilities range from 4% to 7% for domestic business and 2% to
    10% for international business.

Participating business represented approximately 10% and 11% of
    the Company’s life insurance in-force, and 38% and 41% of
    the number of life insurance policies in-force, at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Participating
    policies represented approximately 30% and 29%, 31% and 30%, and
    35% and 34% of gross and net life insurance premiums for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    The percentages indicated are calculated excluding the business
    of the reinsurance segment.

Future policy benefit liabilities for individual and group
    traditional fixed annuities after annuitization are equal to the
    present value of expected future payments. Interest rates used
    in establishing such liabilities range from 3% to 11% for
    domestic business and 2% to 10% for international business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-medical health
    insurance are calculated using the net level premium method and
    assumptions as to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest,
    which provide a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates
    used in establishing such liabilities range from 3% to 7% for
    domestic business and 2% to 10% for international business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest. Interest rates used in establishing such liabilities
    range from 3% to 8% for domestic business and 2% to 10% for
    international business.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon
    the Company’s historical experience and other actuarial
    assumptions that consider the effects of current developments,
    anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. With respect to property
    and casualty insurance, such unpaid claims are reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in
    such estimated liabilities are included in the results of
    operations in the period in which the changes occur.

The Company establishes future policy benefit liabilities for
    minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain
    annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating
    to certain life policies as follows:

•

Annuity guaranteed death benefit
    (“GMDB”) liabilities are determined by estimating
    the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected
    account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balance, with a related charge or credit to
    benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence suggests
    that earlier assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used
    in estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those
    used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same
    variability and risk. The assumptions of investment performance
    and volatility are consistent with the historical experience of
    the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    (“S&P”). The benefits used in calculating the
    liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a
    range of scenarios.

•

Guaranteed income benefit (“GMIB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of the income
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any
    future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and
    adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge
    or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
    evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The assumptions used for estimating the GMIB liabilities are
    consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities.
    In addition, the calculation of guaranteed annuitization benefit
    liabilities incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the
    potential annuitizations that may be elected by the
    contractholder.

•

Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees
    and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit
    to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence
    suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The
    assumptions used in estimating the secondary and paid up
    guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for
    amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and
    risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility
    for variable products are consistent with historical S&P
    experience. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are
    based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.

The Company establishes policyholder account balances
    (“PAB”) for guaranteed minimum benefit riders
    relating to certain variable annuity products as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit riders
    (“GMWB”) guarantee the contractholder a return of
    their purchase payment via partial withdrawals, even if the
    account value is reduced to zero, provided that the
    contractholder’s cumulative withdrawals in a contract year
    do not exceed a certain limit. The initial guaranteed withdrawal
    amount is equal to the initial benefit base as defined in the
    contract (typically, the initial purchase payments plus
    applicable bonus amounts). The GMWB is an embedded derivative,
    which is measured at fair value separately from the host
    variable annuity product.

F-18


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

•

Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit riders
    (“GMAB”) provide the contractholder, after a
    specified period of time determined at the time of issuance of
    the variable annuity contract, with a minimum accumulation of
    their purchase payments even if the account value is reduced to
    zero. The initial guaranteed accumulation amount is equal to the
    initial benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the
    initial purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The
    GMAB is also an embedded derivative, which is measured at fair
    value separately from the host variable annuity product.

•

For both GMWB and GMAB, the initial benefit base is increased by
    additional purchase payments made within a certain time period
    and decreases by benefits paid

and/or

withdrawal amounts. After a specified period of time, the
    benefit base may also increase as a result of an optional reset
    as defined in the contract.

•

The fair values of the GMWB and GMAB riders are calculated based
    on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the
    projected cash flows, including benefits and related contract
    charges, over the lives of the contracts, incorporating
    expectations concerning policyholder behavior. In measuring the
    fair value of GMWBs and GMABs, the Company attributes a portion
    of the fees collected from the policyholder equal to the present
    value of expected future guaranteed minimum withdrawal and
    accumulation benefits (at inception). The changes in fair value
    are reported in net investment gains (losses). Any additional
    fees represent “excess” fees and are reported in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees. These
    riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining
    markets, causing an increase in liabilities for future policy
    benefits, negatively affecting net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.

PABs relate to investment-type contracts and universal life-type
    policies. Investment-type contracts principally include
    traditional individual fixed annuities in the accumulation phase
    and non-variable group annuity contracts. PABs are equal to
    (i) policy account values, which consist of an accumulation
    of gross premium payments; (ii) credited interest, ranging
    from 0.3% to 14% for domestic business and 1% to 18% for
    international business, less expenses, mortality charges, and
    withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating to
    business combinations. Bank deposits are also included in PABs.

Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims as well as claims which have been reported but
    not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on the
    Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all claims.
    The Company derives estimates for the development of incurred
    but not reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of
    historical patterns of claims and claims development for each
    line of business. The methods used to determine these estimates
    are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from this
    continuous review process and differences between estimates and
    payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits and
    claims expense in the period in which the estimates are changed
    or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    DAC. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its group
    life and health contracts as premium received in advance and
    applies the cash received to premiums when due.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Recognition
    of Insurance Revenue and Related Benefits

Premiums related to traditional life and annuity policies with
    life contingencies are recognized as revenues when due from
    policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided
    against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated
    lives of the policies. When premiums are due over a
    significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits
    are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into
    operations in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or,
    for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit
    payments.

Premiums related to non-medical health and disability contracts
    are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract
    term.

Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type
    products are credited to PABs. Revenues from such contracts
    consist of amounts assessed against PABs for mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges and are recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the
    period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged
    to operations include interest credited and benefit claims
    incurred in excess of related PABs.

Premiums related to property and casualty contracts are
    recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of
    premium written relating to the unexpired coverage, are included
    in future policy benefits.

Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are
    presented net of reinsurance.

Other
    Revenues

Other revenues include advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions
    and fees, and administrative service fees. Such fees and
    commissions are recognized in the period in which services are
    performed. Other revenues also include changes in account value
    relating to corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”).
    Under certain COLI contracts, if the Company reports certain
    unlikely adverse results in its consolidated financial
    statements, withdrawals would not be immediately available and
    would be subject to market value adjustment, which could result
    in a reduction of the account value.

Policyholder
    Dividends

Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance
    subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of
    policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality,
    morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as
    management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of
    statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.

Income
    Taxes

The Holding Company and its includable life insurance and
    non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”). Non-includable subsidiaries file either
    separate individual corporate tax returns or separate
    consolidated tax returns.

The Company’s accounting for income taxes represents
    management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

METLIFE,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company made an
    election in 2005 under the Code’s Section 338 as it
    relates to the Travelers acquisition. As a result of this
    election, the tax basis in the acquired assets and liabilities
    was adjusted as of the acquisition date resulting in a change to
    the related deferred income tax.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not
    be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining
    whether valuation allowances should be established as well as
    the amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities (See also Note 14) or
    when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on
    deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new
    information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation
    allowances. Additionally, future events such as changes in tax
    legislation could have an impact on the provision for income tax
    and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could significantly
    affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements in the year these changes occur.

The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense
    and penalties recognized as a component of income tax.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a
    provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and
    property and casualty insurance products.

For each of its reinsurance contracts, the Company determines if
    the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability
    relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable
    accounting standards. The Company reviews all contractual
    features, particularly those that may limit the amount of
    insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features
    that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.

For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration
    contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the
    difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the
    liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts
    is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of
    the contract. The net cost of reinsurance is recorded as an
    adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component of other
    expenses on a basis consistent with the way the acquisition
    costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be recognized.
    Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the reinsurance of
    in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid (received) related to
    new business, are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) future policy benefit liabilities are established.

For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that
    meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid
    (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) unearned premiums and are reflected as a component of
    premiums and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such
    amounts are

F-21


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortized through earned premiums over the remaining contract
    period in proportion to the amount of protection provided. For
    retroactive reinsurance of short-duration contracts that meet
    the criteria of reinsurance accounting, amounts paid (received)
    in excess of (which do not exceed) the related insurance
    liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized immediately as a
    loss. Any gains on such retroactive contracts are deferred and
    recorded in other liabilities. The gains are amortized primarily
    using the recovery method.

The assumptions used to account for both long and short-duration
    reinsurance contracts are consistent with those used for the
    underlying contracts. Ceded policyholder and contract related
    liabilities, other than those currently due, are reported gross
    on the balance sheet.

Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance contracts are
    included in premiums and other receivables and amounts currently
    payable are included in other liabilities. Such assets and
    liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts with the same
    reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right
    of offset exists within the reinsurance contract.

Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include
    amounts assumed under reinsurance contracts and are net of
    reinsurance ceded.

If the Company determines that a reinsurance contract does not
    expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    contract as a deposit, net of related expenses. Deposits
    received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are
    included within other assets. As amounts are paid or received,
    consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or
    liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded
    as other revenue or other expenses, as appropriate.
    Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected
    payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or
    liability through other revenue or other expenses, as
    appropriate.

Amounts received from reinsurers for policy administration are
    reported in other revenues.

Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions
    and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of
    the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty
    credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and
    anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned
    assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to
    ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial
    strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using
    criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment
    process discussed previously.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance
    laws and are generally not chargeable with liabilities that
    arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account
    assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent
    the value of such assets exceeds the separate account
    liabilities. The Company reports separately, as assets and
    liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and
    liabilities of the separate accounts if (i) such separate
    accounts are legally recognized; (ii) assets supporting the
    contract liabilities are legally insulated from the
    Company’s general account liabilities;
    (iii) investments are directed by the contractholder; and
    (iv) all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder. The
    Company reports separate account assets meeting such criteria at
    their fair value. Investment performance (including investment
    income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized
    gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to
    contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the
    same line in the consolidated statements of income.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges. Separate accounts not meeting the above criteria are
    combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor various plans that provide
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefits
    covering eligible employees and sales representatives. A
    December 31 measurement date is used for all of the
    Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans.

Pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional
    formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula
    provides benefits based upon years of credited service and
    either final average or career average earnings. The cash
    balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which
    credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of
    eligible pay as well as earnings credits, determined annually
    based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2006, virtually all the obligations are
    calculated using the traditional formula.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, established
    the accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87,
    the projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit
    pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial
    assumptions, from which actual results may vary, as described

(“SFAS 106”), as amended, established the
    accounting for expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all other postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligations (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future other
    postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered
    through a particular date and is the valuation basis upon which
    liabilities are established. The APBO is determined using a
    variety of actuarial assumptions, from which actual results may
    vary, as described below.

Prior to December 31, 2006, the funded status of the
    pension and other postretirement plans, which is the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the PBO for pension
    plans and the APBO for other postretirement plans (collectively,
    the “Benefit Obligations”), were offset by the
    unrecognized actuarial gains or losses, prior service cost and
    transition obligations to determine prepaid or accrued benefit
    cost, as applicable. The net amount was recorded as a prepaid or
    accrued benefit cost, as applicable. Further, for pension plans,
    if the ABO exceeded the fair value of the plan assets, that
    excess was recorded as an additional minimum pension liability
    with a corresponding intangible asset. Recognition of the
    intangible asset was limited to the amount of any unrecognized
    prior service cost. Any additional minimum pension liability in
    excess of the allowable intangible asset was charged, net of
    income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income.

As described more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements”, effective December 31, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS 158”). Effective with the adoption of
    SFAS 158 on December 31, 2006, the Company recognizes
    the funded status of the Benefit Obligations for each of its
    plans on the consolidated balance sheet. The actuarial gains or
    losses, prior service costs and credits,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and the remaining net transition asset or obligation that had
    not yet been included in net periodic benefit costs as of
    December 31, 2006 are now charged, net of income tax, to
    accumulated other comprehensive income. Additionally, these
    changes eliminated the additional minimum pension liability
    provisions of SFAS 87.

Net periodic benefit cost is determined using management
    estimates and actuarial assumptions to derive service cost,
    interest cost, and expected return on plan assets for a
    particular year. Net periodic benefit cost also includes the
    applicable amortization of any prior service cost (credit)
    arising from the increase (decrease) in prior years’
    benefit costs due to plan amendments or initiation of new plans.
    These costs are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over
    the expected service years of employees whose benefits are
    affected by such plan amendments. Actual experience related to
    plan assets

and/or

the
    benefit obligations may differ from that originally assumed when
    determining net periodic benefit cost for a particular period,
    resulting in gains or losses. To the extent such aggregate gains
    or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
    obligations or the market-related asset value of the plans, they
    are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the expected
    service years of employees expected to receive benefits under
    the plans.

The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data, and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

The Subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution savings and
    investment plans (“SIP”) for substantially all
    employees under which a portion of employee contributions are
    matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll
    period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    for current matching contributions. As all contributions are
    transferred currently as earned to the SIP trust, no liability
    for matching contributions is recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Stock-based compensation grants prior to January 1, 2003
    were accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed
    by Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
    No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”), and related interpretations.
    Compensation expense, if any, was recorded based upon the excess
    of the quoted market price at grant date over the amount the
    employee was required to pay to acquire the stock. Under the
    provisions of APB 25, there was no compensation expense
    resulting from the issuance of stock options as the exercise
    price was equivalent to the fair market value at the date of
    grant. Compensation expense was recognized under the Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan (“LTPCP”), as described
    more fully in Note 17.

Stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2002 but
    prior to January 1, 2006 were accounted for on a
    prospective basis using the fair value accounting method
    prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), as
    amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS 148”). The fair value method of
    SFAS 123 required compensation expense to be measured based
    on the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant or award
    date. Stock-based compensation was accrued over the vesting
    period of the grant or award, including grants or awards to
    retirement-eligible employees. As required by SFAS 148, the
    Company discloses the pro forma impact as if the stock options
    granted prior to January 1, 2003 had been accounted for
    using the fair value provisions of SFAS 123 rather than the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25. See
    Note 17.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, using the
    modified prospective transition method, SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(r)”), which replaces SFAS 123 and
    supersedes APB 25. The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not
    have a significant impact on the Company’s financial
    position or results of operations. SFAS 123(r) requires
    that the cost of all stock-based transactions be measured at
    fair value and recognized over the period during which a grantee
    is required to provide goods or services in exchange for the
    award. Although the terms of the Company’s stock-based
    plans do not accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the
    attainment of retirement eligibility, the requisite service
    period subsequent to attaining such eligibility is considered
    nonsubstantive. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation
    expense related to stock-based awards over the shorter of the
    requisite service period or the period to attainment of
    retirement eligibility. SFAS 123(r) also requires an
    estimation of future forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    incorporated into the determination of compensation expense when
    recognizing expense over the requisite service period.

Foreign
    Currency

Balance sheet accounts of foreign operations are translated at
    the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and income and
    expense accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange
    prevailing during the year. The local currencies of foreign
    operations are the functional currencies unless the local
    economy is highly inflationary. Translation adjustments are
    charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or
    loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
    reported as net investment gains (losses) in the period in which
    they occur.

Discontinued
    Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company that
    either has been disposed of or is classified as

held-for-sale

are reported in discontinued operations if the operations and
    cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from
    the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the Company will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period. The difference between the number of shares assumed
    issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the
    dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common share include the
    dilutive effect of the assumed: (i) exercise or issuance of
    stock-based awards using the treasury stock method;
    (ii) settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying
    common equity units using the treasury stock method; and
    (iii) settlement of accelerated common stock repurchase
    contract. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance
    of stock-based awards and settlement of the stock purchase
    contracts underlying common equity units is assumed to occur
    with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average
    market price for the period. See Notes 12, 17 and 19.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    position. Liabilities are established when it is probable that a
    loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. On a quarterly and annual basis, the
    Company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities
    for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related
    contingencies to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in
    certain of the Company’s litigation and regulatory
    investigations, or the use of different assumptions in the
    determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect
    upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in
    particular quarterly or annual periods.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there is no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date. See also Summary of
    “Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates” and Note 16.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the SEC in Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based Payment

(“SAB 107”) — using the modified
    prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods have
    not been restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of
    all stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS 123 on a
    prospective basis effective January 1, 2003, and prior to
    January 1, 2003, accounted for its stock-based awards to
    employees under the intrinsic value method prescribed by
    APB 25. The Company did not modify the substantive terms of
    any existing awards prior to adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).

The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested
    prior to the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair
    value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1,
    2003. As required by SFAS 148, and carried forward in the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r), the Company

F-26


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

discloses the pro forma impact as if stock-based awards
    accounted for under APB 25 had been accounted for under the
    fair value method in Note 17.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    consolidated financial position or results of operations for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility. The pro forma
    impact of this change in expense recognition policy for
    stock-based compensation is detailed in Note 17.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has adopted guidance relating to derivative
    financial instruments as follows:

•

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS 133 and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;

(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a
    qualifying special-purpose entity (“QSPE”) from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

•

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely from the
    embedded call options in the underlying financial assets. The
    adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument through Exercise
    of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue
    B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
    Call Options That Are Exercisable Only by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies that the potential
    settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a creditor occurring
    upon exercise of a put or call option meets the net settlement
    criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39 clarifies that an embedded
    call option, in which the underlying is an interest rate or
    interest rate index, that can accelerate the settlement of a
    debt host financial instrument should not be bifurcated and fair
    valued if the right to accelerate the settlement can be
    exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower) and the investor
    will recover substantially all of its initial net investment.
    The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Other
    Pronouncements

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF

05-7”).

EITF

05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized upon the
    modification as a discount (or premium) associated with the
    debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of EITF

05-7

did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF

EITF

05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a temporary difference; and
    (ii) the establishment of the deferred tax liability for
    the basis difference should result in an adjustment to
    additional paid-in capital. EITF

    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB

impracticable. It also requires that a change in the method of
    depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived,
    non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
    estimate rather than a change in accounting principle. The
    adoption of SFAS 154 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In June 2005, the EITF reached consensus on Issue

No. 04-5,

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF

EITF

04-5

provides a framework for determining whether a general partner
    controls and should consolidate a limited partnership or a
    similar entity in light of certain rights held by the limited
    partners. The consensus also provides additional guidance on
    substantive rights. EITF

04-5

was
    effective after June 29, 2005 for all newly formed
    partnerships and for any pre-existing limited partnerships that
    modified their partnership agreements after that date. For all
    other limited partnerships, EITF

04-5

required adoption by January 1, 2006 through a cumulative
    effect of a change in accounting principle recorded in opening
    equity or applied retrospectively by adjusting prior period
    financial statements. The adoption of the provisions of EITF

04-5

did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective November 9, 2005, the Company prospectively
    adopted the guidance in FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)

No. FAS 140-2,

Clarification of the Application of Paragraphs 40(b) and
    40(c) of FAS 140

(“FSP

140-2”).

FSP 140-2

clarified certain criteria relating to derivatives and
    beneficial interests when considering whether an entity
    qualifies as a QSPE. Under FSP

140-2,

the
    criteria must only be met at the date the QSPE issues beneficial
    interests or when a derivative financial instrument needs to be
    replaced upon the occurrence of a specified event outside the
    control of the transferor. The adoption of FSP

140-2

did
    not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an
    amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 amended prior
    guidance to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of
    similar productive assets and replaced it with a general
    exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have
    commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial
    substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to
    change significantly as a result of the exchange. The provisions
    of SFAS 153 were required to be applied prospectively for
    fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption
    of SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective July 1, 2005, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-6,

EITF

05-6

provides guidance on determining the amortization period for
    leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or
    acquired subsequent to lease inception. As required by EITF

05-6,

the
    Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis which had
    no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2005, the FASB completed its review of EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF

03-1”).

EITF

03-1

provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when
    an impairment of debt and marketable equity securities and
    investments accounted for under the cost method should be
    considered

other-than-temporary

and recognized in income. EITF

03-1

also
    requires certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures for
    debt and marketable equity securities classified as

available-for-sale

or

held-to-maturity

under SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain
    Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

, that are impaired
    at the balance sheet date but for which an

other-than-temporary

impairment has not been recognized. The FASB decided not to
    provide additional guidance on the meaning of

other-than-temporary

impairment but has issued FSP Nos.

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments

(“FSP

115-1”),

which nullifies the accounting guidance on the determination of
    whether an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired as set forth in EITF

03-1.

As
    required by FSP

115-1,

the
    Company adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, which had
    no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, and has provided the required disclosures.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings
    Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of

(“FSP

109-2”).

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“AJCA”)
    introduced a one-time dividend received deduction on the
    repatriation of certain earnings to a U.S. taxpayer. FSP

109-2

provides companies additional time beyond the financial
    reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the
    AJCA on their plans to repatriate foreign earnings for purposes
    of applying SFAS No. 109,

Accounting for Income
    Taxes.

During 2005, the Company recorded a
    $27 million income tax benefit related to the repatriation
    of foreign earnings pursuant to Internal Revenue Code
    Section 965 for which a U.S. deferred income tax
    provision had previously been recorded. As of January 1,
    2006, the repatriation provision of the AJCA no longer applies
    to the Company.

Effective July 1, 2004, the Company prospectively adopted
    FSP

No. FAS 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of

(“FSP 106-2”).

FSP

106-2

provides accounting guidance to employers that sponsor
    postretirement health care plans that provide prescription drug
    benefits. The Company began receiving subsidies on prescription
    drug benefits during 2006 under the Medicare Prescription Drug,
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
    “Prescription Drug Act”) based on the Company’s
    determination that the prescription drug benefits offered under
    certain postretirement plans are actuarially equivalent to the
    benefits offered under Medicare Part D. The postretirement
    benefit plan assets and accumulated benefit obligation were
    remeasured to determine the effect of the expected subsidies on
    net periodic postretirement benefit cost. As a result, the
    accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was reduced by
    $213 million at July 1, 2004. See also Note 16.

Effective July 1, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 03-16,

Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies

(“EITF

03-16”).

EITF

03-16

provides guidance regarding whether a limited liability company
    should be viewed as similar to a corporation or similar to a
    partnership for purposes of determining whether a noncontrolling
    investment should be accounted for using the cost method or the
    equity method of accounting.

EITF 03-16

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective April 1, 2004, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 03-6,

Participating Securities and the Two —
    Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128

(“EITF

03-6”).

EITF

03-6

provides guidance on determining whether a security should be
    considered a participating security for purposes of computing
    earnings per common share and how earnings should be allocated
    to the participating security. EITF

03-6

did not
    have an impact on the Company’s earnings per common share
    calculations or amounts.

Effective January 1, 2004, the Company adopted Statement of
    Position (“SOP”)

03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
    Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

(“SOP 03-1”),

as interpreted by a Technical Practice Aid (“TPA”),
    issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) and FSP

No. FAS 97-1,

Situations in Which Paragraphs 17(b) and 20 of FASB
    Statement No 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments, Permit or Require
    Accrual of an Unearned Revenue Liability.

SOP 03-1

provides guidance on: (i) the classification and valuation
    of long-duration contract liabilities; (ii) the accounting
    for sales inducements; and (iii) separate account
    presentation and valuation. As a result of the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

effective January 1, 2004, the Company decreased the
    liability for future policyholder benefits for changes in the
    methodology relating to various guaranteed death and
    annuitization benefits and for determining liabilities for
    certain universal life insurance contracts by $4 million,
    which was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in
    accounting. This amount is net of corresponding changes in DAC,
    including VOBA and unearned revenue liability, under certain
    variable annuity and life contracts and income tax. Certain
    other contracts sold by the Company provide for a return through
    periodic crediting rates, surrender adjustments or termination
    adjustments based on the total return of a contractually
    referenced pool of assets owned by the Company. To the extent
    that such contracts are not accounted for as derivatives under
    the provisions of SFAS 133 and not already credited to the
    contract account balance, under

SOP 03-1

the change relating to the fair value of the referenced pool of
    assets is recorded as a liability with the change in the
    liability recorded as policyholder benefits

F-30


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and claims. Prior to the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the Company recorded the change in such liability as other
    comprehensive income. At adoption, this change decreased net
    income and increased other comprehensive income by
    $63 million, net of income tax, which were recorded as
    cumulative effects of changes in accounting. Effective with the
    adoption of

SOP 03-1,

costs associated with enhanced or bonus crediting rates to
    contractholders must be deferred and amortized over the life of
    the related contract using assumptions consistent with the
    amortization of DAC. Since the Company followed a similar
    approach prior to adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the provisions of

SOP 03-1

relating to sales inducements had no significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. In accordance
    with

SOP 03-1’s

guidance for the reporting of certain separate accounts, at
    adoption, the Company also reclassified $1.7 billion of
    separate account assets to general account investments and
    $1.7 billion of separate account liabilities to future
    policy benefits and PABs. This reclassification decreased net
    income and increased other comprehensive income by
    $27 million, net of income tax, which were reported as
    cumulative effects of changes in accounting. As a result of the
    adoption of

SOP 03-1,

the Company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in
    accounting of $86 million, net of income tax of
    $46 million, for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

the
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits all
    entities the option to measure most financial instruments and
    certain other items at fair value at specified election dates
    and to report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings.
    The fair value option will generally be applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is generally an irrevocable election. SFAS 159 is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The Company is evaluating which eligible financial
    instruments, if any, it will elect to account for at fair value
    under SFAS 159 and the related impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In December 2006, the FASB issued FSP EITF

00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP EITF

00-19-2”).

FSP EITF

00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies.

FSP EITF

00-19-2

is
    effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and
    the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are
    entered into or modified subsequent to December 21, 2006.
    For registration payment arrangements and financial instruments
    subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to
    December 21, 2006, the guidance in the FSP is effective for
    fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company
    does not expect

FSP EITF 00-19-2

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in GAAP and requires enhanced disclosures
    about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require
    any new fair value measurements. The pronouncement is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The
    guidance in SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively with the
    exception of: (i) block discounts of financial instruments;
    and (ii) certain financial and hybrid instruments measured
    at initial recognition under SFAS 133 which is to be
    applied retrospectively as of the beginning of initial adoption
    (a limited form of retrospective application). The Company is
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157 on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. Implementation
    of SFAS 157 will require additional disclosures in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP

13-2”).

FSP

13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition, FSP

13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The guidance in

F-31


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

FSP

13-2

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2006. The Company does not expect FSP

13-2

to have
    a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
    accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in a
    company’s financial statements. FIN 48 requires
    companies to determine whether it is “more likely than
    not” that a tax position will be sustained upon examination
    by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
    benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also
    provides guidance on the recognition, measurement and
    classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any
    related interest and penalties. Previously recorded income tax
    benefits that no longer meet this standard are required to be
    charged to earnings in the period that such determination is
    made. FIN 48 will also require significant additional
    disclosures. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning
    after December 15, 2006. Based upon the Company’s
    evaluation work completed to date, the Company expects to
    recognize a reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of
    retained earnings of between $35 million and
    $60 million.

In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets — an
    amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other requirements,
    SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset
    or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to
    service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract
    in certain situations. SFAS 156 will be applied
    prospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect
    SFAS 156 to have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

In September 2005, the AICPA issued

SOP 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”).

SOP 05-1

provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises for DAC
    on internal replacements of insurance and investment contracts
    other than those specifically described in
    SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement as a modification in product
    benefits, features, rights, or coverages that occurs by the
    exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment,
    endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by the election of a
    feature or coverage within a contract. It is effective for
    internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006.

In addition, in February 2007 related TPAs were issued by the
    AICPA to provide further clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs are effective concurrently with the adoption of the
    SOP. Based on the Company’s interpretation of

SOP 05-1

and related TPAs, the adoption of

SOP 05-1

will result in a reduction to DAC and VOBA relating primarily to
    the Company’s group life and health insurance contracts
    that contain certain rate reset provisions. The Company
    estimates that the adoption of

SOP 05-1

as of January 1, 2007 will result in a cumulative effect
    adjustment of between $275 million and $310 million,
    net of income tax, which will be recorded as a reduction to
    retained earnings. In addition, the Company estimates that
    accelerated DAC and VOBA amortization will reduce 2007 net
    income by approximately $25 million to $35 million,
    net of income tax.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Travelers

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of Travelers for $12.1 billion. The results of
    Travelers’ operations were included in the Company’s
    financial statements beginning July 1, 2005. As a result of
    the acquisition, management of the Company increased
    significantly the size and scale of the Company’s core
    insurance and annuity products and expanded the Company’s
    presence in both the retirement & savings’
    domestic and international markets. The distribution agreements
    executed with Citigroup as part of the acquisition provide the
    Company with one of the broadest distribution networks in the
    industry. The initial consideration paid by the Holding Company
    for the acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Holding

F-32


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company’s common stock with a market value of
    $1.0 billion to Citigroup and $100 million in other
    transaction costs. As described more fully below, additional
    consideration of $115 million was paid by the Holding
    Company to Citigroup in 2006. In addition to cash on-hand, the
    purchase price was financed through the issuance of common stock
    as described above, debt securities as described in
    Note 10, common equity units as described in Note 12
    and preferred stock as described in Note 17.

The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of
    accounting, which requires that the assets and liabilities of
    Travelers be measured at their fair values as of July 1,
    2005.

Final
    Purchase Price Allocation and Goodwill

The purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed using management’s best estimate of
    their fair values as of the acquisition date. The computation of
    the purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price to
    the net assets acquired based upon their respective fair values
    as of July 1, 2005, and the resulting goodwill, as revised,
    are presented below.

The Company revised the purchase price as a result of the
    finalization by both parties of their review of the
    June 30, 2005 financial statements and final resolution as
    to the interpretation of the provisions of the acquisition
    agreement which resulted in a payment of additional
    consideration of $115 million by the Company to Citigroup.
    Further consideration paid to Citigroup of $115 million, as
    well as additional transaction costs of $3 million, offset
    by a $4 million reduction in restructuring costs, resulted
    in a total increase in the purchase price of $114 million.

The purchase price allocation was updated as a result of the
    additional consideration of $114 million, an increase of
    $20 million in the value of the future policy benefit
    liabilities and other policyholder funds acquired resulting from
    the finalization of the evaluation of the Travelers’
    underwriting criteria, an increase in equity securities of
    $24 million resulting from the finalization of the
    determination of the fair value of such securities, a decrease
    in current income tax payables of $21 million resulting
    from a decree by the Argentine Government regarding the
    taxability of pesification-related gains, a decrease in other
    assets and an increase in other liabilities of $1 million
    and $4 million, respectively, due to the receipt of
    additional information and the reduction in restructuring costs,
    and the net impact of aforementioned adjustments increasing
    deferred income tax assets by $1 million. Goodwill
    increased by $93 million as a consequence of such revisions
    to the purchase price and the purchase price allocation.

contracts in force at the acquisition date. VOBA is based on
    actuarially determined projections, by each block of business,
    of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and
    morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating
    expenses, investment returns and other factors. Actual
    experience on the purchased business may vary from these
    projections. If estimated gross profits or premiums differ from
    expectations, the amortization of VOBA is adjusted to reflect
    actual experience.

The value of the other identifiable intangibles reflects the
    estimated fair value of Citigroup/Travelers distribution
    agreement and customer relationships acquired at July 1,
    2005 and will be amortized in relation to the expected economic
    benefits of the agreement. If actual experience under the
    distribution agreements or with customer relationships differs
    from expectations, the amortization of these intangibles will be
    adjusted to reflect actual experience.

The use of discount rates was necessary to establish the fair
    value of VOBA, as well as the other identifiable intangible
    assets. In selecting the appropriate discount rates, management
    considered its weighted average cost of capital, as well as the
    weighted average cost of capital required by market
    participants. A discount rate of 11.5% was used to value these
    intangible assets.

Restructuring
    Costs and Other Charges

As part of the integration of Travelers’ operations,
    management approved and initiated plans to reduce approximately
    1,000 domestic and international Travelers positions, which was
    completed in December 2006. MetLife initially recorded
    restructuring costs, including severance, relocation and
    outplacement services of Travelers’ employees, as
    liabilities assumed in the purchase business combination of
    $49 million. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the liability for restructuring costs was reduced by
    $4 million and $1 million, respectively, due to a
    reduction in the estimate of severance benefits to be paid to
    Travelers employees. The restructuring costs associated with the
    Travelers acquisition were as follows:

As described more fully in Note 1, the Company performs a
    regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are

other-than-temporarily

impaired. One of the criteria which the Company considers in its

other-than-temporary

impairment analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities
    for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of
    their value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or
    amortized cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold
    securities considers broad portfolio management objectives such
    as asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry
    segment exposures, interest rate views and the overall total
    return focus. In following these portfolio management
    objectives, changes in facts and circumstances that were present
    in past reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell
    securities that were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions
    to sell are based on current conditions or the Company’s
    need to shift the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management
    objectives including liquidity needs or duration targets on
    asset/liability managed portfolios. The Company attempts to
    anticipate these types of changes and if a sale decision has
    been made on an impaired security and that security is not
    expected to recover prior to the expected time of sale, the
    security will be deemed

other-than-temporarily

impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an

other-than-temporary

impairment loss will be recognized.

Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of the
    securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the cause
    of the decline being principally attributable to the general
    rise in rates during the holding period, and the Company’s
    current intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity
    securities with unrealized losses for a period of time
    sufficient for them to recover, the Company has concluded that
    the aforementioned securities are not

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in a securities lending program whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity and
    equity securities, are loaned to third parties, primarily major
    brokerage firms. The Company

requires a minimum of 102% of the fair value of the loaned
    securities to be separately maintained as collateral for the
    loans. Securities with a cost or amortized cost of
    $43.3 billion and $32.1 billion and an estimated fair
    value of $44.1 billion and $33.0 billion were on loan
    under the program at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Securities loaned under such transactions may be
    sold or repledged by the transferee. The Company was liable for
    cash collateral under its control of $45.4 billion and
    $33.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Security collateral of $100 million and
    $207 million on deposit from customers in connection with
    the securities lending transactions at December 31, 2006
    and 2005, respectively, may not be sold or repledged and is not
    reflected in the consolidated financial statements.

The Company had investment assets on deposit with regulatory
    agencies with a fair market value of $1.3 billion and
    $1.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,

The Company periodically disposes of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss. Generally, such losses are insignificant
    in amount or in relation to the cost basis of the investment,
    are attributable to declines in fair value occurring in the
    period of the disposition or are as a result of
    management’s decision to sell securities based on current
    conditions or the Company’s need to shift the portfolio to
    maintain its portfolio management objectives.

Losses from fixed maturity and equity securities deemed

other-than-temporarily

Trading
    Securities

During 2005, the Company established a trading securities
    portfolio to support investment strategies that involve the
    active and frequent purchase and sale of securities, the
    execution of short sale agreements and asset and liability
    matching strategies for certain insurance products. Trading
    securities and short sale agreement liabilities

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

are recorded at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value
    recognized in net investment income related to fixed maturity
    securities.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, trading securities were
    $759 million and $825 million, respectively, and
    liabilities associated with the short sale agreements in the
    trading securities portfolio, which were included in other
    liabilities, were $387 million and $460 million,
    respectively. The Company had pledged $614 million and
    $375 million of its assets, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

As part of the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005,
    the Company acquired Travelers’ investment in Tribeca
    Citigroup Investments Ltd. (“Tribeca”). Tribeca was a
    feeder fund investment structure whereby the feeder fund invests
    substantially all of its assets in the master fund, Tribeca
    Global Convertible Instruments Ltd. The primary investment
    objective of the master fund is to achieve enhanced
    risk-adjusted return by investing in domestic and foreign
    equities and equity-related securities utilizing such strategies
    as convertible securities arbitrage. At December 31, 2005,
    MetLife was the majority owner of the feeder fund and
    consolidated the fund within its consolidated financial
    statements. At December 31, 2005, $452 million of
    trading securities and $190 million of the short sale
    agreements were related to Tribeca. Net investment income
    related to the trading activities of Tribeca, which included
    interest and dividends earned and net realized and unrealized
    gains (losses), was $12 million and $6 million for the
    six months ended June 30, 2006 and the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

During the second quarter of 2006, MetLife’s ownership
    interests in Tribeca declined to a position whereby Tribeca is
    no longer consolidated and, as of June 30, 2006, was
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity
    method investment at December 31, 2006 of $82 million
    was included in other limited partnership interests. Net
    investment income related to the Company’s equity method
    investment in Tribeca was $9 million for the
    six months ended December 31, 2006.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, interest
    and dividends earned on trading securities in addition to the
    net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on the
    trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities totaled $71 million and $14 million,
    respectively. Changes in the fair value of such trading
    securities and short sale agreement liabilities, totaled
    $26 million and less than a million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company did
    not have any trading securities during the year ended
    December 31, 2004.

Structured
    Investment Transactions

The Company invests in structured notes and similar type
    instruments, which generally provide equity-based returns on
    debt securities. The carrying value of such investments,
    included in fixed maturity securities, was $354 million and
    $362 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The related net investment income recognized was
    $43 million, $28 million and $45 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce
    market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter
    interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets
    and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an interest rate swap,
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate
    interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed
    notional principal amount. These transactions are entered into
    pursuant to master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by the counterparty at each due date.

The Company also enters into basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows from assets and related liabilities. In a basis swap,
    both legs of the swap are floating with each based on a
    different index. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset
    of the contract and no principal payments are made by either
    party. A single net payment is usually made by one counterparty
    at each due date. Basis swaps are included in interest rate
    swaps in the preceding table.

Interest rate caps and floors are used by the Company primarily
    to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in
    interest rates above a specified level, and against interest
    rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and
    liabilities (duration mismatches), as well as to protect its
    minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest
    rates below a specified level, respectively.

In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) and equity
    futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a
    specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined
    by the different classes of interest rate and equity securities,
    and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal
    to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts.
    The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.

Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are
    used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of
    assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported
    by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities
    the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, and to hedge against
    changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by
    replicating Treasury or swap curve performance. The value of
    interest rate futures is substantially impacted by changes in
    interest rates and they can be used to modify or hedge existing
    interest rate risk.

F-54


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge
    liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company.

Foreign currency derivatives, including foreign currency swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and currency option contracts, are
    used by the Company to reduce the risk from fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also
    uses foreign currency forwards and swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency risk associated with certain of its net investments in
    foreign operations.

In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the
    difference between one currency and another at a forward
    exchange rate calculated by reference to an agreed upon
    principal amount. The principal amount of each currency is
    exchanged at the inception and termination of the currency swap
    by each party.

In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees
    with another party to deliver a specified amount of an
    identified currency at a specified future date. The price is
    agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a
    contract is made in a different currency at the specified future
    date.

The Company enters into currency option contracts that give it
    the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency
    amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a
    limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be
    net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign
    exchange rate and the strike price. Currency option contracts
    are included in options in the preceding table.

Swaptions are used by the Company primarily to sell, or
    monetize, embedded call options in its fixed rate liabilities. A
    swaption is an option to enter into a swap with an effective
    date equal to the exercise date of the embedded call and a
    maturity date equal to the maturity date of the underlying
    liability. The Company receives a premium for entering into the
    swaption. Swaptions are included in options in the preceding
    table.

Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in
    equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the
    equity index within a limited time at a contracted price. The
    contracts will be net settled in cash based on differentials in
    the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price. Equity
    index options are included in options in the preceding table.

The Company enters into financial forwards to buy and sell
    securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract
    and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
    date.

Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company
    agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future,
    based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period.
    Equity variance swaps are included in financial forwards in the
    preceding table.

Swap spread locks are used by the Company to hedge invested
    assets on an economic basis against the risk of changes in
    credit spreads. Swap spread locks are forward starting swaps
    where the Company agrees to pay a coupon based on a
    predetermined reference swap spread in exchange for receiving a
    coupon based on a floating rate. The Company has the option to
    cash settle with the counterparty in lieu of maintaining the
    swap after the effective date. Swap spread locks are included in
    financial forwards in the preceding table.

Certain credit default swaps are used by the Company to hedge
    against credit-related changes in the value of its investments
    and to diversify its credit risk exposure in certain portfolios.
    In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party, at specified intervals, to pay a premium to
    insure credit risk. If a credit event, as defined by the
    contract, occurs, generally the contract will require the swap
    to be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the
    referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional in
    exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty
    equal to the par value of the investment surrendered.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Credit default swaps are also used to synthetically create
    investments that are either more expensive to acquire or
    otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions
    are a combination of a derivative and usually a
    U.S. Treasury or Agency security.

A synthetic guaranteed interest contract (“GIC”) is a
    contract that simulates the performance of a traditional GIC
    through the use of financial instruments. Under a synthetic GIC,
    the policyholder owns the underlying assets. The Company
    guarantees a rate return on those assets for a premium.

Total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”) are swaps whereby
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward
    of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference
    to an agreed notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at
    the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the
    life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that
    provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty
    at each due date. TRRs can be used as hedges or to synthetically
    create investments and are included in the other classification
    in the preceding table.

    forwards to buy and sell securities.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company
    recognized no net investment gains (losses) as the ineffective
    portion of all cash flow hedges. For the years ended
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company recognized net
    investment gains (losses) of ($25) million and
    ($45) million, respectively, which represent the
    ineffective portion of all cash flow hedges. All components of
    each derivative’s gain or loss were included in the
    assessment of hedge ineffectiveness. In certain instances, the
    Company discontinued cash flow hedge accounting because the
    forecasted transactions did not occur on the anticipated date or
    in the additional time period permitted by SFAS 133. The
    net amounts reclassified into net investment gains (losses) for
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 related to
    such discontinued cash flow hedges were $3 million,
    $42 million and $51 million, respectively. There were
    no hedged forecasted transactions, other than the receipt or
    payment of variable interest payments for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

Hedges
    of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency
    swaps, options and non-derivative financial instruments to hedge
    portions of its net investments in foreign operations against
    adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures
    ineffectiveness on the forward exchange contracts based upon the
    change in forward rates. There was no ineffectiveness recorded
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The Company’s consolidated statements of stockholders’
    equity for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004
    include gains (losses) of ($17) million, ($115) million and
    ($47) million, respectively, related to foreign currency
    contracts and non-derivative financial instruments used to hedge
    its net investments in foreign operations. At December 31,
    2006 and 2005, the cumulative foreign currency translation loss
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
    these hedges was $189 million and $172 million,
    respectively. When net investments in foreign operations are
    sold or substantially liquidated, the amounts in accumulated
    other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated
    statements of income, while a pro rata portion will be
    reclassified upon partial sale of the net investments in foreign
    operations.

Non-qualifying
    Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than
    Hedging

The Company enters into the following derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 or for purposes
    other than hedging: (i) interest rate swaps, purchased caps
    and floors, and interest rate futures to economically hedge its
    exposure to interest rate volatility; (ii) foreign currency
    forwards, swaps and option contracts to economically hedge its
    exposure to adverse movements in exchange rates;
    (iii) swaptions to sell embedded call options in fixed rate
    liabilities; (iv) credit default swaps to minimize its
    exposure to adverse movements in credit; (v) credit default
    swaps to diversify credit risk exposure to certain portfolios;
    (vi) equity futures, equity index options, interest rate
    futures and equity variance swaps to economically hedge
    liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products;
    (vii) swap spread locks to economically hedge invested
    assets against the risk of changes in credit spreads;
    (viii) financial forwards to buy and sell securities;
    (ix) GICs to synthetically create traditional GICs;
    (x) credit default swaps and TRRs to synthetically create
    investments; and (xi) basis swaps to better match the cash
    flows of assets and related liabilities.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
    Company recognized as net investment gains (losses), excluding
    embedded derivatives, changes in fair value of
    ($685) million, $299 million and ($194) million,
    respectively, related to derivatives that do not qualify for
    hedge accounting. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company recorded changes in fair value of
    ($33) million and $2 million, respectively, as
    policyholder benefits and claims related to derivatives that do
    not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company did not have
    policyholder benefits and claims related to such derivatives for
    the year ended December 31, 2004. For the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded changes in
    fair value of ($40) million and ($38) million,
    respectively, as net investment income related to economic
    hedges of equity method investments in joint ventures that do
    not qualify for hedge accounting. The Company had no economic
    hedges of equity method investment in joint ventures for the
    year ended December 31, 2004.

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company has certain embedded derivatives which are required
    to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as
    derivatives. These host contracts include guaranteed minimum
    withdrawal contracts, guaranteed minimum accumulation contracts
    and modified coinsurance contracts. The fair value of the
    Company’s embedded derivative assets was $184 million
    and $50 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The fair value of the Company’s embedded
    derivative liabilities was $84 million and $45 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The amounts
    recorded and included in net investment gains (losses) during
    the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 were gains
    (losses) of $209 million, $69 million and
    $37 million, respectively.

Credit
    Risk

The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event
    of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
    instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the
    Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the fair value
    at the reporting date. The credit exposure of the Company’s
    derivative transactions is represented by the fair value of
    contracts with a net positive fair value at the reporting date.

The Company manages its credit risk related to

over-the-counter

derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was obligated to
    return cash collateral under its control of $428 million
    and $195 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents and the
    obligation to return it is included in payables for collateral
    under securities loaned and other transactions in the
    consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company had also accepted collateral consisting of
    various securities with a fair market value of $453 million
    and $427 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, none of the collateral had been sold or repledged.

As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company provided
    collateral of $80 million and $4 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities in
    the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company has
    exchange traded futures, which require the pledging of
    collateral. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company
    pledged collateral of $105 million and $89 million,
    respectively, which is included in fixed maturity securities.
    The counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge
    this collateral.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories
    of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling
    $127.9 billion and $111.2 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, for which the policyholder assumes
    all investment risk, and separate accounts with a minimum return
    or account value for which the Company contractually guarantees
    either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder
    which totaled $16.5 billion and $16.7 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The latter
    category consisted primarily of Met Managed GICs and
    participating close-out contracts. The average interest rate
    credited on these contracts were 5.1% at both December 31,
    2006 and 2005.

Fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company (including
    mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender
    charges) are reflected in the Company’s revenues as
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and
    totaled $2.4 billion, $1.7 billion and
    $1.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

Obligations
    Under Guaranteed Interest Contract Program

The Company issues fixed and floating rate obligations under its
    GIC program which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or
    foreign currencies. During the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company issued $5.2 billion,
    $4.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively, and
    repaid $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion and
    $150 million, respectively, of GICs under this program. In
    addition, the acquisition of Travelers increased the balance by
    $5.3 billion in GICs as of December 31, 2005.
    Accordingly, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, GICs
    outstanding, which are included in policyholder account

As a result of changes in estimates of insured events in the
    prior years, the claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased
    by $329 million in 2006 due to a reduction in prior year
    automobile bodily injury and homeowners’ severity, reduced
    loss adjustment expenses, improved loss ratio liabilities for
    non-medical health claim liabilities and improved claim
    management.

In 2005, the claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased by
    $180 million due to a reduction in prior year automobile
    bodily injury and homeowners’ severity as well as
    refinement in the estimation methodology for non-medical health
    long-term care claim liabilities.

In 2004, the claims and claim adjustment expenses decreased by
    $29 million due to a decrease in property and casualty
    prior year unallocated expense liabilities and improved loss
    ratios in non-medical health long-term care.

Guarantees

The Company issues annuity contracts which may include
    contractual guarantees to the contractholder for:
    (i) return of no less than total deposits made to the
    contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
    deposits”); and (ii) the highest contract value on a
    specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following the
    contract anniversary, or total deposits made to the contract
    less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
    (“anniversary contract value” or “minimum
    return”). The Company also issues annuity contracts that
    apply a lower rate of funds deposited if the contractholder
    elects to surrender the contract for cash and a higher rate if
    the contractholder elects to annuitize (“two tier
    annuities”). These guarantees include benefits that are
    payable in the event of death or at annuitization.

Reinsurance

The Company’s life insurance operations participate in
    reinsurance activities in order to limit losses, minimize
    exposure to large risks, and provide additional capacity for
    future growth. The Company has historically reinsured the
    mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies
    primarily on an excess of retention basis or a quota share
    basis. Until 2005, the Company reinsured up to 90% of the
    mortality risk for all new individual life insurance policies
    that it wrote through its various franchises. This practice was
    initiated by the different franchises for different products
    starting at various points in time between 1992 and 2000. During
    2005, the Company changed its retention practices for certain
    individual life insurance. Amounts reinsured in prior years
    remain reinsured under the original reinsurance; however, under
    the new retention guidelines, the Company reinsures up to 90% of
    the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most new
    individual life insurance policies that it writes through its
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention limits remained unchanged. On a case by case basis,
    the Company may retain up to $25 million per life on single
    life individual policies and $30 million per life on
    survivorship individual policies and reinsure 100% of amounts in
    excess of the Company’s retention limits. The Company
    evaluates its reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or
    decrease its retention at any time. In

addition, the Company reinsures a significant portion of the
    mortality risk on its individual universal life policies issued
    since 1983. Placement of reinsurance is done primarily on an
    automatic basis and also on a facultative basis for risks with
    specific characteristics.

In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, the
    Company reinsures other risks, as well as specific coverages.
    The Company routinely reinsures certain classes of risks in
    order to limit its exposure to particular travel, avocation and
    lifestyle hazards. The Company has exposure to catastrophes,
    which could contribute to significant fluctuations in the
    Company’s results of operations. The Company uses excess of
    retention and quota share reinsurance arrangements to provide
    greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure to larger
    risks.

The Company had also protected itself through the purchase of
    combination risk coverage. This reinsurance coverage pooled
    risks from several lines of business and included individual and
    group life claims in excess of $2 million per policy, as
    well as excess property and casualty losses, among others. This
    combination risk coverage was commuted during 2005.

The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group
    of reinsurers. No single unaffiliated reinsurer has a material
    obligation to the Company nor is the Company’s business
    substantially dependent upon any reinsurance contracts. The
    Company is contingently liable with respect to ceded reinsurance
    should any reinsurer be unable to meet its obligations under
    these agreements.

In the Reinsurance Segment, Reinsurance Group of America,
    Incorporated (“RGA”) retains a maximum of
    $6 million of coverage per individual life with respect to
    its assumed reinsurance business.

The amounts in the consolidated statements of income are
    presented net of reinsurance ceded. Information regarding the
    effect of reinsurance is as follows:

Closed
    Block

On April 7, 2000 (the “Demutualization Date”),
    Metropolitan Life converted from a mutual life insurance company
    to a stock life insurance company and became a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an
    order by the New York Superintendent of Insurance (the
    “Superintendent”) approving Metropolitan Life’s
    plan of reorganization, as amended (the “Plan”). On
    the Demutualization Date, Metropolitan Life established a closed
    block for the benefit of holders of certain individual life
    insurance policies of Metropolitan Life. Assets have been
    allocated to the closed block in an amount that has been
    determined to produce cash flows which, together with
    anticipated revenues from the policies included in the closed
    block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support
    obligations and liabilities relating to these policies,
    including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of
    claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the
    continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999,
    if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and
    for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and
    projected experience against the experience assumed in the
    then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted
    periodically to give effect to changes in experience.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies
    in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows
    from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and
    other experience related to the closed block are, in the
    aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the
    closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed
    block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less
    than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
    policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts
    assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed
    block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
    If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed
    policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets
    outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in
    effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains
    in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over
    100 years.

The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for
    the participating policies included in the closed block as it
    used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company
    establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that
    will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as
    described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over
    closed block assets at the effective date of the demutualization
    (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in
    accumulated other comprehensive income) represents the estimated
    maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result
    from operations attributed to the closed block after income
    taxes. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income
    over the period the policies and contracts in the closed block
    remain in-force. Management believes that over time the actual
    cumulative earnings of the closed block will approximately equal
    the expected cumulative earnings due to the effect of dividend
    changes. If, over the period the closed block remains in
    existence, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block is
    greater than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed
    block, the Company will pay the excess of the actual cumulative
    earnings of the closed block over the expected cumulative
    earnings to closed block policyholders as additional
    policyholder dividends unless offset by future unfavorable
    experience of the closed block and, accordingly, will recognize
    only the expected cumulative earnings in income with the excess
    recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation. If over such
    period, the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block is
    less than the expected cumulative earnings of the closed block,
    the Company will recognize only the actual earnings in income.
    However, the Company may change policyholder dividend scales in
    the future, which would be intended to increase future actual
    earnings until the actual cumulative earnings equal the expected
    cumulative earnings.

    rate notes and other notes with varying interest rates, followed
    by subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated
    debentures. Payments of interest and principal on the
    Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other
    obligations at the operating company level and senior to
    obligations at the Holding Company, may be made only with the
    prior approval of the insurance department of the state of
    domicile.

Senior
    Notes

The Holding Company repaid a $500 million 5.25% senior
    note which matured on December 1, 2006 and a
    $1,006 million 3.911% senior note which matured on
    May 15, 2005. RGA repaid a $100 million
    7.25% senior note which matured on April 1, 2006.

On June 28, 2006, Timberlake Financial L.L.C.,
    (“Timberlake”), a subsidiary of RGA, completed an
    offering of $850 million of Series A Floating Rate
    Insured Notes due June 2036, which is included in the
    Company’s long-term debt. Interest on the notes will accrue
    at an annual rate of

1-month

LIBOR plus a base margin, payable monthly. The notes represent
    senior, secured indebtedness of Timberlake Financial, L.L.C.
    with no recourse to RGA or its other subsidiaries. Up to
    $150 million of additional notes may be offered in the
    future. The proceeds of the offering provide long-term
    collateral to support Regulation XXX statutory reserves on
    1.5 million term life insurance policies with guaranteed
    level premium periods reinsured by RGA Reinsurance Company, a
    U.S. subsidiary of RGA. Issuance costs associated with the
    offering of the notes of $13 million have been capitalized,
    are included in other assets, and will be amortized using the
    effective interest method over the period from the issuance date
    of the notes until their maturity.

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is more fully described in Note 2,

Other
    Junior Subordinated Debentures Issued by the Holding
    Company

On December 21, 2006, the Holding Company issued junior
    subordinated debentures with a face amount of
    $1.25 billion. The debentures are scheduled for redemption
    on December 15, 2036; the final maturity of the debentures
    is December 15, 2066. The Holding Company may redeem the
    debentures (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    December 15, 2031 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in
    certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to
    December 15, 2031 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a
    make-whole price. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed
    rate of 6.40% up to, but not including, the scheduled redemption
    date. In the event the debentures are not redeemed on or before
    the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual
    rate of three-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable
    quarterly in arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and
    in certain circumstances the requirement to, defer interest
    payments on the debentures for a period up to ten years.
    Interest compounds during periods of deferral. In connection
    with the issuance of the debentures, the Holding Company entered
    into a replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). As part
    of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not repay,
    redeem, or purchase the debentures on or before
    December 15, 2056, unless, subject to certain limitations,
    it has received proceeds from the sale of specified capital
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the debentures due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of its indebtedness
    (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due June 15,
    2035). Issuance costs associated with the offering of the
    debentures of $13 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and will be amortized using the
    effective interest method over the period from the issuance date
    of the debentures until their scheduled redemption.

Interest expense on the debentures was $2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006.

Other
    Junior Subordinated Debentures Issued by a
    Subsidiary

On December 8, 2005, RGA issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $400 million. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.75% up to but not
    including the scheduled redemption date. The securities may be
    redeemed (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    December 15, 2015 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in
    whole or in part, prior to December 15, 2015 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. In the event the
    junior subordinated debentures are not redeemed on or before the
    scheduled redemption date of December 15, 2015, interest on
    these junior subordinated debentures will accrue at an annual
    rate of three-month LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.665%, payable
    quarterly in arrears. The final maturity of the debentures is
    December 15, 2065. RGA has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during periods of deferral. Issuance costs associated with the
    offering of the junior subordinated debentures of
    $6 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and will be amortized using the effective interest
    method over the period from the issuance date of the junior
    subordinated debentures until their scheduled redemption.

Interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures was
    $27 million and $2 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Common
    Equity Units

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is more fully described in Note 2,
    the Holding Company distributed and sold 82.8 million
    6.375% common equity units for $2,070 million in proceeds
    in a registered public offering on June 21, 2005. As
    described below, the common equity units consist of interests in
    trust preferred securities issued by MetLife Capital
    Trusts II and III, and stock purchase contracts issued
    by the Holding Company. The only assets of MetLife Capital
    Trusts II and III are junior subordinated debentures
    issued by the Holding Company.

Common
    Equity Units

Each common equity unit has an initial stated amount of
    $25 per unit and consists of: (i) a 1/80 or 1.25%
    ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership interest in a
    series A trust preferred security of MetLife Capital
    Trust II (“Series A Trust”), with an initial
    liquidation amount of $1,000; (ii) a 1/80 or 1.25%
    ($12.50), undivided beneficial ownership interest in a
    series B trust preferred security of MetLife Capital
    Trust III (“Series B Trust” and, together
    with the Series A Trust, the “Trusts”), with an
    initial liquidation amount of $1,000; (iii) a stock
    purchase contract under which the holder of the common equity
    unit will purchase and the Holding Company will sell, on each of
    the initial stock purchase date and the subsequent stock
    purchase date, a variable number of shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, for
    a purchase price of $12.50.

Junior
    Subordinated Debentures Issued to Support Trust Common and
    Preferred Securities

The Holding Company issued $1,067 million 4.82%
    Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior
    subordinated debt securities due no later than February 15,
    2039 and February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $2,070 million in
    aggregate proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred
    securities by the Trusts and $64 million in trust common
    securities issued equally by the Trusts. The common and
    preferred securities of the Trusts, totaling
    $2,134 million, represent undivided beneficial ownership
    interests in the assets of the Trusts, have no stated maturity
    and must be redeemed upon maturity of the corresponding series
    of junior subordinated debt securities — the sole
    assets of the respective Trusts. The Series A and
    Series B Trusts will make quarterly distributions on the
    common and preferred securities at an annual rate of 4.82% and
    4.91%, respectively.

The trust common securities, which are held by the Holding
    Company, represent a 3% interest in the Trusts and are reflected
    as fixed maturity securities in the consolidated balance sheet
    of MetLife, Inc. The Trusts are VIEs in accordance with
    FIN No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51, and its December 2003 revision

(“ FIN 46(r)”), and the Company does not
    consolidate its interest in MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III as it is not the primary beneficiary of either of
    the Trusts.

The Holding Company has directly guaranteed the repayment of the
    trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent
    that there are funds available in the Trusts. The guarantee will
    remain in place until the full redemption of the trust preferred
    securities. The trust preferred securities held by the common
    equity unit holders are pledged to the Holding Company to
    collateralize the obligation of the common equity unit holders
    under the related stock purchase contracts. The common equity
    unit holder may substitute certain zero coupon treasury
    securities in place of the trust preferred securities as
    collateral under the stock purchase contract.

The trust preferred securities have remarketing dates which
    correspond with the initial and subsequent stock purchase dates
    to provide the holders of the common equity units with the
    proceeds to exercise the stock purchase contracts. The initial
    stock purchase date is expected to be August 15, 2008, but
    could be deferred for quarterly periods until February 15,
    2009, and the subsequent stock purchase date is expected to be
    February 15, 2009, but could be deferred for quarterly
    periods until February 15, 2010. At the remarketing date,
    the remarketing agent will have the ability to reset the
    interest rate on the trust preferred securities to generate
    sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the common equity
    unit holder’s obligation under the stock purchase contract,
    subject to a reset cap for each of the first two attempted
    remarketings of each series. The interest rate on the supporting
    junior subordinated

F-74


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

debt securities issued by the Holding Company will be reset at a
    commensurate rate. If the initial remarketing is unsuccessful,
    the remarketing agent will attempt to remarket the trust
    preferred securities, as necessary, in subsequent quarters
    through February 15, 2009 for the Series A trust
    preferred securities and through February 15, 2010 for the
    Series B trust preferred securities. The final attempt at
    remarketing will not be subject to the reset cap. If all
    remarketing attempts are unsuccessful, the Holding Company has
    the right, as a secured party, to apply the liquidation amount
    on the trust preferred securities to the common equity unit
    holders obligation under the stock purchase contract and to
    deliver to the common equity unit holder a junior subordinated
    debt security payable on August 15, 2010 at an annual rate
    of 4.82% and 4.91% on the Series A and Series B trust
    preferred securities, respectively, in payment of any accrued
    and unpaid distributions.

Stock
    Purchase Contracts

Each stock purchase contract requires the holder of the common
    equity unit to purchase, and the Holding Company to sell, for
    $12.50, on each of the initial stock purchase date and the
    subsequent stock purchase date, a number of newly issued or
    treasury shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, equal to the applicable settlement
    rate. The settlement rate at the respective stock purchase date
    will be calculated based on the closing price of the common
    stock during a specified

20-day

period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date.
    If the market value of the Holding Company’s common stock
    is less than the threshold appreciation price of $53.10 but
    greater than $43.35, the reference price, the settlement rate
    will be a number of the Holding Company’s common stock
    equal to the stated amount of $12.50 divided by the market
    value. If the market value is less than or equal to the
    reference price, the settlement rate will be 0.28835 shares
    of the Holding Company’s common stock. If the market value
    is greater than or equal to the threshold appreciation price,
    the settlement rate will be 0.23540 shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock. Accordingly, upon settlement in the
    aggregate, the Holding Company will receive proceeds of
    $2,070 million and issue between 39.0 million and
    47.8 million shares of its common stock. The stock purchase
    contract may be exercised at the option of the holder at any
    time prior to the settlement date. However, upon early
    settlement, the holder will receive the minimum settlement rate.

The stock purchase contracts further require the Holding Company
    to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly contract
    payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual rate of
    1.510% on the stated amount of $25 per stock purchase
    contract until the initial stock purchase date and at the annual
    rate of 1.465% on the remaining stated amount of $12.50 per
    stock purchase contract thereafter.

The quarterly distributions on the Series A and
    Series B trust preferred securities of 4.82% and 4.91%,
    respectively, combined with the contract payments on the stock
    purchase contract of 1.510%, (1.465% after the initial stock
    purchase date) result in the 6.375% yield on the common equity
    units.

If the Holding Company defers any of the contract payments on
    the stock purchase contract, then it will accrue additional
    amounts on the deferred amounts at the annual rate of 6.375%
    until paid, to the extent permitted by law.

The value of the stock purchase contracts at issuance,
    $96.6 million, were calculated as the present value of the
    future contract payments due under the stock purchase contract
    of 1.510% through the initial stock purchase date, and 1.465% up
    to the subsequent stock purchase date, discounted at the
    interest rate on the supporting junior subordinated debt
    securities issued by the Holding Company, 4.82% or 4.91% on the
    Series A and Series B trust preferred securities,
    respectively. The value of the stock purchase contracts was
    recorded in other liabilities with an offsetting decrease in
    additional paid-in capital. The other liability balance related
    to the stock purchase contracts will accrue interest at the
    discount rate of 4.82% or 4.91%, as applicable, with an
    offsetting increase to interest expense. When the contract
    payments are made under the stock purchase contracts they will
    reduce the other liability balance. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Holding Company increased
    the other liability balance for the accretion of the discount on
    the contract payment of $3 million and $2 million and
    made contract payments of $31 million and $13 million,
    respectively.

Issuance
    Costs

In connection with the offering of common equity units, the
    Holding Company incurred $55.3 million of issuance costs of
    which $5.8 million relate to the issuance of the junior
    subordinated debt securities underlying common equity units
    which fund the Series A and Series B trust preferred
    securities and $49.5 million relate to the expected
    issuance of the common stock under the stock purchase contracts.
    The $5.8 million in debt issuance costs have been
    capitalized, are included in other assets, and will be amortized
    using the effective interest method over the period from
    issuance date of the common equity units to the initial and
    subsequent stock purchase date. The remaining $49.5 million
    of costs relate to the common stock issuance under the stock
    purchase contracts and have been recorded as a reduction of
    additional paid-in capital.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

The stock purchase contracts are reflected in diluted earnings
    per common share using the treasury stock method, and are
    dilutive when the average closing price of the Holding
    Company’s common stock for each of the 20 trading days
    before the close of the accounting period is greater than or
    equal to the threshold appreciation price of $53.10. During the
    year ended December 31, 2006, the average closing price for
    each of the 20 trading days before December 31, 2006, was
    greater than the threshold appreciation price. Accordingly, the
    stock purchase contracts were included in diluted earnings per
    common share. See Note 19.

Shares Subject
    to Mandatory Redemption and Company-Obligated Mandatorily
    Redeemable Securities of Subsidiary Trusts

GenAmerica Capital I.

In June 1997, GenAmerica
    Corporation (“GenAmerica”) issued $125 million of
    8.525% capital securities through a wholly-owned subsidiary
    trust, GenAmerica Capital I. GenAmerica has fully and
    unconditionally guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, the
    obligation of the trust under the capital securities and is
    obligated to mandatorily redeem the securities on June 30,
    2027. GenAmerica may prepay the securities any time after
    June 30, 2007. Capital securities outstanding were
    $119 million, net of unamortized discounts of
    $6 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.
    Interest expense on these instruments is included in other
    expenses and was $11 million for each of the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

RGA Capital Trust I.

In December 2001,
    RGA, through its wholly-owned trust, RGA Capital Trust I
    (the “Trust”), issued 4,500,000 Preferred Income
    Equity Redeemable Securities (“PIERS”) Units. Each
    PIERS unit consists of: (i) a preferred security issued by
    the Trust, having a stated liquidation amount of $50 per
    unit, representing an undivided beneficial ownership interest in
    the assets of the Trust, which consist solely of junior
    subordinated debentures issued by RGA which have a principal
    amount at maturity of $50 and a stated maturity of
    March 18, 2051; and (ii) a warrant to purchase, at any
    time prior to December 15, 2050, 1.2508 shares of RGA
    stock at an exercise price of $50.

The fair market value of the warrant on the issuance date was
    $14.87 and is detachable from the preferred security. RGA fully
    and unconditionally guarantees, on a subordinated basis, the
    obligations of the Trust under the preferred securities. The
    preferred securities and subordinated debentures were issued at
    a discount (original issue discount) to the face or liquidation
    value of $14.87 per security. The securities will accrete
    to their $50 face/liquidation value over the life of the
    security on a level yield basis. The weighted average effective
    interest rate on the preferred securities and the subordinated
    debentures is 8.25% per annum. Capital securities
    outstanding were $159 million, net of unamortized discounts
    of $66 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Included in the 2005 total tax provision was a $27 million
    tax benefit related to the repatriation of foreign earnings
    pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 965 for which a
    U.S. deferred tax position had previously been recorded.

The Company is under continuous examination by the Internal
    Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities in
    jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business
    operations. The income tax years under examination vary by
    jurisdiction. In 2004, the Company recorded an adjustment of
    $91 million for the settlement of all federal income tax
    issues relating to the IRS’s audit of the Company’s
    tax returns for the years

1997-1999.

Such settlement is reflected in the current year tax expense as
    an adjustment to prior year tax. The Company also received
    $22 million in interest on such settlements and incurred an
    $8 million tax expense on such settlement for a total
    impact to net income of $105 million. The current IRS
    examination covers the years

2000-2002

and the Company expects it to be completed in 2007. The Company
    regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in
    each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent
    years’ examinations. Liabilities for income tax have been

F-77


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

established for future income tax assessments when it is
    probable there will be future assessments and the amount thereof
    can be reasonably estimated. Once established, liabilities for
    uncertain tax positions are adjusted only when there is more
    information available or when an event occurs necessitating a
    change to the liabilities. The Company believes that the
    resolution of income tax matters for open years will not have a
    material effect on its consolidated financial statements
    although the resolution of income tax matters could impact the
    Company’s effective tax rate for a particular future period.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences
    between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Net

    of five years to infinity. Capital loss carryforwards amount to
    $447 million at December 31, 2006 and will expire
    beginning in 2010.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to tax
    benefits of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.
    The valuation allowance reflects management’s assessment,
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that the deferred income tax asset for certain foreign net
    operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. The tax
    benefit will be recognized when management believes that it is
    more likely than not that these deferred income tax assets are
    realizable. In 2006, the Company recorded $40 million of
    additional deferred income tax valuation allowance related to
    certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards.

Contingencies,
    Commitments and Guarantees

Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and yearly basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to liabilities for litigation and
    contingencies to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. The review includes senior legal and
    financial personnel. Unless stated below, estimates of possible
    additional losses or ranges of loss for particular matters
    cannot in the ordinary course be made with a reasonable degree
    of certainty. Liabilities are established when it is probable
    that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be
    reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a
    number of the matters noted below. It is possible that some of
    the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make
    other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could
    not be estimated as of December 31, 2006.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of Metropolitan Life’s plan of reorganization, as amended
    and the adequacy and accuracy of Metropolitan Life’s
    disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. These actions
    discussed below named as defendants some or all of Metropolitan
    Life, the Holding Company, the individual directors, the
    Superintendent and the underwriters for MetLife, Inc.’s
    initial public offering, Goldman Sachs & Company and
    Credit Suisse First Boston. Metropolitan Life, the Holding
    Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
    et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17,
    2000).

Another putative class action filed in New
    York State court in Kings County has been consolidated with this
    action. The plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class
    actions seek compensatory relief and punitive damages. In 2003,
    the trial court granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss
    these two putative class actions. In 2004, the appellate court
    modified the trial court’s order by reinstating certain
    claims against Metropolitan Life, the Holding Company and the
    individual directors. Plaintiffs in these actions have filed a
    consolidated amended complaint. On January 30, 2007, the
    trial court signed an order certifying a litigation class for
    plaintiffs’ claim that defendants violated
    section 7312 of the New York Insurance Law, but denying
    plaintiffs’ motion to certify a litigation class with
    respect

to a common law fraud claim. The January 30, 2007 order

    deciding plaintiffs’ class certification motion. Defendants
    have filed a notice of appeal from this
    decision.     .

Meloy, et al. v. Superintendent of Ins., et al.

Five persons brought a proceeding under
    Article 78 of New York’s Civil Practice Law and Rules
    challenging the Opinion and Decision of the Superintendent who
    approved the Plan. In this proceeding, petitioners sought to
    vacate the Superintendent’s Opinion and Decision and enjoin
    him from granting final approval of the Plan. On
    November 10, 2005, the trial court granted
    respondents’ motions to dismiss this proceeding.
    Petitioners have filed a notice of appeal.

In re MetLife Demutualization Litig.  (E.D.N.Y.,
    filed April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against Metropolitan Life and the Holding Company, plaintiffs
    served a second consolidated amended complaint in 2004.
    Plaintiffs assert violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the Plan,
    claiming that the Policyholder Information Booklets failed to
    disclose certain material facts and contained certain material
    misstatements. They seek rescission and compensatory damages. On
    June 22, 2004, the court denied the defendants’ motion
    to dismiss the claim of violation of the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934. The court had previously denied defendants’ motion
    to dismiss the claim for violation of the Securities Act of
    1933. In 2004, the court reaffirmed its earlier decision denying
    defendants’ motion for summary judgment as premature. On
    July 19, 2005, this federal trial court certified this
    lawsuit as a class action against Metropolitan Life and the
    Holding Company.

Fotia, et al.  v. MetLife, Inc., et al.
    (Ont. Super. Ct., filed April 3, 2001).

This
    lawsuit was filed in Ontario, Canada on behalf of a proposed
    class of certain former Canadian policyholders against the
    Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, and Metropolitan Life
    Insurance Company of Canada. Plaintiffs’ allegations
    concern the way that their policies were treated in connection
    with the demutualization of Metropolitan Life; they seek
    damages, declarations, and other non-pecuniary relief.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

Metropolitan Life is and has been a defendant in a large number
    of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. Metropolitan Life has
    never engaged in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products
    nor has Metropolitan Life issued liability or workers’
    compensation insurance to companies in the business of
    manufacturing, producing, distributing or selling asbestos or
    asbestos-containing products. The lawsuits principally have
    focused on allegations with respect to certain research,
    publication and other activities of one or more of Metropolitan
    Life’s employees during the period from the 1920’s
    through approximately the 1950’s and allege that
    Metropolitan Life learned or should have learned of certain
    health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things,
    improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks.
    Metropolitan Life believes that it should not have legal
    liability in these cases. The outcome of most asbestos
    litigation matters, however, is uncertain and can be impacted by
    numerous variables, including differences in legal rulings in
    various jurisdictions, the nature of the alleged injury, and
    factors unrelated to the ultimate legal merit of the claims
    asserted against Metropolitan Life. Metropolitan Life employs a
    number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos loss
    exposure, including seeking resolution of pending litigation by
    judicial rulings and settling litigation under appropriate
    circumstances.

Claims asserted against Metropolitan Life have included
    negligence, intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the
    health risks associated with asbestos. Metropolitan Life’s
    defenses (beyond denial of certain factual allegations) include
    that: (i) Metropolitan Life owed no duty to the
    plaintiffs — it had no special relationship with the
    plaintiffs and did not manufacture, produce, distribute or sell
    the asbestos products that allegedly injured plaintiffs;
    (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any actions of Metropolitan
    Life; (iii) Metropolitan Life’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries; (iv) that
    plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers of asbestos
    were known; and (v) the applicable time with respect to
    filing suit has expired. Since 2002, trial courts in California,
    Utah, Georgia, New York, Texas, and Ohio have granted motions
    dismissing claims against Metropolitan Life. Some

courts have denied Metropolitan Life’s motions to dismiss.
    There can be no assurance that Metropolitan Life will receive
    favorable decisions on motions in the future. While most cases
    brought to date have settled, Metropolitan Life intends to
    continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos
    exposure.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against Metropolitan Life as of the dates indicated, the
    approximate number of new claims during the years ended on those
    dates and the approximate total settlement payments made to
    resolve asbestos personal injury claims during those years are
    set forth in the following table:

Settlement payments represent payments made by Metropolitan Life
    during the year in connection with settlements made in that year
    and in prior years. Amounts do not include Metropolitan
    Life’s attorneys’ fees and expenses and do not reflect
    amounts received from insurance carriers.

In 2003, Metropolitan Life received approximately 58,750 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 111,700
    claims, and paid approximately $84.2 million for
    settlements reached in 2003 and prior years. The number of
    asbestos cases that may be brought or the aggregate amount of
    any liability that Metropolitan Life may ultimately incur is
    uncertain.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    Metropolitan Life’s recorded asbestos liability is based on
    Metropolitan Life’s estimation of the following elements,
    as informed by the facts presently known to it, its
    understanding of current law, and its past experiences:
    (i) the reasonably probable and estimable liability for
    asbestos claims already asserted against Metropolitan Life
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    reasonably probable and estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against Metropolitan Life, but which
    Metropolitan Life believes are reasonably probable of assertion;
    and (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the
    foregoing claims. Significant assumptions underlying
    Metropolitan Life’s analysis of the adequacy of its
    liability with respect to asbestos litigation include:
    (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the cost to
    resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.

Metropolitan Life regularly re-evaluates its exposure from
    asbestos litigation, including studying its claims experience,
    reviewing external literature regarding asbestos claims
    experience in the United States, assessing relevant trends
    impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous variables
    that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an overall or
    per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies of other
    companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative and
    judicial developments, the number of pending claims involving
    serious disease, the number of new claims filed against it and
    other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which claims are
    pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 Metropolitan Life
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Metropolitan Life regularly reevaluates its
    exposure from asbestos litigation and has updated its liability
    analysis for asbestos-related claims through December 31,
    2006.

The ability of Metropolitan Life to estimate its ultimate
    asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty and the
    conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to
    change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is
    difficult to predict with any certainty the numerous variables
    that can affect liability estimates, including the number of
    future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and
    severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of
    the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations

F-81


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the
    possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of
    courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against Metropolitan
    Life when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of
    asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any
    possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be reasonably
    probable and estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

During 1998, Metropolitan Life paid $878 million in
    premiums for excess insurance policies for asbestos-related
    claims. The excess insurance policies for asbestos-related
    claims provide for recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion,
    which is in excess of a $400 million self-insured
    retention. The asbestos-related policies are also subject to
    annual and per-claim sublimits. Amounts are recoverable under
    the policies annually with respect to claims paid during the
    prior calendar year. Although amounts paid by Metropolitan Life
    in any given year that may be recoverable in the next calendar
    year under the policies will be reflected as a reduction in the
    Company’s operating cash flows for the year in which they
    are paid, management believes that the payments will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity.

Each asbestos-related policy contains an experience fund and a
    reference fund that provides for payments to Metropolitan Life
    at the commutation date if the reference fund is greater than
    zero at commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in
    the loss reimbursements to Metropolitan Life if the cumulative
    return on the reference fund is less than the return specified
    in the experience fund. The return in the reference fund is tied
    to performance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
    and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. A claim with
    respect to the prior year was made under the excess insurance
    policies in each of 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006 for the amounts
    paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of the
    retention. As the performance of the indices impacts the return
    in the reference fund, it is possible that loss reimbursements
    to the Company and the recoverable amount with respect to later
    periods may be less than the amount of the recorded losses.
    Foregone loss reimbursements may be recovered upon commutation
    depending upon future performance of the reference fund. If at
    some point in the future, the Company believes the liability for
    probable and reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related
    claims should be increased, an expense would be recorded and the
    insurance recoverable would be adjusted subject to the terms,
    conditions and limits of the excess insurance policies. Portions
    of the change in the insurance recoverable would be recorded as
    a deferred gain and amortized into income over the estimated
    remaining settlement period of the insurance policies. The
    foregone loss reimbursements were approximately
    $8.3 million with respect to 2002 claims,
    $15.5 million with respect to 2003 claims,
    $15.1 million with respect to 2004 claims,
    $12.7 million with respect to 2005 claims, and estimated to
    be approximately $5.0 million with respect to 2006 claims
    and are estimated, as of December 31, 2006, to be
    approximately $72.2 million in the aggregate, including
    future years.

Sales
    Practices Claims

Over the past several years, Metropolitan Life, New England
    Mutual Life Insurance Company (“New England Mutual”),
    New England Life Insurance Company and General American Life
    Insurance Company (“General American”), have faced
    numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging
    improper marketing and sales of individual life insurance
    policies or annuities. In addition, claims have been brought
    relating to the sale of mutual funds and other products.

As of December 31, 2006, there were approximately 280 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against Metropolitan Life;
    approximately 41 sales practices litigation matters pending
    against New England Mutual, New England Life Insurance Company
    and New England Securities Corporation (collectively, “New
    England”);

F-82


METLIFE,

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

approximately 37 sales practices litigation matters pending
    against General American; and approximately 20 sales practices
    litigation matters pending against Walnut Street Securities,
    Inc. (“Walnut Street”). In addition, similar
    litigation matters are pending against MetLife Securities, Inc.
    (“MSI”). Metropolitan Life, New England, General
    American, MSI and Walnut Street continue to vigorously defend
    against the claims in these matters. Some sales practices claims
    have been resolved through settlement, others have been won by
    dispositive motions or have gone to trial. Most of the current
    cases seek substantial damages, including in some cases punitive
    and treble damages and attorneys’ fees. Additional
    litigation relating to the Company’s marketing and sales of
    individual life insurance, mutual funds and other products may
    be commenced in the future.

Two putative class action lawsuits involving sales practices
    claims were filed against Metropolitan Life in Canada. In

Jacynthe Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
    (Que. Super. Ct., filed March 1998)

, plaintiff alleges
    misrepresentations regarding dividends and future payments for
    life insurance policies and seeks unspecified damages. In

Ace
    Quan v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (Ont. Gen. Div., filed
    April 1997)

, plaintiff alleges breach of contract and
    negligent misrepresentations relating to, among other things,
    life insurance premium payments and seeks damages, including
    punitive damages. By agreement of the parties, Metropolitan Life
    has not yet filed a response in this action.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to Metropolitan
    Life’s, New England’s, General American’s,
    MSI’s or Walnut Street’s sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities or other products. Over the past
    several years, these and a number of investigations by other
    regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and
    certain other relief. The Company may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner. The Company believes
    adequate provision has been made in its consolidated financial
    statements for all probable and reasonably estimable losses for
    sales practices claims against Metropolitan Life, New England,
    General American, MSI and Walnut Street.

Property
    and Casualty Actions

Katrina-Related Litigation.

There are a number
    of lawsuits, including a few putative class actions, pending in
    Louisiana and, Mississippi against Metropolitan Property and
    Casualty Insurance Company (“MPC”) relating to
    Hurricane Katrina. The lawsuits include claims by policyholders
    for coverage for damages stemming from Hurricane Katrina,
    including for damages resulting from flooding or storm surge. It
    is reasonably possible that other actions will be filed. The
    Company is vigorously defending against the claims in these
    matters.

Stern v. Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. (S.D. Fla.,
    filed October 18, 1999).

A putative class
    action, seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief has
    been filed against MPC’s subsidiary, Metropolitan Casualty
    Insurance Company, in Florida alleging breach of contract and
    unfair trade practices with respect to allowing the use of parts
    not made by the original manufacturer to repair damaged
    automobiles. Discovery is ongoing and a motion for class
    certification is pending. The Company is vigorously defending
    against the claims in this matter.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against MPC in Illinois. One suit claims breach of
    contract and fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical
    claims arising from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee
    pricing system. A motion for class certification has been filed
    and briefed. The second suit originally alleged breach of
    contract and fraud arising from the alleged use of preferred
    provider organizations to reduce medical provider fees covered
    by the medical claims portion of the insurance policy. The court
    granted MPC’s motion to dismiss the fraud claim in the
    second suit. A motion for class certification has been filed and
    briefed. The Company is vigorously defending against the claims
    in these matters.

Regulatory
    Matters and Related Litigation

Regulatory bodies have contacted the Company and have requested
    information relating to market timing and late trading of mutual
    funds and variable insurance products and, generally, the
    marketing of products. The

F-83


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company believes that many of these inquiries are similar to
    those made to many financial services companies as part of
    industry-wide investigations by various regulatory agencies. The
    SEC has commenced an investigation with respect to market timing
    and late trading in a limited number of privately-placed
    variable insurance contracts that were sold through General
    American. As previously reported, in May 2004, General American
    received a Wells Notice stating that the SEC staff is
    considering recommending that the SEC bring a civil action
    alleging violations of the U.S. securities laws against
    General American. Under the SEC procedures, General American can
    avail itself of the opportunity to respond to the SEC staff
    before it makes a formal recommendation regarding whether any
    action alleging violations of the U.S. securities laws
    should be considered. General American has responded to the
    Wells Notice. The Company is fully cooperating with regard to
    these information requests and investigations. The Company at
    the present time is not aware of any systemic problems with
    respect to such matters that may have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s consolidated financial position.

In December 2006, Metropolitan Life resolved a previously
    disclosed investigation by the Office of the Attorney General of
    the State of New York related to payments to intermediaries in
    the marketing and sale of group life and disability, group
    long-term care and group accidental death and dismemberment
    insurance and related matters. In the settlement, Metropolitan
    Life did not admit liability as to any issue of fact or law.
    Among other things, Metropolitan Life has agreed to certain
    business reforms relating to compensation of producers of group
    insurance, compensation disclosures to group insurance clients
    and the adoption of related standards of conduct, some of which
    it had implemented following the commencement of the
    investigation. Metropolitan Life has paid a fine and has made a
    payment to a restitution fund. It is the opinion of management
    that Metropolitan Life’s resolution of this matter will not
    adversely affect its business. The Company has received
    subpoenas

and/or

other
    discovery requests from regulators, state attorneys general or
    other governmental authorities in other states, including
    Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Florida, and Ohio,
    seeking, among other things, information and documents regarding
    contingent commission payments to brokers, the Company’s
    awareness of any “sham” bids for business, bids and
    quotes that the Company submitted to potential customers,
    incentive agreements entered into with brokers, or compensation
    paid to intermediaries. The Company also has received a subpoena
    from the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
    District of California asking for documents regarding the
    insurance broker Universal Life Resources. The Company continues
    to cooperate fully with these inquiries and is responding to the
    subpoenas and other discovery requests.

Approximately sixteen broker-related lawsuits in which the
    Company was named as a defendant were filed. Voluntary
    dismissals and consolidations have reduced the number of pending
    actions to two:

The People of the State of California, by and through John
    Garamendi, Ins. Commissioner of the State of California v.
    MetLife, Inc., et al. (Cal. Super. Ct., County of
    San Diego, filed November 18, 2004).

The
    California Insurance Commissioner filed suit against
    Metropolitan Life and other non-affiliated companies alleging
    that the defendants violated certain provisions of the
    California Insurance Code. This action seeks injunctive relief
    relating to compensation disclosures.

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district proceeding,
    plaintiffs have filed an amended class action complaint
    consolidating the claims from separate actions that had been
    filed in or transferred to the District of New Jersey in 2004
    and 2005. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that the
    Holding Company, Metropolitan Life, several non-affiliated
    insurance companies and several insurance brokers violated RICO,
    ERISA, and antitrust laws and committed other misconduct in the
    context of providing insurance to employee benefit plans and to
    persons who participate in such employee benefit plans.
    Plaintiffs seek to represent classes of employers that
    established employee benefit plans and persons who participated
    in such employee benefit plans. A motion for class certification
    has been filed. A motion to dismiss has not been fully decided.
    Plaintiffs in several other actions have voluntarily dismissed
    their claims. The Company is vigorously defending against the
    claims in these matters.

Following an inquiry commencing in March 2004, the staff of NASD
    notified MSI that it made a preliminary determination to
    recommend charging MSI with the failure to adopt, maintain and
    enforce written supervisory

procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with
    suitability requirements regarding the sale of college savings
    plans, also known as 529 plans. This notification followed an
    industry-wide inquiry by NASD examining sales of 529 plans. In
    November 2006, MSI and NASD reached a settlement resolving the
    matter, which includes payment of a penalty and customer
    remediation. MSI neither admitted nor denied NASD’s
    findings.

In February 2006, the Company learned that the SEC commenced a
    formal investigation of New England Securities (“NES”)
    in connection with the suitability of its sales of variable
    universal life insurance policies. The Company believes that
    others in the insurance industry are the subject of similar
    investigations by the SEC. NES is cooperating fully with the SEC.

In 2005, MSI received a notice from the Illinois Department of
    Securities asserting possible violations of the Illinois
    Securities Act in connection with sales of a former
    affiliate’s mutual funds. A response has been submitted and
    MSI intends to cooperate fully with the Illinois Department of
    Securities.

A former registered representative of Tower Square Securities,
    Inc. (“Tower Square”), a broker-dealer subsidiary of
    Metlife Insurance Company of Connecticut (“MICC”), is
    alleged to have defrauded individuals by diverting funds for his
    personal use. In June 2005, the SEC issued a formal order of
    investigation with respect to Tower Square and served Tower
    Square with a subpoena. The Securities and Business Investments
    Division of the Connecticut Department of Banking and NASD are
    also reviewing this matter. On April 18, 2006, the
    Connecticut Department of Banking issued a notice to Tower
    Square asking it to demonstrate its prior compliance with
    applicable Connecticut securities laws and regulations. In the
    context of the above, a number of NASD arbitration matters and
    litigation matters were commenced in 2005 and 2006 against Tower
    Square. It is reasonably possible that other actions will be
    brought regarding this matter. Tower Square intends to fully
    cooperate with the SEC, NASD and the Connecticut Department of
    Banking, as appropriate, with respect to the matters described
    above.

Other
    Litigation

Roberts, et al. v. Tishman Speyer Properties,
    et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed January 22,
    2007).

This lawsuit was filed by a putative class
    of “market rate” tenants at Stuyvesant Town and Peter
    Cooper Village against parties including Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company and Metropolitan Insurance and Annuity
    Company. Metropolitan Life was initially a named defendant but
    the action has been discontinued as to Metropolitan Life since
    it did not own the properties during the time period in
    question. This group of tenants claims that the MetLife
    entities, and since the sale of the properties, Tishman Speyer
    as current owner, improperly charged market rents when only
    lower regulated rents were permitted. The allegations are based
    on the impact of so-called J-51 tax abatements. The lawsuit
    seeks declaratory relief and damages.

Carroll v. Tishman
    Speyer Properties, et al. (Sup. Ct., N.Y. County, filed
    February 14, 2007).

A second putative class
    action was filed against the same defendants alleging similar
    claims as in the Roberts lawsuit, and in addition includes a
    claim of unjust enrichment and purported violation of New York
    General Business Law Section 349. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend against the claims in both actions.

Brubaker, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,
    et al. (D.C. Cir., filed October 20,
    2000).

Plaintiffs, in this putative class action
    lawsuit, allege that they were denied certain ad hoc pension
    increases awarded to retirees under the Metropolitan Life
    retirement plan. The ad hoc pension increases were awarded only
    to retirees (i.e., individuals who were entitled to an immediate
    retirement benefit upon their termination of employment) and not
    available to individuals like these plaintiffs whose employment,
    or whose spouses’ employment, had terminated before they
    became eligible for an immediate retirement benefit. The
    plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting of former
    Metropolitan Life employees, or their surviving spouses, who are
    receiving deferred vested annuity payments under the retirement
    plan and who were allegedly eligible to receive the ad hoc
    pension increases. In September 2005, Metropolitan Life’s
    motion for summary judgment was granted. Plaintiffs’ motion
    for reconsideration was denied. Plaintiffs appealed to the
    United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit. The parties are currently briefing the appeal and oral
    argument is set for March 15, 2007.

The

    sued the Holding Company, Metropolitan Life and other
    non-affiliated insurance companies in a putative class action
    lawsuit. The plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class
    of

    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. The
    district court has granted in part and denied in part the
    Company’s motion to dismiss. The Company has filed another
    motion to dismiss. The court has issued a tag-along order,

    the federal securities laws and violations of state laws with
    respect to the sale of certain proprietary products (as opposed
    to non-proprietary products) by the Company’s agency
    distribution group. Plaintiff seeks rescission, compensatory

    claims in this matter.

Macomber, et al. v. Travelers Property Casualty
    Corp., et al. (Conn. Super. Ct., Hartford, filed
    April 7, 1999).

An amended putative class
    action complaint was filed against The Travelers Life and
    Annuity Company (now known as MetLife Life and Annuity Company
    of Connecticut (“MLAC”)), Travelers Equity Sales, Inc.
    and certain former affiliates. The amended complaint alleges
    Travelers Property Casualty Corporation, a former MLAC
    affiliate, purchased structured settlement annuities from MLAC
    and spent less on the purchase of those structured settlement
    annuities than agreed with claimants, and that commissions paid
    to brokers for the structured settlement annuities, including an
    affiliate of MLAC, were paid in part to Travelers Property
    Casualty Corporation. On May 26, 2004, the Connecticut
    Superior Court certified a nationwide class action involving the
    following claims against MLAC: violation of the Connecticut
    Unfair Trade Practice Statute, unjust enrichment, and civil
    conspiracy. On June 15, 2004, the defendants appealed the
    class certification order. In March 2006, the Connecticut
    Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s certification of a
    class. Plaintiff may seek to file another motion for class
    certification. Defendants have moved for summary judgment. The
    Company is continuing to vigorously defend against the claims in
    this matter.

Metropolitan Life also has been named as a defendant in a number
    of silicosis, welding and mixed dust cases in various states.
    The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed above and those otherwise provided
    for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements,
    have arisen in the course of the Company’s business,
    including, but not limited to, in connection with its activities
    as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor and
    taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and
    other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and
    conduct investigations concerning the Company’s compliance
    with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted above in
    connection with specific matters. In some of the matters
    referred to above, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s consolidated
    financial position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require life insurers doing business within
    the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which
    are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to
    insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed life
    insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed
    limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the
    basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by
    member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired,
    insolvent or failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member
    insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial
    premium tax offsets. Assets and liabilities held for insolvency
    assessments are as follows:

Impact
    of Hurricanes

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in the
    states of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, causing
    catastrophic damage to these coastal regions. MetLife’s
    cumulative gross losses from Hurricane Katrina were
    $333 million and $335 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily arising from the
    Company’s homeowners business. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized total
    net losses, net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables and
    including reinstatement premiums and other reinsurance-related
    premium adjustments related to the catastrophe as follows:

On October 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall across
    the state of Florida. MetLife’s cumulative gross losses
    from Hurricane Wilma were $64 million and $57 million
    at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, primarily
    arising from the Company’s homeowners and automobile
    businesses. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the Company’s Auto & Home segment recognized
    total losses, net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables, of
    $29 million and $32 million, respectively, related to
    Hurricane Wilma.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Additional hurricane-related losses may be recorded in future
    periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to
    reinsurers are processed. Reinsurance recoveries are dependent
    upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers, which may
    be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with
    Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma and otherwise. In addition,
    lawsuits, including purported class actions, have been filed in
    Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama challenging denial of claims
    for damages caused to property during Hurricane Katrina. MPC is
    a named party in some of these lawsuits. In addition, rulings in
    cases in which MPC is not a party may affect interpretation of
    its policies. MPC intends to vigorously defend these matters.
    However, any adverse rulings could result in an increase in the
    Company’s hurricane-related claim exposure and losses.
    Based on information known by management, it does not believe
    that additional claim losses resulting from Hurricane Katrina
    will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Argentina

The Argentinean economic, regulatory and legal environment,
    including interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators
    and courts, is uncertain. Potential legal or governmental
    actions related to pension reform, fiduciary responsibilities,
    performance guarantees and tax rulings could adversely affect
    the results of the Company. Upon acquisition of Citigroup’s
    insurance operations in Argentina, the Company established
    insurance liabilities, most significantly death and disability
    policy liabilities, based upon its interpretation of Argentinean
    law and the Company’s best estimate of its obligations
    under such law. In 2006, a decree was issued by the Argentine
    Government regarding the taxability of pesification-related
    gains resulting in the reduction of certain tax liabilities. See
    Note 2.

Commitments

Leases

In accordance with industry practice, certain of the
    Company’s income from lease agreements with retail tenants
    are contingent upon the level of the tenants’ sales
    revenues. Additionally, the Company, as lessee, has entered into
    various lease and sublease agreements for office space, data
    processing and other equipment. Future minimum rental and
    sublease income, and minimum gross rental payments relating to
    these lease agreements are as follows:

    the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded
    commitments were $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company
    anticipates that these amounts will be invested in partnerships
    over the next five years.

Other
    Commitments

MICC is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
    (the “FHLB of Boston”) and holds $70 million of
    common stock of the FHLB of Boston, which is included in equity
    securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
    MICC has also entered into several funding agreements with the
    FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has issued such funding agreements
    in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of Boston has been
    granted a blanket lien on MICC’s residential mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MICC’s
    obligations under the funding agreements. MICC maintains control
    over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or
    dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no
    event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is
    sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The
    funding agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery is limited
    to the amount of MICC’s liability under the outstanding
    funding agreements. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was
    $926 million and $1.1 billion at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, which is included in PABs.

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds
    $54 million and $43 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet. MetLife Bank has also entered into
    repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank
    has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket lien on MetLife
    Bank’s residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities
    to collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations under the
    repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control over these
    pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of
    any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The repurchase
    agreements and the related security agreement represented by
    this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by
    MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is limited to the
    amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the outstanding
    repurchase agreements. The amount of the Company’s
    liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY was
    $998 million and $855 million at December 31,
    2006 and 2005, respectively, which is included in long-term debt.

Metropolitan Life is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds
    $136 million of common stock of the FHLB of NY, which is
    included in equity securities on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. Metropolitan Life had no funding agreements with
    the FHLB of NY at December 31, 2006 or 2005.

On December 12, 2005, RGA repurchased 1.6 million
    shares of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate price of
    $76 million under an accelerated share repurchase agreement
    with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to RGA from
    third parties and purchased the shares in the open market over
    the subsequent few months to return to the lenders. RGA would
    either pay or receive an amount based on the actual amount paid
    by the bank to purchase the shares. These repurchases resulted
    in an increase in the Company’s ownership percentage of RGA
    to approximately 53% at December 31, 2005 from
    approximately 52% at December 31, 2004. In February 2006,
    the final purchase price was determined, resulting in a cash
    settlement substantially equal to the aggregate cost. RGA

recorded the initial repurchase of shares as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
    ownership was approximately 53% of RGA.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $2 billion, with a cumulative maximum of
    $3.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are not
    specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are
    not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it
    is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could
    become due under these guarantees in the future.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company did
    not record any additional liabilities for indemnities,
    guarantees and commitments. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the
    Company eliminated $4 million of a liability that was
    previously recorded with respect to indemnities provided in
    connection with a certain disposition. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities at December 31, 2006 and 2005 for
    indemnities, guarantees and commitments were $5 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    requiring payment of principal due in exchange for the
    referenced credit obligation, depending on the nature or
    occurrence of specified credit events for the referenced
    entities. In the event of a specified credit event, the
    Company’s maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of the
    referenced credits becomes worthless, was $396 million at
    December 31, 2006. The credit default swaps expire at
    various times during the next ten years.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering eligible employees and sales representatives who meet
    specified eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are
    provided utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance
    formula. The traditional formula provides benefits based upon
    years of credited service and either final average or career
    average earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical
    or notional accounts which credit participants with benefits
    equal to a percentage of eligible pay as well as earnings
    credits, determined

annually based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. As of
    December 31, 2006, virtually all of the Subsidiaries’
    obligations have been calculated using the traditional formula.
    The non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits,
    in excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to
    certain executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement health and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers, the employees
    of Travelers and any other Citigroup affiliate in the United
    States who became employees of certain Subsidiaries in
    connection with that acquisition (including those who remained
    employees of companies acquired in that acquisition) will be
    credited with service recognized by Citigroup for purposes of
    determining eligibility and vesting under the Plan with respect
    to benefits earned under the Plan subsequent to the closing date
    of the acquisition. Neither the Holding Company nor its
    subsidiaries assumed an obligation for benefits earned under
    defined benefit plans of Citigroup or Travelers prior to the
    acquisition.

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158. The
    adoption of SFAS 158 required the recognition of the funded
    status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans
    and eliminated the additional minimum pension liability
    provision of SFAS 87. The Company’s additional minimum
    pension liability was $78 million, and the intangible asset
    was $12 million, at December 31, 2005. The excess of
    the additional minimum pension liability over the intangible
    asset of $66 million, $41 million net of income tax,
    was recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income. At December 31, 2006, immediately prior to adopting
    SFAS 158, the Company’s additional minimum pension
    liability was $92 million. The additional minimum pension
    liability of $59 million, net of income tax of
    $33 million, was recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. The change in the additional minimum
    pension liability of $18 million, net of income tax, was
    reflected as a component of comprehensive income for the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Upon adoption of SFAS 158,
    the Company eliminated the additional minimum pension liability
    and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, net of income tax, those amounts of
    actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and
    the remaining net transition asset or obligation that had not
    yet been included in net periodic benefit cost at the date of
    adoption. The following table

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for
    the pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other
    comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the
    next year are $54 million and $12 million,
    respectively.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credit for
    the other postretirement plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit
    cost over the next year are $14 million and
    $36 million, respectively.

As discussed more fully in Note 1, the Company adopted the
    guidance in FSP

106-2

to
    account for future subsidies to be received under the
    Prescription Drug Act. The Company began receiving these
    subsidies during 2006. The APBO was remeasured effective
    July 1, 2004 in order to determine the effect of the
    expected subsidies on net periodic other postretirement benefit
    cost. As a result, the APBO was reduced by $213 million at
    July 1, 2004. A summary of the reduction to the APBO and
    related reduction to the components of net periodic other
    postretirement benefit cost is as follows:

The discount rate is based on the yield of a hypothetical
    portfolio constructed of bonds rated AA or better by
    Moody’s Investors Services available on the valuation date
    measured on a yield to worst basis, which would provide the
    necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate projected
    benefit obligation when due.

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on
    anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which
    the plan invests, weighted by target allocation percentages.
    Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical
    returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the
    Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on the performance of
    the markets. While the precise expected return derived using
    this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the
    Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term assumption
    constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from
    the derived rate.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets for use in
    that plan’s valuation in 2007 is currently anticipated to
    be 8.25% for pension benefits and postretirement medical
    benefits and 6.25% for postretirement life benefits.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

Plan
    Assets

The Subsidiaries have issued group annuity and life insurance
    contracts supporting approximately 98% of all pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans assets.

The account values of the group annuity and life insurance
    contracts issued by the Subsidiaries and held as assets of the
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans were
    $7,321 million and $6,471 million as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The majority of
    such account values are held in separate accounts established by
    the Subsidiaries. Total revenue from these contracts recognized
    in the consolidated statements of income was $29 million,
    $28 million and $28 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and
    includes policy charges, net investment income from investments
    backing the contracts and administrative fees. Total investment
    income, including realized and unrealized gains and losses,
    credited to the

account balances were $818 million, $460 million and
    $519 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. The terms of these contracts are
    consistent in all material respects with those the Subsidiaries
    offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective
    of maximizing returns and minimizing volatility of net assets
    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions.

Cash
    Flows

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974, as amended,

and/or

to
    maintain a fully funded ABO. In accordance with such practice,
    no contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 or 2005. No contributions will be
    required for 2007. The Subsidiaries elected to make
    discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plans of
    $350 million during the year ended December 31, 2006.
    No contributions were made during the year ended
    December 31, 2005. The Subsidiaries expect to make
    additional discretionary contributions of $150 million in
    2007.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $38 million and $35 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These payments
    are expected to be at approximately the same level in 2007.

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have partially funded such
    plans in advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to
    use their general assets to pay claims as they come due in lieu
    of utilizing plan assets. These payments totaled
    $152 million and $160 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

F-97


METLIFE,

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $132 million, based upon expected gross benefit payments,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2007. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

Gross benefit payments for the next ten years, which reflect
    expected future service where appropriate, and gross subsidies
    to be received under the Prescription Drug Act are expected to
    be as follows:

The Subsidiaries sponsor savings and investment plans for
    substantially all employees under which a portion of employee
    contributions are matched. The Subsidiaries contributed

    years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Equity

Preferred
    Stock

On September 29, 1999, the Holding Company adopted a
    stockholder rights plan (the “rights plan”) under
    which each outstanding share of common stock issued between
    April 4, 2000 and the distribution date (as defined in the
    rights plan) will be coupled with a stockholder right. Each
    right will entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a
    share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.
    Each one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
    Participating Preferred Stock will have economic and voting
    terms equivalent to one share of common stock. Until it is
    exercised, the right itself will not entitle the holder thereof
    to any rights as a stockholder, including the right to receive
    dividends or to vote at stockholder meetings.

Stockholder rights are not exercisable until the distribution
    date, and will expire at the close of business on April 4,
    2010, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Holding
    Company. The rights plan is designed to protect stockholders in
    the event of unsolicited offers to acquire the Holding Company
    and other coercive takeover tactics.

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is more fully described in Note 2,
    the Holding Company issued preferred shares as follows:

On June 13, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    24 million shares of Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred
    Stock, Series A (the “Series A preferred
    shares”) with a $0.01 par value per share, and a
    liquidation preference of $25 per share, for aggregate
    proceeds of $600 million.

On June 16, 2005, the Holding Company issued
    60 million shares of 6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock,
    Series B (the “Series B preferred shares”),
    with a $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation
    preference of $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of
    $1.5 billion.

The Series A and Series B preferred shares (the
    “Preferred Shares”) rank senior to the common stock
    with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on
    the Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the
    Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments
    only when, as and if declared by the Holding

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company’s Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee
    of the board. If dividends are declared on the Series A
    preferred shares, they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at
    an annual rate of the greater of: (i) 1.00% above
    three-month LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the Holding Company has no obligation to
    pay dividends accrued for that dividend period whether or not
    dividends are declared and paid in future periods. No dividends
    may, however, be paid or declared on the Holding Company’s
    common stock — or any other securities ranking junior
    to the Preferred Shares — unless the full dividends
    for the latest completed dividend period on all Preferred
    Shares, and any parity stock, have been declared and paid or
    provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Board policy, the Holding
    Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn
    sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share,
    plus declared and unpaid dividends.

In connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, the
    Holding Company incurred $56.8 million of issuance costs
    which have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
    capital.

Common
    Stock

On October 26, 2004, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized a $1 billion common stock repurchase
    program. On February 27, 2007, the Holding Company’s
    Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion
    common stock repurchase program. Upon the date of this
    authorization, the amount remaining under these repurchase
    programs is approximately $1.2 billion. Under these
    authorizations, the Holding Company may purchase its common
    stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market
    (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan
    meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) and in
    privately negotiated transactions. As a result of the
    acquisition of Travelers, the Holding

Company had suspended its common stock repurchase activity.
    During the fourth quarter of 2006, as announced, the Holding
    Company resumed its share repurchase program. Future common
    stock repurchases will be dependent upon several factors,
    including the Company’s capital position, its financial
    strength and credit ratings, general market conditions and the
    price of the Company’s common stock.

On December 1, 2006, the Holding Company repurchased
    3,993,024 shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $232 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the common stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties
    and purchased the common stock in the open market to return to
    such third parties. In February 2007, the Holding Company paid a
    cash adjustment of $8 million for a final purchase price of
    $240 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

On December 16, 2004, the Holding Company repurchased
    7,281,553 shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $300 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties and
    purchased the common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. In April 2005, the Holding Company received a
    cash adjustment of $7 million based on the actual amount
    paid by the bank to purchase the common stock, for a final
    purchase price of $293 million. The Holding Company
    recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury stock and
    recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the cost of the
    treasury stock.

See Note 12 regarding stock purchase contracts issued by
    the Holding Company on June 21, 2005 in connection with the
    issuance of the common equity units.

The Company acquired 8,608,824, 0 and 26,373,952 shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock for $500 million,
    $0 and $1.0 billion during the years ended December 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, 3,056,559, 25,049,065 and
    1,675,814 shares of common stock were issued from treasury
    stock for $102 million, $819 million and
    $50 million, respectively, of which 22,436,617 shares
    with a market value of $1 billion were issued in connection
    with the acquisition of Travelers on July 1, 2005. See
    Note 2. At December 31, 2006, the Holding Company had
    $216 million remaining on the October 26, 2004 common
    stock repurchase program which was subsequently reduced by
    $8 million to $208 million after the February 2007
    cash adjustment on the accelerated stock repurchase discussed
    above.

Under New York State Insurance Law, Metropolitan Life is
    permitted, without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay
    stockholder dividends to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does
    not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to
    policyholders as of the end of the immediately preceding
    calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain from
    operations for the immediately preceding calendar year
    (excluding realized capital gains). Metropolitan Life will be
    permitted to pay a cash dividend to the Holding Company in
    excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice
    of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount
    thereof with the Superintendent and the Superintendent does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    Under New York State Insurance Law, the Superintendent has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock life insurance company would support the payment of such
    dividends to its shareholders. The New York State Department of
    Insurance (the “Department”) has established informal
    guidelines for such determinations. The guidelines, among other
    things, focus on the insurer’s overall financial condition
    and profitability under statutory accounting practices.

Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, MICC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay shareholder
    dividends to its parent as long as the amount of such dividends,
    when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year.
    MICC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend in excess of the
    greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of its
    declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the
    Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance (“Commissioner”)
    and the Commissioner does not disapprove the payment within

    exceeds earned surplus (unassigned funds, reduced by 25% of
    unrealized appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or

    Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, the Commissioner has
    broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition
    of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of

Under Rhode Island State Insurance Law, MPC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a
    stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any twelve-month
    period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its
    surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) net income, not including
    realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar
    year. MPC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the
    Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only
    if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend
    and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island Commissioner of
    Insurance (the “Rhode Island Commissioner”) and the
    Rhode Island Commissioner does not disapprove the distribution
    within 30 days of its filing. Under Rhode Island State
    Insurance Code, the Rhode Island Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock property and casualty insurance company would support the
    payment of such dividends to its shareholders.

Under Delaware State Insurance Law, Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company (“MTL”) is permitted, without prior
    insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to
    the Holding Company as long as the amount of the dividend when
    aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year
    (excluding realized capital gains). MTL will be permitted to pay
    a cash dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the greater
    of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration
    of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Delaware
    Commissioner”) and the Delaware Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined
    as unassigned funds) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under Delaware
    State Insurance Law, the Delaware Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Overview

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(r) using
    the modified prospective transition method. The adoption of
    SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial position or consolidated
    results of operations.

Description
    of Plans

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
    “Stock Incentive Plan”), authorized the granting of
    awards in the form of options to buy shares of Holding Company
    common stock (“Stock Options”) that either qualify as
    incentive Stock Options under Section 422A of the Internal
    Revenue Code or are non-qualified. The MetLife, Inc.
    2000 Directors Stock Plan, as amended (the “Directors
    Stock Plan”), authorized the granting of awards in the form
    of Performance Share awards, non-qualified Stock Options, or a
    combination of the foregoing to outside Directors of the Holding
    Company. Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive
    Compensation Plan, as amended (the “2005 Stock Plan”),
    awards granted may be in the form of Stock Options, Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
    Performance Shares or Performance Share Units, Cash-Based
    Awards, and Stock-Based Awards (each as defined in the 2005
    Stock Plan). Under the MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management
    Director Stock Compensation Plan (the “2005 Directors
    Stock Plan”), awards granted may be in the form of
    non-qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
    Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or Stock-Based
    Awards (each as defined in the 2005 Directors Stock Plan).
    The Stock Incentive Plan, Directors Stock Plan, 2005 Stock Plan,
    the 2005 Directors Stock Plan and the LTPCP, as described
    below, are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
    “Incentive Plans.”

The aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan and the LTPCP is 68,000,000, plus those shares
    available but not utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan and
    those shares utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan that are
    recovered due to forfeiture of Stock Options. Additional shares
    carried forward from the Stock Incentive Plan and available for
    issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan were 12,423,881 as of
    December 31, 2006. There were no shares carried forward
    from the Directors Stock Plan. Each share issued under the 2005
    Stock Plan in connection with a Stock Option or Stock
    Appreciation Right reduces the number of shares remaining for
    issuance under that plan by one, and each share issued under the
    2005 Stock Plan in connection with awards other than Stock
    Options or Stock Appreciation Rights reduces the number of
    shares remaining for issuance under that plan by
    1.179 shares. The number of shares reserved for issuance
    under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan are 2,000,000. As of
    December 31, 2006, the aggregate number of shares remaining
    available for issuance pursuant to the 2005 Stock Plan and the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan were 66,712,241 and 1,941,734,
    respectively.

Stock Option exercises and other stock-based awards to employees
    settled in shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares
    held in treasury by the Company. Under the current authorized
    share repurchase program, as described above, sufficient
    treasury shares exist to satisfy foreseeable obligations under
    the Incentive Plans.

Compensation expense related to awards under the Incentive Plans
    is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest,
    which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures
    over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant.
    Unless a material deviation from the assumed rate is observed
    during the term in which the awards are expensed, any adjustment
    necessary to reflect differences in actual experience is
    recognized in the period the award becomes payable or
    exercisable. Compensation expense of $144 million,
    $120 million and $89 million, and income tax benefits
    of $50 million, $42 million and $31 million,
    related to the Incentive Plans was recognized for the years
    ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
    Compensation expense is principally related to the issuance of
    Stock Options, Performance Shares and LTPCP arrangements.

As described in Note 1, the Company changed its policy
    prospectively for recognizing expense for stock-based awards to
    retirement eligible employees. Had the Company continued to
    recognize expense over the stated requisite service period,
    compensation expense related to the Incentive Plans would have
    been $116 million, $120 million and $89 million,
    rather than $144 million, $120 million and
    $89 million, for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Had the Company applied the policy
    of recognizing expense related to stock-based compensation over
    the shorter of the requisite service period or the period to
    attainment of retirement eligibility for awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, pro forma compensation expense would have
    been $120 million, $122 million and $94 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

All Stock Options granted had an exercise price equal to the
    closing price of the Holding Company’s stock as reported on
    the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and have a
    maximum term of ten years. Certain Stock Options granted under
    the Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Stock Plan have or will
    become exercisable over a three year period commencing with the
    date of grant, while other Stock Options have or will become
    exercisable three years after the date of grant. Stock Options
    issued under the Directors Stock Plan were exercisable
    immediately. The date at which a Stock Option issued under the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan becomes exercisable is determined
    at the time such Stock Option is granted.

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Black-Scholes model was used
    to determine the fair value of Stock Options granted and
    recognized in the financial statements or as reported in the pro
    forma disclosure which follows. The fair value of Stock Options
    issued on or after January 1, 2005 was estimated on the
    date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company made
    this change because lattice models produce more accurate option
    values due to the ability to incorporate assumptions about
    grantee exercise behavior resulting from changes in the price of
    the underlying shares. In addition, lattice models allow for
    changes in critical assumptions over the life of the option in
    comparison to closed-form models like Black-Scholes, which
    require single-value assumptions at the time of grant.

The Company used daily historical volatility since the inception
    of trading when calculating Stock Option values using the
    Black-Scholes model. In conjunction with the change to the
    binomial lattice model, the Company began estimating expected
    future volatility based upon an analysis of historical prices of
    the Holding Company’s common stock and call options on that
    common stock traded on the open market. The Company uses a
    weighted-average of the implied volatility for publicly traded
    call options with the longest remaining maturity nearest to the
    money as of each valuation date and the historical volatility,
    calculated using monthly closing prices of the Holding
    Company’s common stock. The Company chose a monthly
    measurement interval for historical volatility as it believes
    this better depicts the nature of employee option exercise
    decisions being based on longer-term trends in the price of the
    underlying shares rather than on daily price movements.

The risk-free rate is based on observed interest rates for
    instruments with maturities similar to the expected term of the
    Stock Options. Whereas the Black-Scholes model requires a single
    spot rate for instruments with a term matching the expected life
    of the option at the valuation date, the binomial lattice model
    allows for the use of different rates for each year over the
    contractual term of the option. The table below presents the
    full range of imputed forward rates for U.S. Treasury
    Strips that was used in the binomial lattice model over the
    contractual term of all Stock Options granted in the period.

Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend
    distributions compared to the price of the underlying common
    stock as of the valuation date and held constant over the life
    of the Stock Option.

Use of the Black-Scholes model requires an input of the expected
    life of the Stock Options, or the average number of years before
    Stock Options will be exercised or expired. The Company
    estimated expected life using the historical average years to
    exercise or cancellation and average remaining years outstanding
    for vested Stock

Options. Alternatively, the binomial model used by the Company
    incorporates the contractual term of the Stock Options and then
    considers expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting
    termination rate, or the rate at which vested options are
    exercised or expire prematurely due to termination of
    employment, to derive an expected life. The post-vesting
    termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise
    and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans. Exercise
    behavior in the binomial lattice model used by the Company is
    expressed using an exercise multiple, which reflects the ratio
    of exercise price to the strike price of Stock Options granted
    at which holders of the Stock Options are expected to exercise.
    The exercise multiple is derived from actual historical exercise
    activity.

The following weighted average assumptions, with the exception
    of risk-free rate, which is expressed as a range, were used to

Performance
    Shares

Beginning in 2005, certain members of management were awarded
    Performance Shares under (and as defined in) the 2005 Stock
    Plan. Participants are awarded an initial target number of
    Performance Shares with the final number of Performance Shares
    payable being determined by the product of the initial target
    multiplied by a factor of 0.0 to 2.0. The factor applied is
    based on measurements of the Holding Company’s performance
    with respect to: (i) the change in annual net operating
    earnings per share, as defined; and (ii) the proportionate
    total shareholder return, as defined, with reference to the
    three-year performance period relative to other companies in the
    S&P Insurance Index with reference to the same three-year
    period. Performance Share awards will normally vest in their
    entirety at the end of the three-year performance period
    (subject to certain contingencies) and will be payable entirely
    in shares of the Holding Company’s common stock.

    of the Performance Shares vested during the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Performance Share awards are accounted for as equity awards but
    are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends
    paid on the Holding Company’s common stock during the
    performance period. Accordingly, the fair value of Performance
    Shares is based upon the closing price of the Holding
    Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the
    present value of estimated dividends to be paid on that stock
    during the performance period.

Compensation expense related to initial Performance Shares
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is
    recognized ratably during the performance period. Compensation
    expense related to initial Performance Shares granted on or
    after January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is recognized
    ratably over the performance period or the period to retirement
    eligibility, if shorter. Performance Shares expected to vest and
    the related compensation expenses may be further adjusted by the
    performance factor most likely to be achieved, as estimated by
    management, at the end of the performance period. Compensation
    expense of $74 million and $24 million, related to
    Performance Shares was recognized for the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $59 million of
    total unrecognized compensation costs related to Performance
    Share awards. It is expected that these costs will be recognized
    over a weighted average period of 1.59 years.

Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Company granted stock-based
    compensation to certain members of management under the LTPCP.
    Each participant was assigned a target compensation amount (an
    “Opportunity Award”) at the inception of the
    performance period with the final compensation amount determined
    based on the total shareholder return on the Holding
    Company’s common stock over the three-year performance
    period, subject to limited further adjustment approved by the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors. Payments on the
    Opportunity Awards are normally payable in their entirety
    (subject to certain contingencies) at the end of the three-year
    performance period, and may be paid in whole or in part with
    shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, as approved
    by the Holding Company’s Board of Directors. There were no
    new grants under the LTPCP during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005.

A portion of each Opportunity Award under the LTPCP is expected
    to be settled in shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock while the remainder will be settled in cash. The portion
    of the Opportunity Award expected to be settled in shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock is accounted for as an
    equity award with the fair value of the award determined based
    upon the closing price of the Holding Company’s common
    stock on the date of grant. The compensation expense associated
    with the equity award, based upon the grant date fair value, is
    recognized into expense ratably over the respective three-year
    performance period. The portion of the Opportunity Award
    expected to be settled in cash is accounted for as a liability
    and is remeasured using the closing price of the

Holding Company’s common stock on the final day of each
    subsequent reporting period during the three-year performance
    period.

Compensation expense of $14 million, $46 million and
    $49 million, related to LTPCP Opportunity Awards was
    recognized for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively.

The aggregate fair value of LTPCP Opportunity Awards outstanding
    at December 31, 2006 was $41 million, all of which has
    been recognized. LTPCP Opportunity Awards with an aggregate fair
    value of $65 million vested during the year ended
    December 31, 2006, and settled in the form of
    906,989 shares and $16 million in cash. It is expected
    that approximately 760,000 additional shares and
    $15 million in cash will be issued in future settlement of
    LTPCP Opportunity Awards expected to become payable in the
    second quarter of 2007.

Statutory
    Equity and Income

Each insurance company’s state of domicile imposes minimum
    risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that were
    developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”). The formulas for determining the amount of
    RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to
    financial balances or various levels of activity based on the
    perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by
    a ratio of total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to
    authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC.
    Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified
    within certain levels, each of which requires specified
    corrective action. Each of the Holding Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum RBC
    requirements for all periods presented herein.

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001. Codification was
    intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to
    state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting
    principles continue to be established by individual state laws
    and permitted practices. Modifications by the various state
    insurance departments may impact the effect of Codification on
    the statutory capital and surplus of Metropolitan Life and the
    Holding Company’s other insurance subsidiaries.

Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by
    charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred,
    establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different
    actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus
    instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.

Statutory net income of Metropolitan Life, a New York domiciled
    insurer, was $1.0 billion, $2.2 billion and
    $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, as
    filed with the Department, was $9.2 billion and
    $8.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Due to the mergers of Paragon Life Insurance
    Company, Citicorp Life Insurance Company and First Citicorp Life
    Insurance Company with Metropolitan Life, the 2005 statutory net
    income and statutory capital and surplus balances were adjusted.

Statutory net income of MICC, a Connecticut domiciled insurer,
    was $749 million for the year ended December 31, 2006
    and $470 million from the date of purchase, for the six
    month period ended December 31, 2005. Statutory capital and
    surplus, as filed with the Connecticut Insurance Department, was
    $4.1 billion at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Statutory net income of MPC, a Rhode Island domiciled insurer,
    was $385 million, $289 million and $356 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. Statutory capital and surplus, as filed with the
    Insurance Department of Rhode Island, was $1.9 billion and
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Statutory net income of MTL, a Delaware domiciled insurer, was

Business
    Segment Information

The Company is a leading provider of insurance and other
    financial services with operations throughout the United States
    and the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. The
    Company’s business is divided into five operating segments:
    Institutional, Individual, Auto & Home, International
    and Reinsurance, as well as Corporate & Other. These
    segments are managed separately because they either provide
    different products and services, require different strategies or
    have different technology requirements.

In connection with the Travelers acquisition, management
    utilized its economic capital model to evaluate the deployment
    of capital based upon the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in the Company’s existing and newly acquired
    businesses and has adjusted such allocations based upon this
    model.

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.

Institutional offers a broad range of group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services, including
    group life insurance, non-medical health insurance, such as
    short and long-term disability, long-term care, and dental
    insurance, and other insurance products and services. Individual
    offers a wide variety of protection and asset accumulation
    products, including life insurance, annuities and mutual funds.
    Auto & Home provides personal lines property and
    casualty insurance, including private passenger automobile,
    homeowners and personal excess liability insurance.
    International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, annuities and retirement & savings products
    to both individuals and groups. Through the Company’s
    majority-owned subsidiary, RGA, the Reinsurance segment provides
    reinsurance of life and annuity policies in North America and
    various international markets. Additionally, reinsurance of
    critical illness policies is provided in select international
    markets.

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, various

start-up

entities, MetLife Bank and run-off entities, as well as interest
    expense related to the majority of the Company’s
    outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate &
    Other also includes the elimination of all intersegment amounts,
    which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear
    interest rates commensurate with related borrowings, as well as
    intersegment transactions. Additionally, the Company’s
    asset management business, including amounts reported as
    discontinued operations, is included in the results of
    operations for Corporate & Other. See Note 22 for
    disclosures regarding discontinued operations, including real
    estate.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information
    with respect to the Company’s segments, as well as
    Corporate & Other, for the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The accounting policies
    of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for
    the method of capital allocation and the accounting for gains
    (losses) from intercompany sales, which are eliminated in
    consolidation. The Company allocates equity to each segment
    based upon the economic capital model that allows the Company to
    effectively manage its capital. The Company evaluates the
    performance of each segment based upon net income excluding net
    investment gains (losses), net of income tax, adjustments
    related to net investment gains (losses), net of income tax, the
    impact from the cumulative effect of changes in accounting, net
    of income tax and discontinued operations, other than
    discontinued real estate, net of income tax, less preferred
    stock dividends. The Company allocates certain non-recurring
    items, such as expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings, to Corporate & Other.

Net investment income and net investment gains (losses) are
    based upon the actual results of each segment’s
    specifically identifiable asset portfolio adjusted for allocated
    equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based
    upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs;
    (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee
    compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost
    estimates included in the Company’s product pricing.

Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of
    consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,
    2006, 2005 and 2004. Revenues from U.S. operations were
    $42.0 billion, $39.5 billion and $34.8 billion
    for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively, which represented 87%, 88% and 90%, respectively,
    of consolidated revenues.

On January 31, 2005, the Company completed the sale of SSRM
    to a third party for $328 million in cash and stock. As a
    result of the sale of SSRM, the Company recognized income from
    discontinued operations of $157 million, net of income tax,
    comprised of a realized gain of $165 million, net of income
    tax, and an operating expense related to a lease abandonment of
    $8 million, net of income tax. Under the terms of the sale
    agreement, MetLife will have an opportunity to receive
    additional payments based on, among other things, certain
    revenue retention and growth measures. The purchase price is
    also subject to reduction over five years, depending on
    retention of certain MetLife-related business. Also under the
    terms of such agreement, MetLife had the opportunity to receive
    additional consideration for the retention of certain customers
    for a specific period in 2005. Upon finalization of the
    computation, the Company received payments of $30 million,
    net of income tax, in the second quarter of 2006 and
    $12 million, net of income tax, in the fourth quarter of
    2005 due to the retention of these specific customer accounts.
    In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company eliminated
    $4 million of a liability that was previously recorded with
    respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale
    of SSRM, resulting in a benefit to the Company of
    $2 million, net of income tax. The Company believes that
    future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable.

The Company reported the operations of SSRM in discontinued
    operations. Additionally, the sale of SSRM resulted in the
    elimination of the Company’s Asset Management segment. The
    remaining asset management business, which is insignificant, is
    reported in Corporate & Other. The Company’s
    discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
    2005 included expenses of $6 million, net of income tax,
    related to the sale of SSRM.

Fair
    Value Information

The estimated fair value of financial instruments have been
    determined by using available market information and the
    valuation methodologies described below. Considerable judgment
    is often required in interpreting market data to develop
    estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented
    herein may not necessarily be indicative of amounts that could
    be realized in a current market exchange. The use of different
    assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

Fixed
    Maturity Securities, Trading Securities and Equity
    Securities

The fair values of publicly held fixed maturity securities and
    publicly held equity securities are based on quoted market
    prices or estimates from independent pricing services. However,
    in cases where quoted market prices are not available, such as
    for private fixed maturity securities, fair values are estimated
    using present value or valuation techniques. The determination
    of fair values is based on: (i) valuation methodologies;
    (ii) securities the Company deems to be comparable; and
    (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates based on available
    market information and judgments about financial instruments,
    including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future
    cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or
    counterparty. Factors considered in estimating fair value
    include; coupon rate, maturity, estimated duration, call
    provisions, sinking fund requirements, credit rating, industry
    sector of the issuer, and quoted market prices of comparable
    securities.

Mortgage
    and Consumer Loans, Mortgage Loan Commitments and
    Commitments to Fund Bank Credit Facilities and Bridge
    Loans

Fair values for mortgage and consumer loans are estimated by
    discounting expected future cash flows, using current interest
    rates for similar loans with similar credit risk. For mortgage
    loan commitments and commitments to fund bank credit facilities
    and bridge loans, the estimated fair value is the net premium or
    discount of the commitments.

F-121


METLIFE,
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Policy
    Loans

The carrying values for policy loans approximate fair value.

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

The carrying values for cash and cash equivalents and short-term
    investments approximated fair values due to the short-term
    maturities of these instruments.

Accrued
    Investment Income

The carrying value for accrued investment income approximates
    fair value.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

The fair value of PABs which have final contractual maturities
    are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows based
    upon interest rates currently being offered for similar
    contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for
    the agreements being valued. The fair value of PABs without
    final contractual maturities are assumed to equal their current
    net surrender value.

Short-term
    and Long-term Debt, Junior Subordinated Debt Securities and
    Shares Subject to Mandatory Redemption

The fair values of short-term and long-term debt, junior
    subordinated debt securities

,

and shares subject
    to mandatory redemption are determined by discounting expected
    future cash flows using risk rates currently available for debt
    with similar terms and remaining maturities.

Payables
    for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

The carrying value for payables for collateral under securities
    loaned and other transactions approximate fair value.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The fair value of derivative financial instruments, including
    financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate, credit
    default and foreign currency swaps, foreign currency forwards,
    caps, floors, and options are based upon quotations obtained
    from dealers or other reliable sources. See Note 4 for
    derivative fair value disclosures.

Subsequent
    Events

On February 27, 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock
    repurchase program. See Note 17 for further information.

On February 16, 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of
    Directors announced dividends of $0.3975000 per share, for
    a total of $10 million, on its Series A preferred
    shares, and $0.4062500 per share, for a total of
    $24 million, on its Series B preferred shares, subject
    to the final confirmation that it has met the financial tests
    specified in the Series A and Series B preferred
    shares, which the Holding Company anticipates will be made on or
    about March 5, 2007, the earliest date permitted in
    accordance with the terms of the securities. Both dividends will
    be payable March 15, 2007 to shareholders of record as of
    February 28, 2007.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“Metropolitan
    Life”). MetLife, Inc. is a leading provider of insurance
    and other financial services with operations throughout the
    United States and the regions of Latin America, Europe, and Asia
    Pacific. Through its domestic and international subsidiaries and
    affiliates, MetLife, Inc. offers life insurance, annuities,
    automobile and homeowners insurance, retail banking and other
    financial services to individuals, as well as group insurance,
    reinsurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions.

On July 1, 2005, the Holding Company completed the
    acquisition of The Travelers Insurance Company, excluding
    certain assets, most significantly, Primerica, from Citigroup
    Inc. (“Citigroup”), and substantially all of
    Citigroup’s international insurance businesses
    (collectively, “Travelers”), for $12.1 billion.
    The results of Travelers’ operations were included in the
    Company’s financial statements beginning July 1, 2005.
    As a result of the acquisition, management of the Company
    increased significantly the size and scale of the Company’s
    core insurance and annuity products and expanded the
    Company’s presence in both the retirement &
    savings domestic and international markets. The distribution
    agreements executed with Citigroup as part of the acquisition
    provide the Company with one of the broadest distribution
    networks in the industry. The initial consideration paid by the
    Holding Company for the acquisition consisted of
    $10.9 billion in cash and 22,436,617 shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock with a market value of
    $1.0 billion to Citigroup and $100 million in other
    transaction costs. Additional consideration of $115 million
    was paid by the Holding Company to Citigroup in 2006 In addition
    to cash on-hand, the purchase price was financed through the
    issuance of common stock, debt securities, common equity units
    and preferred stock.

Basis
    of Presentation

The condensed financial information of the Holding Company
    (“Parent Company Only”) should be read in conjunction
    with the Consolidated Financial Statements of MetLife, Inc. and
    subsidiaries and the notes thereto (the “Consolidated
    Financial Statements”). These condensed nonconsolidated
    financial statements reflect the results of operations,
    financial condition and cash flows for the parent company only.
    Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

The condensed unconsolidated financial statements are prepared
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) except as stated
    above which also requires management to make certain estimates
    and assumptions. The most important of these estimates and
    assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the
    accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and
    the provision for potential losses that may arise from
    litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may
    affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates.

    and 2010, which it shares with MetLife Funding, Inc.
    (“MetLife Funding”)) as of December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2006,
    the Holding Company had $970 million in outstanding letters
    of credit from various banks. Since commitments associated with
    letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire unused,

Dividends

The primary source of the Holding Company’s liquidity is
    dividends it receives from its insurance subsidiaries. The
    Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by
    the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend
    limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is based on the
    surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding
    calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year. The maximum aggregate
    amount of dividends which the Holding Company subsidiaries may
    pay to the Holding Company in 2007 is $1,729 million.

Support
    Agreements

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level risk-based capital
    (“RBC”), as defined by state insurance statutes, and
    liquidity necessary to enable it to meet its current obligations
    on a timely basis. As of the date of the most recent statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the
    capital and surplus of each of these subsidiaries was in excess
    of the minimum capital and surplus amounts referenced above, and
    their total adjusted capital was in excess of the most recent
    referenced RBC-based amount calculated at December 31, 2006.

In connection with the acquisition of Travelers, the Holding
    Company committed to the South Carolina Department of Insurance
    to take necessary action to maintain the minimum capital and
    surplus of MetLife Reinsurance Company of South Carolina,
    formerly The Travelers Life and Annuity Reinsurance Company, at
    the greater of $250,000 or 10% of net loss reserves (loss
    reserves less deferred policy acquisition costs).

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns approximately 50% of the equity. Under the
    agreement, the Holding Company agreed, without limitation as to
    amount, to cause MSMIC to have the amount of capital and surplus
    necessary for MSMIC to maintain a solvency ratio of at least
    400%, as calculated in accordance with the Insurance Business
    Law of Japan, and to make such loans to MSMIC as may be
    necessary to ensure that MSMIC has sufficient cash or other
    liquid assets to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
    As of the date of the most recent calculation, the capital and
    surplus of MSMIC was in excess of the minimum capital and
    surplus amount referenced above.

Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

There were no changes to the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,
    estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
    expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The
    objectives of internal control include providing management with
    reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are
    safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,
    and that transactions are executed in accordance with
    management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit

In the opinion of management, MetLife, Inc. maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public

Attestation
    Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their
    attestation report on management’s assessment of internal
    control over financial reporting which is set forth below.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
    management’s annual report on internal control over
    financial reporting, as included in Item 9A.

Controls
    and Procedures,

that MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
    assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    of the Company, and our report dated March 1, 2007,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules and included an
    explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s change in its
    method of accounting for defined benefit pension and other
    postretirement plans as required by accounting guidance which
    the Company adopted on December 31, 2006.
