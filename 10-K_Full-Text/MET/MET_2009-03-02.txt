Overview

    Market and Economic Events Impacting Our Business

The U.S. and global financial markets experienced
    extraordinary dislocations during 2008, especially in the second
    half of the year, producing challenges for our company and the
    financial services industry generally. Concerns which had
    originally arisen over the value of subprime mortgage loans
    backing certain classes of mortgage-backed securities and other
    financial products and investment vehicles spread during the
    year to the financial services sector as a whole, as investors
    questioned the asset quality and capital strength of banks and
    other financial institutions that held these investments or were
    otherwise exposed to them. Beginning in the summer and
    continuing through the end of the year, these concerns in turn
    led to a dramatic increase in credit spreads,



particularly in the financial sector, and sharp drops in the
    market value of a wide range of financial instruments. Concerns
    over the creditworthiness of banks and other financial
    institutions also led to a severe contraction in lending
    activity, both among financial institutions and more generally,
    as lenders sought to increase their own liquidity to bolster
    their ability to withstand the stresses in the financial markets
    and to protect themselves against the loss of credit from other
    institutions. Many investors reduced or eliminated their
    holdings of asset-backed and corporate securities and purchased
    Treasury securities and other securities viewed as offering
    greater liquidity and credit quality, while investors in hedge
    funds and other collective investment vehicles sought to redeem
    their investments, requiring the funds to sell assets to satisfy
    redemption requests. During the third quarter and especially the
    fourth quarter, trading markets for certain kinds of financial
    instruments contracted severely or dried up altogether, further
    contributing to price declines, while concerns over the health
    of the economy and the possibility of defaults and bankruptcies
    also weighed on the value of debt securities. The application of
    fair value accounting principles in conditions of a dislocated
    market and low levels of liquidity brought into question the
    accuracy of fair valuations of certain securities.

As the crisis worsened, a number of significant, well-known
    financial institutions failed or required extraordinary
    government assistance to keep from failing. Investor concerns
    over the financial strength and solvency of financial
    institutions and the impact of the credit crisis on the economy
    also resulted in sharp declines in equity prices both within the
    financial services sector and in the broader stock market,
    especially in the last third of the year. The
    Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 37% during the
    year, with the most dramatic declines occurring in the second
    half, and volatility of stock prices reached extraordinarily
    high levels. The stock prices of major life insurance companies,
    including ours, registered sharp declines, especially in the
    fourth quarter, driven by investor concerns over the quality of
    their investment assets, exposures to guarantees that protect
    the customer against declines in equity markets and their
    overall liquidity and financial strength.

Interest rates dropped significantly during the year and the
    yield curve grew steeper. The Federal Funds rate fell from 4.25%
    at the beginning of 2008 to a range of 0.0% to 0.25% at the end
    of 2008, while the yield on ten-year Treasury obligations
    decreased from 3.91% at the beginning of the year to 2.25% at
    the end of the year.

The financial market stress and concerns over economic weakness
    led the United States government and governments around the
    world to take unprecedented actions to shore up their economies
    and financial markets, including, in the United States, the
    reduction of the Federal Funds rate, a series of increasingly
    aggressive actions by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity
    and avert failures of major financial institutions, the
    enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 in
    October and the enactment of the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act, an economic stimulus bill, in February 2009. A
    number of foreign governments also took actions to support their
    economies and banking systems, while in Argentina the government
    nationalized their private pension system.

The stress in the financial markets and the impact of certain of
    these government stimulus measures may result in inflation or
    deflation, although at this point the ultimate outcome cannot be
    predicted.

During the second half of the year, the value of the dollar
    appreciated sharply against the British pound, the Euro, the
    Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies relevant to our
    operations, including the Mexican peso and the Korean won, while
    depreciating substantially against the Japanese yen.

Late in 2008, the National Bureau of Economic Research announced
    that the United States economy was in a recession that had
    started in December 2007. Globally, economic growth declined
    from 5.2% in 2007 to an estimated 3.4% in 2008, and is currently
    predicted to fall to 0.5% in 2009. In the United States,
    economic growth fell from 2.3% in 2007 to an estimated -0.2% in
    2008, and is currently projected to decline to -2.0% in 2009.
    Unemployment rose during 2008 from just below 5% at the
    beginning of the year to 7.6% at the end of 2008 with
    unemployment forecasted to rise to above 8.5% by the end of 2009.

Impact
    of 2008 Market and Economic Events on Our Business

The financial market movements and economic events of 2008 had a
    significant impact on our results for the year. The impacts of
    the credit and equity markets had the most significant impact
    with the recession beginning to impact our business fundamentals.



Credit Market Impacts.

The widening of credit
    spreads on corporate debt instruments and concerns over the
    quality of assets underlying various mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities resulted in significant declines in the
    market value of many investment assets and a substantial
    increase in our gross unrealized losses on investments,
    especially in the third and fourth quarters. The conditions of
    reduced liquidity that prevailed toward the end of 2008
    presented challenges in determining when a decline in the market
    price of a security was due to reduced liquidity or an actual
    deterioration in creditworthiness of the issuer. As described
    below, we recognized impairment charges when we made a
    determination that the decline in market value of our
    investments was other than temporary. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments.”

Equity Market Impacts.

Declines in the equity
    markets had a number of significant effects on our results.
    First, these declines increased the costs of guaranteed minimum
    benefits on certain annuity contracts, which led to increases in
    policyholder benefits and claims in our Individual segment and
    caused significant losses on embedded derivatives in our
    Individual and International segments, which are reflected in
    net investment gains and losses as discussed in greater detail
    below. We have put in place freestanding derivatives to hedge
    our economic exposure to these embedded derivatives. In
    addition, equity market declines reduced separate account
    values, resulting in a decrease in fee income and an increase in
    amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs within our
    Individual segment. See “— Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Policyholder Liabilities; Summary of
    Critical Accounting Estimates — Deferred Policy
    Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired;” and
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Results of Operations.”

Foreign Currency Impacts.

The appreciation of
    the dollar against other currencies in the second half of 2008,
    especially the British pound, the Euro and the Canadian dollar,
    had the effect of reducing our liabilities and assets for
    obligations denominated in those currencies. The appreciation of
    the dollar against the Mexican peso and the Korean won tended to
    reduce our equity in and net income from our international
    operations when translated back into dollars. In the case of the
    Japanese yen, the depreciation of the dollar in the second half
    of the year had the effect of increasing our losses on embedded
    derivatives associated with certain variable annuities when
    translated into dollars. We use derivatives to manage our
    exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31,
    2008 compared with the Year Ended December 31,
    2007 — The Company — Revenues and
    Expenses — Net Investment Gains and Losses” and
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    International.”

Impact on Net Investment Gains (Losses).

We
    recognized substantial gains on freestanding derivatives that we
    entered into to hedge our exposures to interest rate risk,
    foreign currency exchange rate risk and equity price risk. These
    derivative gains outweighed the losses on embedded derivatives
    related to guaranteed minimum benefits on variable annuities
    (which would have been larger if not offset by adjustments due
    to the widening of our own credit spread as described below) and
    losses on fixed maturity and equity securities (which were
    primarily driven by impairments on holdings of financial
    institutions) and resulted in significant net investment gains
    for the year. See “— Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Results of Operations — Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007 — The Company —
    Revenues and Expenses — Net Investment Gains and
    Losses.”

Impact of Credit Spread Widening and Fair Value
    Accounting.

The widening of our own credit spread
    in the third and fourth quarters had a beneficial effect on our
    results, particularly in our Individual and International
    segments, by dampening the impact of declines in equity market
    prices on the valuation of our embedded derivatives associated
    with guarantees on variable annuities. The substantial decreases
    in equity prices during the year increased the liability for
    guaranteed minimum benefits on variable annuities, which is
    reflected as a loss on embedded derivatives in net investment
    gains and losses. Because we carry that liability at fair value
    under SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

(“SFAS 157”), which we adopted effective
    January 1, 2008, we take our own credit spread into account
    in determining the fair value. The widening of our own credit
    spread during 2008 substantially reduced the amount of the loss
    on embedded derivatives. A narrowing of our own credit spread in
    the future could result in net investment losses as the
    derivative gain is reduced. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31,



2008 compared with the Year Ended December 31,
    2007 — The Company — Revenues and
    Expenses — Net Investment Gains and Losses.”

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligation
    Impacts.

The dramatic deterioration in the credit
    and equity markets produced significant declines in the market
    value of the assets supporting our pension and postretirement
    benefit plan obligations, resulting in changes in the funded
    status of such plans which will affect our results of operations
    in 2009. See “— Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans.”

Goodwill Impacts.

In addition to our annual
    goodwill impairment tests performed during the third quarter of
    2008 based upon data as of June 30, 2008, we performed an
    interim goodwill impairment test as of December 31, 2008,
    in light of current economic conditions, the sustained low level
    of equity markets, declining market capitalizations in the
    insurance industry and lower operating earnings projections,
    particularly for the Individual segment. Based upon the tests
    performed, management concluded no impairment of goodwill had
    occurred for any of the Company’s reporting units at
    December 31, 2008. See “— Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Goodwill.”

Impact on Net Investment Income.

Investment
    yields declined in many asset classes, principally other limited
    partnerships (including hedge funds), real estate joint
    ventures, cash and short-term investments, and mortgage loans,
    causing net investment income to decrease from 2007 levels. Our
    results on securities lending were higher than in the prior
    year. See “— Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Results of Operations — Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007 — The Company —
    Revenues and Expenses — Net Investment Income.”

Business Fundamentals and Other
    Events.

Although financial market factors had the
    largest impact on our performance in 2008, some factors not
    related to financial market developments also affected our
    results. Top-line growth was strong, with particularly large
    increases in premiums, fees and other revenues in our
    Institutional segment and our International segment. Net
    interest margins decreased in our Individual segment and in the
    retirement & savings business in our Institutional
    segment but increased in the group life business of
    Institutional. Less favorable underwriting results than in 2007
    affected our Institutional and Individual segments, while the
    Auto & Home segment was impacted by increased
    catastrophe losses compared to 2007. The effects of pension
    reform in Argentina in 2007 and the nationalization of the
    Argentine pension business in 2008 affected our International
    results. In Corporate & Other, results were affected
    by increases in revenues and expenses resulting from the growth
    of MetLife Bank, National Association (“MetLife Bank”
    or “MetLife Bank, N.A.”) and increased expenses
    associated with implementation of an enterprise-wide cost
    reduction and revenue enhancement initiative, higher corporate
    support expenses and increased interest expense. During 2008, we
    also completed the split-off of our majority ownership stake in
    Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Results of Operations — Year Ended December 31,
    2008 compared with the Year Ended December 31,
    2007 — The Company.”

Securities Lending Program.

As institutional
    investors sought greater liquidity during the third and fourth
    quarter of 2008 in response to the turbulent credit markets and
    financial institution crisis, we systematically reduced the size
    of our securities lending program in-line with demand. The drop
    in the securities lending volume was more than offset, however,
    by an increase in the rates charged for securities lending
    transactions. See “— Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Liquidity Position.

We purposefully enhanced
    own liquidity position in the second half of the year by holding
    historically high levels of cash, cash equivalents and
    short-term investments, which further pressured net investment
    income with the substantial decline in short-term interest rates
    over the year. To manage liquidity across our businesses we
    utilized intersegment transfers of assets rather than selling
    assets into the marketplace and we have participated, to a
    limited extent, in certain of the government programs. We are
    managing our increased levels of liquidity and their impact on
    the matching of our assets and liabilities through our well
    established asset/liability management processes. For a
    comprehensive description of the impact of 2008 events on our
    liquidity see “— Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Extraordinary Market Conditions.”



Capital Transactions.

In the midst of these
    extraordinary market conditions, we were able to raise capital
    through offerings of common stock and senior debt. In October
    2008, we issued 86,250,000 shares of common stock at a
    price of $26.50 per share for gross proceeds of
    $2.3 billion in order to strengthen our capital position
    and increase our cushion against potential realized and
    unrealized losses. In August 2008 and February 2009, we
    successfully remarketed a total of $2,070 million of
    ten-year senior debt, with coupon rates of 6.817% for notes
    maturing in August 2018 and 7.717% for notes maturing in
    February 2019. The proceeds of both remarketings were used to
    satisfy holders’ obligations to purchase common stock of
    the Company under the stock purchase contracts forming part of
    our common equity units issued in 2005. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Ratings.

Rating agencies continue to monitor
    insurance companies, including ours, as described in
    “— Company Ratings.”

Continuing
    Effects of Market and Economic Conditions on Our
    Business

During 2009, management expects that the United States and
    international economies will continue to feel the impact of the
    extraordinary economic and financial market movements and events
    of 2008, with a continuation of financial market volatility, as
    the effects of recession on our business become more pronounced.
    More specifically, management anticipates the following impacts
    on MetLife’s businesses in 2009:

•

a modest increase (on a constant exchange rate basis) in
    premiums, fees and other revenues in 2009, with mixed results
    across MetLife’s segments, including (i) lower fee
    income from separate accounts businesses, including variable
    annuity and life products in the Individual segment; (ii) a
    possible decline in payroll-linked revenue from the
    Institutional segment’s group insurance customers;
    (iii) a reduction in the demand for certain retirement and
    savings products from the International and Institutional
    segments; and (iv) as a result of the impact of the
    recession on the housing market and the auto industry, a
    decrease in premiums from the Auto and Home segment;

•

continued downward pressure on net income across the enterprise,
    specifically net investment income, resulting from lower returns
    from other limited partnerships, real estate joint ventures and
    securities lending and ongoing uncertainty over the direction of
    interest rates, together with difficulty predicting the impact
    of the financial markets on net investment gains (losses) and
    unrealized investment gains (losses), as well as the effects of
    MetLife’s own credit, as it varies greatly and the exposure
    is not hedged;

•

the potential need to establish additional insurance-related
    liabilities, both those associated with guarantees (which are
    offset to some extent through hedging) and those not; and

•

the possible increase in certain expenses, including those
    associated with (i) the Company’s Operational
    Excellence initiative; (ii) impairments to goodwill,
    specifically in the Individual segment; (iii) the
    Company’s pension-related expense and (iv) DAC
    amortization.

In response to the challenges presented by the unusual economic
    environment, management continues to focus on disciplined
    underwriting, pricing and hedging strategies, as well as focused
    expense management.

The ongoing financial turbulence and the governmental responses
    have affected the competitive environment and may lead to
    consolidation within the life insurance industry as well as
    further consolidation in the broader financial services
    industry. The precise impacts of such events on our business are
    difficult to predict.

A more detailed discussion of management’s view of the
    outlook for 2009 for each of the Company’s operating
    segments and for Corporate & Other appears in
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Results of Operations — Outlook.”

Institutional

Our Institutional segment offers a broad range of group
    insurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions and their
    respective employees. We have built a leading position in the
    U.S. group insurance market through long-standing
    relationships with many of the largest corporate employers in
    the United States.



Group insurance products and services include group life
    insurance, non-medical health insurance products and related
    administrative services, as well as other benefits and services,
    such as employer-sponsored auto and homeowners insurance
    provided through the Auto & Home segment and prepaid
    legal services plans. Non-medical health insurance is comprised
    of products such as accidental death and dismemberment
    (“AD&D”), long-term care (“LTC”),
    short- and long-term disability, individual disability income,
    dental insurance, and prepaid legal services. We offer group
    insurance products as employer-paid benefits or as voluntary
    benefits where all or a portion of the premiums are paid by the
    employee. Revenues applicable to these group insurance products
    and services were $16 billion and $14 billion, in 2008
    and 2007, respectively, representing 31% and 30% of our total
    revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Our retirement & savings products and services include
    an array of annuity and investment products, including,
    guaranteed interest products and other stable value products,
    accumulation and income annuities, and separate account
    contracts for the investment management of defined benefit and
    defined contribution plan assets. Revenues applicable to our
    retirement & savings products were $8 billion in
    both 2008 and 2007 representing 16% and 17% of our total
    revenues in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Institutional segment markets our products and services
    through sales forces, comprised of MetLife employees, for both
    our group insurance and retirement & savings lines.

We distribute our group insurance products and services through
    a sales force that is segmented by the size of the target
    customer. Marketing representatives sell either directly to
    Corporate & Other institutional customers or through
    an intermediary, such as a broker or consultant. Voluntary
    products are sold through the same sales channels, as well as by
    specialists for these products. Employers have been emphasizing
    such voluntary products and, as a result, we have increased our
    focus on communicating and marketing to such employees in order
    to further foster sales of those products. As of
    December 31, 2008, the group insurance sales channels had
    357 marketing representatives, which represented a decrease of
    10% from 398 marketing representatives as of the end of the
    prior year.

Our retirement & savings organization markets
    retirement, savings, investment and payout annuity products and
    services to sponsors and advisors of benefit plans of all sizes.
    These products and services are offered to private and public
    pension plans, collective bargaining units, nonprofit
    organizations, recipients of structured settlements and the
    current and retired members of these and other institutions.

We distribute retirement & savings products and
    services through dedicated sales teams and relationship managers
    located in 9 offices around the country. In addition, the
    retirement & savings organization works with the
    distribution channels in the Individual segment and in the group
    insurance area to better reach and service customers, brokers,
    consultants and other intermediaries.

We have entered into several joint ventures and other
    arrangements with third parties to expand the marketing and
    distribution opportunities of institutional products and
    services. We also seek to sell our institutional products and
    services through sponsoring organizations and affinity groups.
    For example, we are the provider of LTC products for the
    National Long-Term Care Coalition, a group of some of the
    nation’s largest employers. In addition, the Company,
    together with John Hancock Financial Services, Inc., a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Manulife Financial Corporation, is a
    provider for the Federal Long-Term Care Insurance program. The
    program, available to most federal employees and their families,
    is the largest employer-sponsored LTC insurance program in the
    country based on the number of enrollees. In addition, we also
    provide life and dental coverage to federal employees.

    care (LTC) insurance products offered by our Institutional
    segment, investment products such as mutual funds and wealth
    advisory services, as well as other products offered by our
    other businesses.

Our broadly recognized brand names and strong distribution
    channels have allowed us to become the second largest provider
    of individual life insurance and annuities in the United States,
    with $17 billion of total statutory individual life and
    annuity premiums and deposits through September 30, 2008,
    the latest period for which OneSource, a database that
    aggregates United States insurance company statutory financial
    statements, is available. According to research performed by the
    Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association
    (“LIMRA”), based on sales through September 30,
    2008, we are the sixth largest issuer of individual variable
    life insurance in the United States and the fifth largest issuer
    of all individual life insurance products in the United States.
    In addition, according to research done by LIMRA and based on
    new annuity deposits through September 30, 2008, we are the
    third largest annuity writer in the United States.

During the period from 2004 to 2008, our first year statutory
    deposits for life products increased at a compound annual growth
    rate of approximately 1%. Life deposits represented
    approximately 28% and 32% of total statutory premiums and
    deposits for Individual in 2008 and 2007, respectively. During
    the period from 2004 to 2008, the statutory deposits for annuity
    products increased at a compound annual growth rate of
    approximately 14%. Annuity deposits represented approximately
    72% and 68% of total statutory premiums and deposits for
    Individual in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Individual had
    $15.6 billion and $15.4 billion of total revenues, or
    31% and 33% of our total revenues, in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. These premiums, deposits and revenues can and will
    fluctuate with market volatility as noted and discussed in the
    Risk Factors section of this document.

In 2008 we realigned resources, which did not change our product
    reporting groups, into the “Life and Protection Solutions
    Group,” the “Retirement and Wealth Strategies
    Group,” the “Individual Distribution” group, and
    the “Strategic Architecture & Business
    Performance” group. In this new organizational structure,
    we will focus



even more on the key factors that will ensure continued
    success — growing markets, profitable products,
    diverse distribution and efficient management of our resources.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Our Individual segment targets the large middle-income market,
    as well as affluent individuals, owners of small businesses and
    executives of small- to medium-sized companies. We have also
    been successful in selling our products in various

    MetLife’s Individual Distribution organization and also
    through various third party organizations utilizing two models.
    In the coverage model, wholesalers sell to high net worth
    individuals and small- to medium-sized businesses through
    independent general agencies, financial advisors, consultants,
    brokerage general agencies and other independent marketing
    organizations under contractual arrangements. In the point of
    sale model, wholesalers sell through financial intermediaries,
    including regional broker dealers, brokerage firms, financial

Products

We offer a wide variety of individual insurance, as well as
    annuities and investment-type products, aimed at serving our
    customers’ financial needs throughout their entire life
    cycle.

Life and
    Protection Solution Products

Our individual insurance products include variable life
    products, universal life products, traditional life products,
    including whole life and term life, and other individual
    products, including individual disability and LTC insurance.

We continually review and update our products. We have
    introduced new products and features designed to increase the
    competitiveness of our portfolio and the flexibility of our
    products to meet the broad range of asset accumulation,
    life-cycle protection and distribution needs of our customers.



Variable Life.

Variable life products provide
    insurance coverage through a contract that gives the
    policyholder flexibility in investment choices and, depending on
    the product, in premium payments and coverage amounts, with
    certain guarantees. Most importantly, with variable life
    products, premiums and account balances can be directed by the
    policyholder into a variety of separate accounts or directed to
    the Company’s general account. In the separate accounts,
    the policyholder bears the entire risk of the investment
    results. We collect specified fees for the management of these
    various investment accounts and any net return is credited
    directly to the policyholder’s account. In some instances,
    third-party money management firms manage investment accounts
    that support variable insurance products. With some products, by
    maintaining a certain premium level, policyholders may have the
    advantage of various guarantees that may protect the death
    benefit from adverse investment experience.

Universal Life.

Universal life products
    provide insurance coverage on the same basis as variable life,
    except that premiums, and the resulting accumulated balances,
    are allocated only to the Company’s general account.
    Universal life products may allow the insured to increase or
    decrease the amount of death benefit coverage over the term of
    the contract and the owner to adjust the frequency and amount of
    premium payments. We credit premiums to an account maintained
    for the policyholder. Premiums are credited net of specified
    expenses and interest, at interest rates we determine, subject
    to specified minimums. Specific charges are made against the
    policyholder’s account for the cost of insurance protection
    and for expenses. With some products, by maintaining a certain
    premium level, policyholders may have the advantage of various
    guarantees that may protect the death benefit from adverse
    investment experience.

Whole Life.

Whole life products provide a
    guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured in return for
    the periodic payment of a fixed premium over a predetermined
    period. Premium payments may be required for the entire life of
    the contract period, to a specified age or period, and may be
    level or change in accordance with a predetermined schedule.
    Whole life insurance includes policies that provide a
    participation feature in the form of dividends. Policyholders
    may receive dividends in cash or apply them to increase death
    benefits, increase cash values available upon surrender or
    reduce the premiums required to maintain the contract in-force.
    Because the use of dividends is specified by the policyholder,
    this group of products provides significant flexibility to
    individuals to tailor the product to suit their specific needs
    and circumstances, while at the same time providing guaranteed
    benefits.

Term Life.

Term life provides a guaranteed
    benefit upon the death of the insured for a specified time
    period in return for the periodic payment of premiums. Specified
    coverage periods range from one year to 30 years, but in no
    event are they longer than the period over which premiums are
    paid. Death benefits may be level over the period or decreasing.
    Decreasing coverage is used principally to provide for loan
    repayment in the event of death. Premiums may be guaranteed at a
    level amount for the coverage period or may be non-level and
    non-guaranteed. Term insurance products are sometimes referred
    to as pure protection products, in that there are typically no
    savings or investment elements. Term contracts expire without
    value at the end of the coverage period when the insured party
    is still living.

Other Individual Products.

Individual
    disability products provide a benefit in the event of the
    disability of the insured. In most instances, this benefit is in
    the form of monthly income paid until the insured reaches
    age 65. In addition to income replacement, the product may
    be used to provide for the payment of business overhead expenses
    for disabled business owners or mortgage payment protection.

Our LTC insurance provides a fixed benefit for certain costs
    associated with nursing home care and other services that may be
    provided to individuals unable to perform certain activities of
    daily living.

In addition to these products, our Individual segment supports a
    group of low face amount life insurance policies, known as
    industrial policies that its agents sold until 1964.

Retirement
    and Wealth Strategies Products

We offer a variety of individual annuities and investment
    products, including variable and fixed annuities, and mutual
    funds and securities.



Variable Annuities.

We offer variable
    annuities for both asset accumulation and asset distribution
    needs. Variable annuities allow the contractholder to make
    deposits into various investment accounts, as determined by the
    contractholder. The investment accounts are separate accounts
    and risks associated with such investments are borne entirely by
    the contractholder. In certain variable annuity products,
    contractholders may also choose to allocate all or a portion of
    their account to the Company’s general account and are
    credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain
    minimums. In addition, contractholders may also elect certain
    minimum death benefit and minimum living benefit guarantees for
    which additional fees are charged.

Fixed Annuities.

Fixed annuities are used for
    both asset accumulation and asset distribution needs. Fixed
    annuities do not allow the same investment flexibility provided
    by variable annuities, but provide guarantees related to the
    preservation of principal and interest credited. Deposits made
    into deferred annuity contracts are allocated to the
    Company’s general account and are credited with interest at
    rates we determine, subject to certain minimums. Credited
    interest rates are guaranteed not to change for certain limited
    periods of time, ranging from one to ten years. Fixed income
    annuities provide a guaranteed monthly income for a specified
    period of years

and/or

for
    the life of the annuitant.

Mutual Funds and Securities.

Through our
    broker-dealer affiliates, we offer a full range of mutual funds
    and other securities products.

International

International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, credit insurance, annuities, endowment and
    retirement & savings products to both individuals and
    groups. We focus on emerging markets primarily within the Latin
    America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. We operate in
    international markets through subsidiaries and joint ventures.
    See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could
    Negatively Affect Our Profitability,” and “Risk
    Factors — Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability,” and
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Latin
    America

We operate in the Latin America region in the following
    countries: Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The
    operations in Mexico and Chile represented 82% of the total
    premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The Mexican operation is the largest
    life insurance company in both the individual and group
    businesses in Mexico. The Chilean operation is the largest
    annuity company in Chile, based on market share. The Chilean
    operation also offers individual life insurance and group
    insurance products. In 2008, our Argentine pension business,
    which was the second largest in the market ceased to exist as a
    result of the nationalization of the private pension system by
    the Argentine government. We also actively market individual
    life insurance, group insurance products and credit life
    coverage in Argentina, but the nationalization of the pension
    system substantially reduces our presence in Argentina. The
    business environment in Argentina has been, and may continue to
    be, affected by governmental and legal actions which impact our
    results of operations.

Europe

We operate in Europe in the following countries: the United
    Kingdom, Belgium, Poland and Ireland. The results of our
    operation in India are also included in this region. The
    operation in the United Kingdom represented 54% of the total
    premiums and fees in this region for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The United Kingdom operation underwrites
    risk in its home market and fourteen other countries across
    Europe offering credit insurance coverage.

Asia
    Pacific

We operate in the Asia Pacific region in the following
    countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and
    China. The activities in the region are primarily focused on
    individual business. The operations in South Korea and Taiwan
    represented 70% of the total premiums and fees in this region
    for the year ended December 31, 2008. The South Korean
    operation has significant sales of variable universal life and
    annuity products. The



Taiwanese operation has significant sales of annuity and
    endowment products. In 2007, we completed the sale of our
    Australia annuities and pension businesses to a third party. The
    Japanese joint venture operation offers fixed and guaranteed
    variable annuities and variable life products. We have a quota
    share reinsurance agreement with the joint venture in Japan,
    whereby we assume 100% of the living and death benefit guarantee
    riders associated with the variable annuity business written
    after April 2005 by the joint venture. The operating results of
    the joint venture operations in Japan and China are reflected in
    net investment income and are not consolidated in the financial
    results. Also, in 2007 we acquired the remaining 50% interest in
    a joint venture in Hong Kong resulting in the joint venture
    becoming a consolidated subsidiary.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home, operating through Metropolitan Property
    and Casualty Insurance Company and its subsidiaries
    (“MPC”), offers personal lines property and casualty
    insurance directly to employees at their employer’s
    worksite, as well as to individuals through a variety of retail
    distribution channels, including independent agents, property
    and casualty specialists, direct response marketing and the
    agency distribution group. Auto & Home primarily sells
    auto insurance, which represented 69% of Auto &
    Home’s total net earned premiums in 2008, and homeowners
    and other insurance, which represented 31% of Auto &
    Home’s total net earned premiums in 2008.

Products

Auto & Home’s insurance products include auto,
    homeowners, renters, condominium and dwelling, and other
    personal lines.

Auto Coverages.

Auto insurance policies
    include coverages for private passenger automobiles, utility
    automobiles and vans, motorcycles, motor homes, antique or
    classic automobiles and trailers. Auto & Home offers
    traditional coverages such as liability, uninsured motorist, no
    fault or personal injury protection and collision and
    comprehensive.

Homeowners and Other Coverages.

Homeowners
    insurance provides protection for homeowners, renters,
    condominium owners and residential landlords against losses
    arising out of damage to dwellings and contents from a wide
    variety of perils, as well as coverage for liability arising
    from ownership or occupancy. Other insurance includes personal
    excess liability (protection against losses in excess of amounts
    covered by other liability insurance policies), and coverages
    for recreational vehicles and boat owners.

Traditional insurance policies for dwellings represent the
    majority of Auto & Home’s homeowners’
    policies providing protection for loss on a “replacement
    cost” basis. These policies provide additional coverage for
    reasonable, normal living expenses incurred by policyholders
    that have been displaced from their homes.

Marketing
    and Distribution

Personal lines auto and homeowners insurance products are
    directly marketed to employees at their employer’s
    worksite. Auto & Home products are also marketed and
    sold to individuals by independent agents, property and casualty
    specialists, through a direct response channel and through the
    agency distribution group. Current economic conditions have
    impacted the ability to sell new policies. Declines in a variety
    of economic factors, most notably falling new and existing home
    sales as well as declines in auto sales, have reduced the number
    of potential shopping points strongly associated with new policy
    sales. Sales to employees at their employer’s worksite was
    the only distribution sector to record increased sales during
    2008 over those achieved in 2007.

Employer
    Worksite Programs

Auto & Home is a leading provider of auto and
    homeowners products offered to employees at their
    employer’s worksite. Net earned premiums increased by
    $27 million, or 2.6%, to $1.0 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. At
    December 31, 2008, 2,136 employers offered MetLife
    Auto & Home products to their employees.

Institutional marketing representatives market the
    Auto & Home program to employers through a variety of
    means, including broker referrals and cross-selling to MetLife
    group customers. Once permitted by the employer,



MetLife commences marketing efforts to employees. Employees who
    are interested in the auto and homeowners products can call a
    toll-free number to request a quote, to purchase coverage and to
    request payroll deduction over the telephone. Auto &
    Home has also developed proprietary software that permits an
    employee in most states to obtain a quote for auto insurance
    through Auto & Home’s Internet website.

Retail
    Distribution Channels

We market and sell Auto & Home products through
    independent agents, property and casualty specialists, a direct

    nine field claim offices, five in-house counsel offices,
    drive-in inspection sites and other sites throughout the United
    States. These employees included claim adjusters, appraisers,
    attorneys, managers, medical specialists, investigators,
    customer service representatives, claim financial analysts and
    support staff. Claim adjusters, representing the majority of
    employees, investigate, evaluate and settle over 700,000 claims
    annually.

Corporate &
    Other

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, which is invested to
    optimize investment spread and to fund company initiatives,
    various

start-up

entities, MetLife Bank which includes the 2008 acquisitions of a
    residential mortgage originating and servicing business and a
    reverse mortgage company, and run-off entities.
    Corporate & Other also includes interest expense
    related to the majority of our outstanding debt and expenses
    associated with certain legal proceedings. The elimination of
    all intersegment transactions from activity between segments
    occurs within Corporate & Other. In addition,
    Corporate & Other contains the restructuring costs of
    Operational Excellence, a corporate initiative further described
    below.

Operational
    Excellence Initiative

As a result of a strategic review which began in 2007, the
    Company has initiated an enterprise-wide cost reduction and
    revenue enhancement initiative referred to as “Operational
    Excellence.” This initiative is focused on reducing
    complexity, leveraging scale, increasing productivity, improving
    the effectiveness of the Company’s operations as well as
    providing a foundation for future growth.

Restructuring costs for Operational Excellence will encompass
    costs related to workforce reductions, lease consolidation, and
    asset impairments. Operational Excellence restructuring costs
    will occur in phases. In 2008, the



restructuring charge, primarily related to severance costs
    associated with workforce reductions, was $101 million.
    Additional restructuring charges including costs associated with
    severance and lease and asset impairments are expected to be
    incurred in 2009 and 2010. However, the 2009 and 2010 plans are
    not sufficiently developed to enable the Company to make an
    estimate of such restructuring charges at December 31,
    2008. In addition to the restructuring costs, there have been
    and will continue to be external consulting costs incurred
    throughout the execution of the initiative. The consultants
    support our project teams in terms of strategic direction and
    implementation. Costs incurred in connection with Operational
    Excellence are reflected in Corporate & Other as it is
    an enterprise-wide corporate initiative.

The scope and timing of this enterprise-wide initiative could be
    impacted by continued adverse economic conditions, capital
    market volatility and changes in strategic priorities.

Policyholder
    Liabilities

We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined
    amounts that are calculated to meet our policy obligations when
    a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured dies or becomes
    disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events, or to
    provide for future annuity payments. We compute the amounts for
    actuarial liabilities reported in our consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). For
    more details on Policyholder Liabilities see
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Critical Accounting Estimates — Liability for Future
    Policy Benefits” and Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Insurance Liabilities.”

Pursuant to state insurance laws, the Holding Company’s
    insurance subsidiaries establish statutory reserves, reported as
    liabilities, to meet their obligations on their respective
    policies. These statutory reserves are established in amounts
    sufficient to meet policy and contract obligations, when taken
    together with expected future premiums and interest at assumed
    rates. Statutory reserves generally differ from actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits determined using GAAP.

The New York Insurance Law and regulations require certain
    MetLife entities to submit to the New York Superintendent of
    Insurance (the “Superintendent”) or other state
    insurance departments, with each annual report, an opinion and
    memorandum of a “qualified actuary” that the statutory
    reserves and related actuarial amounts recorded in support of
    specified policies and contracts, and the assets supporting such
    statutory reserves and related actuarial amounts, make adequate
    provision for their statutory liabilities with respect to these
    obligations. See “— Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve
    Sufficiency Analysis.”

Underwriting
    and Pricing

Institutional,
    Individual and International Insurance Products

Our underwriting for the Institutional, Individual and
    International segments generally involves an evaluation of
    applications for life, non-medical health,
    retirement & savings, products and services by a
    professional staff of underwriters and actuaries, who determine
    the type and the amount of risk that we are willing to accept.
    In addition to the products described above, the International
    segment, also offers credit insurance and in a limited number of
    countries major medical products to both individual and
    institutional customers. We employ detailed underwriting
    policies, guidelines and procedures designed to assist the
    underwriter to properly assess and quantify risks before issuing
    policies to qualified applicants or groups.

Individual underwriting considers not only an applicant’s
    medical history, but also other factors such as financial
    profile, foreign travel, vocations and alcohol, drug and tobacco
    use. Group underwriting generally evaluates the risk
    characteristics of each prospective insured group, although with
    certain voluntary products, employees may be underwritten on an
    individual basis. We generally perform our own underwriting;
    however, certain policies are reviewed by intermediaries under
    guidelines established by us. Generally, we are not obligated to
    accept any risk or group of risks from, or to issue a policy or
    group of policies to, any employer or intermediary. Requests for
    coverage are reviewed on their merits and generally a policy is
    not issued unless the particular risk or group has been examined
    and approved by our underwriters.



Our remote underwriting offices, intermediaries as well as our
    corporate underwriting office are periodically reviewed via
    continuous ongoing internal underwriting audits to maintain
    high-standards of underwriting and consistency across the
    company. Such offices are also subject to periodic external
    audits by reinsurers with whom we do business.

We have established senior level oversight of the underwriting
    process that facilitates quality sales and serves the needs of
    our customers, while supporting our financial strength and
    business objectives. Our goal is to achieve the underwriting,
    mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions in
    our product pricing. This is accomplished by determining and
    establishing underwriting policies, guidelines, philosophies and
    strategies that are competitive and suitable for the customer,
    the agent and us.

Individual,
    Institutional and International Pricing

Pricing for the Institutional, Individual and International
    segments has traditionally reflected our corporate underwriting
    standards. Product pricing of insurance products is based on the
    expected payout of benefits calculated through the use of
    assumptions for mortality, morbidity, expenses, persistency and
    investment returns, as well as certain macroeconomic factors,
    such as inflation. Investment-oriented products are priced based
    on various factors, which may include investment return,
    expenses, persistency and optionality. For certain investment
    oriented products in the Institutional segment and for
    institutional business sold within the International segment,
    pricing may include prospective and retrospective experience
    rating features. Prospective experience rating involves the
    evaluation of past experience for the purpose of determining
    future premium rates and all prior year gains and losses are
    borne by the Company. Retrospective experience rating also
    involves the evaluation of past experience for the purpose of
    determining the actual cost of providing insurance for the
    customer, however, the contract includes certain features that
    allow the Company to recoup certain losses or distribute certain
    gains back to the policyholder based on actual prior years’
    experience.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. The current
    economic environment, with its volatility and uncertainty in
    interest rates, equity markets, asset valuations and
    unemployment trends has impacted or will most likely impact the
    pricing of our products.

•

For the Institutional segment and for the institutional business
    sold within the International segment, rates for group life and
    group non-medical and health products are based on anticipated
    results for the book of business being underwritten. Renewals
    are generally re-evaluated annually or biannually and are
    re-priced to reflect actual experience on such products.
    Retirement & savings type products are priced
    frequently and are very responsive to bond yields, and such
    prices include additional margin in periods of market
    uncertainty. This business is predominantly illiquid, because
    policyholders have no contractual rights to cash values and no
    options to change the form of the product’s benefits.

•

For the Individual segment and for individual business sold
    within the International segment, pricing of life insurance
    products is highly regulated and must be approved by the
    individual state regulators where the product is sold. Generally
    such products are renewed annually and may include pricing terms
    that are guaranteed for a certain period of time. Fixed and
    variable annuity products are also highly regulated and approved
    by the individual state regulators. Such products generally
    include penalties for early withdrawals and policyholder benefit
    elections to tailor the form of the product’s benefits to
    the needs of the opting policyholder. The Company periodically
    reevaluates the costs associated with such options and will
    periodically adjust pricing levels on its guarantees. Further,
    the Company from time to time may also reevaluate the type and
    level of guarantee features currently being offered.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home’s underwriting function has six
    principal aspects:

•

evaluating potential worksite marketing employer accounts and
    independent agencies;

•

establishing guidelines for the binding of risks;



•

reviewing coverage bound by agents;

•

underwriting potential insureds, on a case by case basis,
    presented by agents outside the scope of their binding authority;

•

pursuing information necessary in certain cases to enable
    Auto & Home to issue a policy within our
    guidelines; and

•

ensuring that renewal policies continue to be written at rates
    commensurate with risk.

Subject to very few exceptions, agents in each of
    Auto & Home’s distribution channels, as well as
    in our Institutional segment, have binding authority for risks
    which fall within Auto & Home’s published
    underwriting guidelines. Risks falling outside the underwriting
    guidelines may be submitted for approval to the underwriting
    department; alternatively, agents in such a situation may call
    the underwriting department to obtain authorization to bind the
    risk themselves. In most states, Auto & Home generally
    has the right within a specified period (usually the first
    60 days) to cancel any policy.

Auto & Home establishes prices for its major lines of
    insurance based on its proprietary database, rather than relying
    on rating bureaus. Auto & Home determines prices in
    part from a number of variables specific to each risk. The
    pricing of personal lines insurance products takes into account,
    among other things, the expected frequency and severity of
    losses, the costs of providing coverage (including the costs of
    acquiring policyholders and administering policy benefits and
    other administrative and overhead costs), competitive factors
    and profit considerations.

The major pricing variables for personal lines insurance include
    characteristics of the insured property, such as age, make and
    model or construction type, as well as characteristics of the
    insureds, such as driving record and loss experience, and the
    insured’s personal financial management. Auto &
    Home’s ability to set and change rates is subject to
    regulatory oversight.

As a condition of our license to do business in each state,
    Auto & Home, like all other automobile insurers, is
    required to write or share the cost of private passenger
    automobile insurance for higher risk individuals who would
    otherwise be unable to obtain such insurance. This
    “involuntary” market, also called the “shared
    market,” is governed by the applicable laws and regulations
    of each state, and policies written in this market are generally
    written at rates higher than standard rates.

We continually review our underwriting and pricing guidelines so
    that our policies remain competitive and supportive of our
    marketing strategies and profitability goals. The current
    economic environment, with its volatility and uncertainty is not
    expected to materially impact the pricing of our products.

Reinsurance
    Activity

We cede premiums to reinsurers under various agreements that
    cover individual risks, group risks or defined blocks of
    business, primarily on a coinsurance, yearly renewable term,
    excess or catastrophe excess basis. These reinsurance agreements
    spread the risk and minimize the effect of losses. The amount of
    each risk retained by us depends on our evaluation of the
    specific risk, subject, in certain circumstances, to maximum
    limits based on the characteristics of coverages. We also cede
    first dollar mortality risk under certain contracts. We obtain
    reinsurance when capital requirements and the economic terms of
    the reinsurance make it appropriate to do so. We reinsure our
    business through a diversified group of reinsurers.

Under the terms of the reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer
    agrees to reimburse us for the ceded amount in the event the
    claim is paid. However, we remain liable to our policyholders
    with respect to ceded reinsurance should any reinsurer be unable
    to meet its obligations under these agreements. Since we bear
    the risk of nonpayment by one or more of our reinsurers, we
    primarily cede reinsurance to well-capitalized, highly rated
    reinsurers. We evaluate the financial strength of our reinsurers
    by monitoring their ratings and analyzing their financial
    statements. We also analyze recent trends in arbitration and
    litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with our reinsurers.
    Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable balances are evaluated
    based on these analyses. We generally secure large reinsurance
    recoverable balances with various forms of collateral, including
    irrevocable letters of credit, secured trusts and funds withheld
    accounts.



Individual

Our life insurance operations participate in reinsurance
    activities in order to limit losses, minimize exposure to large
    risks, and provide additional capacity for future growth. We
    have historically reinsured the mortality risk on new individual
    life insurance policies primarily on an excess of retention
    basis or a quota share basis. Until 2005, we reinsured up to 90%
    of the mortality risk for all new individual life insurance
    policies that we wrote through our various franchises. This
    practice was initiated by the different franchises for different
    products starting at various points in time between 1992 and
    2000. During 2005, we changed our retention practices for
    certain individual life insurance policies. Amounts reinsured in
    prior years remain reinsured under the original reinsurance;
    however, under the new retention guidelines, we reinsure up to
    90% of the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most
    new individual life insurance policies that we write through our
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention limits remained unchanged. On a case by case basis, we
    may retain up to $20 million per life and reinsure 100% of
    amounts in excess of our retention limits. We evaluate our
    reinsurance programs routinely and may increase or decrease our
    retention at any time. In addition, we reinsure a significant
    portion of the mortality risk on our individual universal life
    policies issued since 1983. Placement of reinsurance is done
    primarily on an automatic basis and also on a facultative basis
    for risks with specific characteristics.

We also reinsure a portion of the living and death benefit
    riders issued in connection with our variable annuities. Under
    these reinsurance agreements, we pay a reinsurance premium
    generally based on rider fees collected from policyholders and
    receive reimbursements for benefits paid or accrued in excess of
    account values, subject to certain limitations. We enter into
    similar agreements for new or in-force business depending on
    market conditions.

In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described above, we
    reinsure other risks, as well as specific coverages. We
    routinely reinsure certain classes of risks in order to limit
    our exposure to particular travel, avocation and lifestyle
    hazards. We have exposure to catastrophes, which could
    contribute to significant fluctuations in our results of
    operations. We use excess of retention and quota share
    reinsurance arrangements to provide greater diversification of
    risk and minimize exposure to larger risks.

Institutional

The Institutional segment generally retains most of its risks
    and does not significantly utilize reinsurance. We may, on
    certain client arrangements, cede particular risks to reinsurers.

Auto &
    Home

Auto & Home purchases reinsurance to control our
    exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe losses) and to
    protect statutory surplus. Auto & Home cedes to
    reinsurers a portion of losses and cedes premiums based upon the
    risk and exposure of the policies subject to reinsurance.

To control our exposure to large property and casualty losses,
    Auto & Home utilizes property catastrophe, casualty,
    and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

Corporate &
    Other

We also reinsure through 100% quota-share reinsurance agreements
    certain long-term care and workers’ compensation business
    written by MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut
    (“MICC”), a subsidiary of the Company, prior to our
    acquisition of MICC. These run-off businesses have been included
    within Corporate & Other since the acquisition of MICC.

    reinsurance recoverable balances, $5,194 million were
    secured by funds held in trust as collateral and
    $209 million were secured through irrevocable letters of
    credit issued by various financial institutions. We evaluate the
    collectibility of reinsurance recoverable balances as described
    previously and at December 31, 2008 allowances for
    uncollectible balances were not material.

Regulation

Insurance
    Regulation

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is licensed to transact
    insurance business in, and is subject to regulation and
    supervision by, all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
    Guam, Puerto Rico, Canada, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
    Northern Mariana Islands. Each of MetLife’s insurance
    subsidiaries is licensed and regulated in each U.S. and
    international jurisdiction where they conduct insurance
    business. The extent of such regulation varies, but most
    jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial
    aspects of insurers, including standards of solvency, statutory
    reserves, reinsurance and capital adequacy, and the business
    conduct of insurers. In addition, statutes and regulations
    usually require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the
    approval of policy forms and certain other related materials
    and, for certain lines of insurance, the approval of rates. Such
    statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and
    concentration of investments. The New York Insurance Law limits
    both the amounts of agent compensation throughout the United
    States, as well as the sales commissions and certain other
    marketing expenses that may be incurred in connection with the
    sale of life insurance policies and annuity contracts.

Each insurance subsidiary is required to file reports, generally
    including detailed annual financial statements, with insurance
    regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which it
    does business, and its operations and accounts are subject to
    periodic examination by such authorities. These subsidiaries
    must also file, and in many jurisdictions and in some lines of
    insurance obtain regulatory approval for, rules, rates and forms
    relating to the insurance written in the jurisdictions in which
    they operate.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) has established a program of accrediting
    state insurance departments. NAIC accreditation contemplates
    that accredited states will conduct periodic examinations of
    insurers domiciled in such states. NAIC-accredited states will
    not accept reports of examination of insurers from unaccredited
    states, except under limited circumstances. As a direct result,
    insurers domiciled in unaccredited states may be subject to
    financial examination by accredited states in which they are
    licensed, in addition to any examinations conducted by their
    domiciliary states. The New York State Department of Insurance
    (the “Department”), MLIC’s principal insurance
    regulator, has not received accreditation. Historically, the
    lack of accreditation has resulted from the New York
    legislature’s failure to adopt certain model NAIC laws,
    although legislation enacted by the New York legislature in
    2007 may have removed any statutory barriers to the
    Department pursuing accreditation. While the Department may seek
    to become accredited in the future, it is not certain whether
    other impediments to accreditation remain. We do not believe
    that the absence of this accreditation will have a significant
    impact upon our ability to conduct our insurance businesses.



State and federal insurance and securities regulatory
    authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and
    attorneys general from time to time make inquiries regarding
    compliance by the Holding Company and its insurance subsidiaries
    with insurance, securities and other laws and regulations
    regarding the conduct of our insurance and securities
    businesses. We cooperate with such inquiries and take corrective
    action when warranted. See “Legal Proceedings.”

Holding Company Regulation.

The Holding
    Company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation
    under the insurance holding company laws of various
    jurisdictions. The insurance holding company laws and
    regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but
    generally require a controlled insurance company (insurers that
    are subsidiaries of insurance holding companies) to register
    with state regulatory authorities and to file with those
    authorities certain reports, including information concerning
    its capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain
    intercompany transactions and general business operations.

State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent
    companies, as well as on transactions between an insurer and its
    affiliates. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Dividends.” The New York Insurance Law and the regulations
    thereunder also restrict the aggregate amount of investments
    MLIC may make in non-life insurance subsidiaries, and provide
    for detailed periodic reporting on subsidiaries.

Guaranty Associations and Similar
    Arrangements.

Most of the jurisdictions in which
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are admitted to
    transact business require life and property and casualty
    insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate
    in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay certain
    contractual insurance benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer is engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets.

In the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against
    MetLife have not been material. We have established liabilities
    for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate for
    assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject
    to insolvency proceedings. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Insolvency Assessments.”

Statutory Insurance Examination.

As part of
    their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments
    conduct periodic detailed examinations of the books, records,
    accounts, and business practices of insurers domiciled in their
    states. State insurance departments also have the authority to
    conduct examinations of non-domiciliary insurers that are
    licensed in their states. During the three-year period ended
    December 31, 2008, MetLife has not received any material
    adverse findings resulting from state insurance department
    examinations of its insurance subsidiaries conducted during this
    three-year period.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to MLIC’s, New England
    Life Insurance Company’s (“NELICO”) or General
    American Life Insurance Company’s (“GALIC”) sales
    of individual life insurance policies or annuities. Over the
    past several years, these and a number of investigations by
    other regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments
    and certain other relief. We may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner.

Policy and Contract Reserve Sufficiency
    Analysis.

Annually, MetLife’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to conduct an
    analysis of the sufficiency of all statutory reserves. In each
    case, a qualified actuary must submit an opinion which states
    that the statutory reserves, when considered in light of the
    assets held with respect to such reserves, make good and
    sufficient provision for the associated contractual obligations
    and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot
    be provided, the insurer must set up additional reserves by
    moving funds from surplus. Since inception of this requirement,
    the Company’s insurance subsidiaries which are required by
    their states of domicile to provide these opinions have provided
    such opinions without qualifications.



Surplus and Capital.

The Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to the supervision
    of the regulators in each jurisdiction in which they are
    licensed to transact business. Regulators have discretionary
    authority, in connection with the continued licensing of these
    insurance subsidiaries, to limit or prohibit sales to
    policyholders if, in their judgment, the regulators determine
    that such insurer has not maintained the minimum surplus or
    capital or that the further transaction of business will be
    hazardous to policyholders. See “— Risk-Based
    Capital.”

Risk-Based Capital
    (“

RBC

”).

Each of the
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries is subject to
    certain RBC requirements and reports its RBC based on a formula
    calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium and
    statutory reserve items. The formula takes into account the risk
    characteristics of the insurer, including asset risk, insurance
    risk, interest rate risk and business risk. The formula is used
    as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible
    inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating
    regulatory action, and not as a means to rank insurers
    generally. State insurance laws provide insurance regulators the
    authority to require various actions by, or take various actions
    against, insurers whose RBC ratio does not exceed certain RBC
    levels. As of the date of the most recent annual statutory
    financial statements filed with insurance regulators, the RBC of
    each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC
    levels. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — The
    Company — Capital.”

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”) in 2001. Codification was
    intended to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to
    state insurance departments. However, statutory accounting
    principles continue to be established by individual state laws
    and permitted practices. The Department has adopted Codification
    with certain modifications for the preparation of statutory
    financial statements of insurance companies domiciled in New
    York. Modifications by the various state insurance departments
    may impact the effect of Codification on the statutory capital
    and surplus of the Company’s insurance subsidiaries.

Regulation of Investments.

Each of the
    Company’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    state laws and regulations that require diversification of its
    investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in
    certain asset categories, such as below investment grade fixed
    income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments,
    and derivatives. Failure to comply with these laws and
    regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory
    limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of
    measuring surplus, and, in some instances, would require
    divestiture of such non-qualifying investments. We believe that
    the investments made by each of the Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries complied, in all material respects, with such
    regulations at December 31, 2008.

Federal Initiatives.

Although the federal
    government generally does not directly regulate the insurance
    business, federal initiatives often have an impact on our
    business in a variety of ways. From time to time, federal
    measures are proposed which may significantly affect the
    insurance business; the potential for this resides primarily in
    the tax-writing committees. At the present time, we do not know
    of any federal legislative initiatives that, if enacted, would
    adversely impact our business, results of operations or
    financial condition. These federal measures may have an adverse
    impact on our business, results of operations or financial
    condition. See “Risk Factors — There Can be No
    Assurance that actions of the U.S. Government, Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory
    Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing the Financial Markets Will
    Achieve the Intended Effect.”

Legislative Developments.

On August 17,
    2006, President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. This act is considered to be the
    most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”) on September 2, 1974. The provisions of
    the PPA, some of which were effective immediately and some which
    become effective through 2012, may, over time, have a
    significant impact on demand for pension, retirement savings,
    and lifestyle protection products in both the institutional and
    retail markets. The impact of the legislation may have a
    positive effect on the life insurance and financial services
    industries in the future. In the short-term, regulations on a
    number of key provisions have either been issued in proposed or
    final form. The final default investment regulations were issued
    in October 2007. Final regulations were proposed on investment
    advice in October 2008 and final regulations on the selection of
    annuity providers for defined contribution plans were issued in
    October 2008, becoming effective in December 2008. As these
    regulations are likely to interact with one another as plan
    sponsors evaluate them, we cannot predict whether



these regulations will be adopted as proposed, or what impact,
    if any, such proposals may have on our business, results of
    operations or financial condition.

On December 23, 2008, President Bush signed into law the
    Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act which, among other
    things, eases the transition to the new funding requirements
    contained in the PPA for defined benefit plans.

On February 8, 2006, President Bush signed into law the
    Deficit Reduction Act which, among other things, created the
    ability for states to implement an LTC partnership program.
    States are currently implementing the partnership program. While
    implementation has generated an increased level of awareness
    regarding the need to fund long-term care, it is still too early
    to quantify what effect, if any, this legislation will have on
    our LTC business.

We cannot predict what other proposals may be made, what
    legislation may be introduced or enacted or the impact of any
    such legislation on our business, results of operations and
    financial condition.

Governmental
    Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions

U.S. Federal Governmental
    Responses.

Throughout 2008 and continuing in
    2009, Congress, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the
    U.S. Treasury and other agencies of the Federal government
    took a number of increasingly aggressive actions (in addition to
    continuing a series of interest rate reductions that began in
    the second half of 2007) intended to provide liquidity to
    financial institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor
    confidence in particular troubled institutions and to prevent or
    contain the spread of the financial crisis. These measures have
    included:

•

expanding the types of institutions that have access to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s discount window;

•

providing asset guarantees and emergency loans to particular
    distressed companies;

•

a temporary ban on short selling of shares of certain financial
    institutions (including, for a period, MetLife);

•

programs intended to reduce the volume of mortgage foreclosures
    by modifying the terms of mortgage loans for distressed
    borrowers;

•

temporarily guaranteeing money market funds; and

•

programs to support the mortgage-backed securities market and
    mortgage lending.

In addition to these actions, pursuant to the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”), enacted in October
    2008, the U.S. Treasury has been injecting capital into
    selected banking institutions and their holding companies. At
    December 31, 2008, $250 billion of the total
    $700 billion available under EESA had been dedicated to
    making such capital infusions. EESA also authorizes the
    U.S. Treasury to purchase up mortgage-backed and other
    securities from financial institutions as part of the overall
    $700 billion available for the purpose of stabilizing the
    financial markets, although at December 31, 2008, the
    U.S. Treasury had indicated a general intention not to
    acquire mortgage-backed and similar securities. The Federal
    government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other
    governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering
    taking other actions to address the financial crisis. For
    example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been making
    funds available to commercial and financial companies under a
    number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding
    Facility (the “CPFF”), and the FDIC has established
    the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “FDIC
    Program”), as discussed further below.

In February 2009, the Treasury Department outlined a financial
    stability plan with additional measures to provide capital
    relief to institutions holding troubled assets, including a
    capital assistance program for banks that have undergone a
    “stress test” (the “Capital Assistance
    Program”) and a public-private investment fund to purchase
    troubled assets from financial institutions. The administration
    has also announced its Homeowner Affordability and Stability
    Plan, which includes a number of elements intended to reduce the
    number of mortgage foreclosures. Further details of this plan
    are expected to be announced in March. The U.S. government
    may also establish additional programs to improve liquidity in
    the financial markets, support asset prices and recapitalize the
    financial sector. There can be no assurance as to the form of
    any such additional programs or the impact that these additional



measures or any existing governmental programs will have on the
    financial markets, whether on the levels of volatility currently
    being experienced, the levels of lending by financial
    institutions, the prices buyers are willing to pay for financial
    assets or otherwise. The choices made by the U.S. Treasury
    in its distribution of amounts available under the EESA, the
    Capital Assistance Program and other programs could have the
    effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services
    industry more than others or providing advantages to some of our
    competitors. See “Risk Factors — Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability.”

In addition to the various measures to foster liquidity and
    recapitalize the banking sector, the Federal government also
    passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February
    2009 that provides for nearly $790 billion in additional
    federal spending, tax cuts and federal aid intended to spur
    economic activity.

MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible
    to sell assets to the U.S. Treasury under one or more of
    the programs established under EESA, and some of their assets
    may be among those the U.S. Treasury or the public-private
    investment partnership proposed by the U.S. Treasury offers
    to purchase, either directly or through auction. Furthermore, as
    a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. was eligible to apply for
    and could be selected to participate in the capital infusion
    program established under EESA, pursuant to which the
    U.S. Treasury purchases preferred shares of banking
    institutions or their holding companies and acquires warrants
    for their common shares. If we choose to participate in this
    capital infusion program, we will become subject to requirements
    and restrictions on our business. Issuing preferred shares and
    warrants could dilute the ownership interests of stockholders or
    affect our ability to raise capital in other transactions. We
    could also become subject to restrictions on the compensation
    that we can offer or pay to certain executive employees,
    including incentives or performance-based compensation. These
    restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and
    retaining management with the talent and experience to manage
    our business effectively. Limits on our ability to deduct
    certain compensation paid to executive employees will also be
    imposed. The U.S. Treasury may also impose additional
    restrictions in the future, and such restrictions may apply to
    institutions receiving government assistance or financial
    institutions generally. In January 2009, Congress released the
    remaining $350 billion (of the $700 billion)
    authorized by the EESA. The stimulus legislation enacted in
    February 2009 contains additional restrictions on executive
    compensation for companies that have received or will receive
    Federal financial assistance under EESA, and Congress could
    impose additional requirements and conditions could be imposed
    on firms receiving Federal assistance.

Two of our commercial paper programs have been accepted for the
    CPFF. The CPFF is intended to improve liquidity in short-term
    funding markets by increasing the availability of term
    commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing greater
    assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will be able
    to rollover their maturing commercial paper. MetLife Short Term
    Funding LLC, an issuer of commercial paper under a program
    supported by funding agreements issued by Metropolitan Life
    Insurance Company and MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut,
    was accepted in October 2008 for the CPFF and may issue a
    maximum amount of $3.8 billion under the CPFF. At
    December 31, 2008, MetLife Short Term Funding LLC had used
    $1,650 million of its available capacity under the CPFF,
    and such amount was deposited under the related funding
    agreements. MetLife Funding, Inc. was accepted in November 2008
    for the CPFF and may issue a maximum amount of $1 billion
    under the CPFF. No drawdown by MetLife Funding, Inc. has taken
    place under this facility as of the date hereof.

MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank may issue debt guaranteed by the
    FDIC under the FDIC Program. Under the terms of the FDIC
    Program, the FDIC will guarantee through June 2012 (or maturity,
    if earlier) the payment of certain newly-issued senior unsecured
    debt of MetLife, Inc. or MetLife Bank (or any other eligible
    affiliate approved to participate by the FDIC) issued prior to
    October 31, 2009. We have elected the option of excluding
    specified senior unsecured debt maturing after June 30,
    2012, from the guarantee before reaching the limits on the
    amount of guaranteed debt under the FDIC Program
    ($398 million for MetLife, Inc. and $178 million for
    MetLife Bank, which may issue debt under its limit, as well as
    any unused amounts under MetLife, Inc.’s limit). In
    addition, MetLife Bank has opted out of the component of the
    FDIC Program that guarantees non-interest bearing deposit
    transaction accounts. As of the date hereof, neither MetLife,
    Inc. nor MetLife Bank has issued debt guaranteed under the FDIC
    Program. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Liquidity and Capital Resources — Extraordinary Market
    Conditions.”



MetLife Bank has the capacity to borrow from the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York’s Discount Window and from the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York under the Term Auction Facility. As of
    December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank had borrowed
    $950 million under the Term Auction Facility.

State Insurance Regulatory Responses.

In
    January 2009, the NAIC considered, but declined, a number of
    reserve and capital relief requests made by the American Council
    of Life Insurers, acting on behalf of its member companies.
    These requests, if adopted, would have generally resulted in
    lower statutory reserve and capital requirements, effective
    December 31, 2008, for life insurance companies. However,
    notwithstanding the NAIC’s action on these requests,
    insurance companies have the right to approach the insurance
    regulator in their respective state of domicile and request
    relief. Several MetLife insurance entities requested and were
    granted relief, with a beneficial impact on capital as of
    December 31, 2008. We understand that various competitors
    have also requested and were sometimes granted relief, but we
    cannot quantify or project the impact on the competitive
    landscape of such relief or any subsequent regulatory relief
    that may be granted.

Foreign Governmental Responses.

In an effort
    to strengthen the financial condition of key financial
    institutions or avert their collapse, and to forestall or reduce
    the effects of reduced lending activity, a number of foreign
    governments have also taken actions similar to some of those
    taken by the U.S. Federal government, including injecting
    capital into domestic financial institutions in exchange for
    ownership stakes. We cannot predict whether these actions will
    achieve their intended purpose or how they will impact
    competition in the financial services industry.

Broker-Dealer
    and Securities Regulation

Some of the Company’s subsidiaries and their activities in
    offering and selling variable insurance products are subject to
    extensive regulation under the federal securities laws
    administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”). These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
    (the “Investment Company Act”). Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of
    which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a
    registered investment company under the Investment Company Act.
    In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life
    insurance policies issued by the separate accounts are
    registered with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as
    amended (the “Securities Act”). Other subsidiaries are
    registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
    and are members of, and subject to, regulation by the Financial
    Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Further, some
    of the Company’s subsidiaries are registered as investment
    advisers with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
    as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”), and are
    also registered as investment advisers in various states, as
    applicable. Certain variable contract separate accounts
    sponsored by the Company’s subsidiaries are exempt from
    registration, but may be subject to other provisions of the
    federal securities laws.

Federal and state securities regulatory authorities and FINRA
    from time to time make inquiries and conduct examinations
    regarding compliance by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries
    with securities and other laws and regulations. We cooperate
    with such inquiries and examinations and take corrective action
    when warranted.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to protect investors in the securities markets and
    generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking and
    enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict the
    conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and
    regulations. We may also be subject to similar laws and
    regulations in the foreign countries in which we provide
    investment advisory services, offer products similar to those
    described above, or conduct other activities.

Environmental
    Considerations

As an owner and operator of real property, we are subject to
    extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and
    regulations. Inherent in such ownership and operation is also
    the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities
    and costs in connection with any required remediation of such
    properties. In addition, we hold equity interests in companies
    that could potentially be subject to environmental liabilities.
    We routinely have environmental assessments performed with
    respect to real estate being acquired for investment and real
    property to



be acquired through foreclosure. We cannot provide assurance
    that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise.
    However, based on information currently available to management,
    management believes that any costs associated with compliance
    with environmental laws and regulations or any remediation of
    such properties will not have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations or financial condition.

ERISA
    Considerations

We provide products and services to certain employee benefit
    plans that are subject to ERISA, or the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, our activities
    are subject to the restrictions imposed by ERISA and the Code,
    including the requirement under ERISA that fiduciaries must
    perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan
    participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under ERISA
    and the Code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to
    engage in prohibited transactions with persons who have certain
    relationships with respect to such plans. The applicable
    provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to enforcement by
    the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service and the
    Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”).

In

John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company v. Harris
    Trust and Savings Bank (1993)

, the U.S. Supreme Court
    held that certain assets in excess of amounts necessary to
    satisfy guaranteed obligations under a participating group
    annuity general account contract are “plan assets.”
    Therefore, these assets are subject to certain fiduciary
    obligations under ERISA, which requires fiduciaries to perform
    their duties solely in the interest of ERISA plan participants
    and beneficiaries. On January 5, 2000, the Secretary of
    Labor issued final regulations indicating, in cases where an
    insurer has issued a policy backed by the insurer’s general
    account to or for an employee benefit plan, the extent to which
    assets of the insurer constitute plan assets for purposes of
    ERISA and the Code. The regulations apply only with respect to a
    policy issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998
    (“Transition Policy”). No person will generally be
    liable under ERISA or the Code for conduct occurring prior to
    July 5, 2001, where the basis of a claim is that insurance
    company general account assets constitute plan assets. An
    insurer issuing a new policy that is backed by its general
    account and is issued to or for an employee benefit plan after
    December 31, 1998 will generally be subject to fiduciary
    obligations under ERISA, unless the policy is a guaranteed
    benefit policy.

The regulations indicate the requirements that must be met so
    that assets supporting a Transition Policy will not be
    considered plan assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code. These
    requirements include detailed disclosures to be made to the
    employee benefits plan and the requirement that the insurer must
    permit the policyholder to terminate the policy on 90 day
    notice and receive without penalty, at the policyholder’s
    option, either (i) the unallocated accumulated fund balance
    (which may be subject to market value adjustment) or (ii) a
    book value payment of such amount in annual installments with
    interest. We have taken and continue to take steps designed to
    ensure compliance with these regulations.

Financial
    Holding Company Regulation

Regulatory Agencies.

In connection with its
    acquisition of a federally-chartered commercial bank, MetLife,
    Inc. became a bank holding company and financial holding company
    on February 28, 2001. As such, the Holding Company is
    subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and to inspection,
    examination, and supervision by the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York System (the “FRB”).
    In addition, the Holding Company’s banking subsidiary is
    subject to regulation and examination primarily by the Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and
    secondarily by the FRB and the FDIC. The Office of Thrift
    Supervision has granted our request to suspend processing of our
    pending applications to convert MetLife Bank, N.A. from a
    national association to a federal savings bank and to convert
    MetLife, Inc. from a financial holding company to a savings and
    loan holding company.

Financial Holding Company Activities.

As a
    financial holding company, MetLife, Inc.’s activities and
    investments are restricted by the BHC Act, as amended by the
    Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”), to
    those that are “financial” in nature or
    “incidental” or “complementary” to such
    financial activities. Activities that are financial in nature
    include securities underwriting, dealing and market making,
    sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies, insurance
    underwriting and agency, merchant banking and activities that
    the FRB has



determined to be closely related to banking. In addition, under
    the insurance company investment portfolio provision of the GLB
    Act, financial holding companies are authorized to make
    investments in other financial and non-financial companies,
    through their insurance subsidiaries, that are in the ordinary
    course of business and in accordance with state insurance law,
    provided the financial holding company does not routinely manage
    or operate such companies except as may be necessary to obtain a
    reasonable return on investment.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies —
    Capital.

MetLife, Inc. and its insured depository
    institution subsidiary, MetLife Bank, are subject to risk-based
    and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking
    regulatory agencies for banks and financial holding companies.
    The federal banking regulatory agencies are required by law to
    take specific prompt corrective actions with respect to
    institutions that do not meet minimum capital standards. At
    December 31, 2008, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank were in
    compliance with the aforementioned guidelines.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Consumer Protection
    Laws.

Numerous other federal and state laws also
    affect the Holding Company’s and MetLife Bank’s
    earnings and activities, including federal and state consumer
    protection laws. The GLB Act included consumer privacy
    provisions that, among other things, require disclosure of a
    financial institution’s privacy policy to customers. In
    addition, these provisions permit states to adopt more extensive
    privacy protections through legislation or regulation.

Other Restrictions and Limitations on Bank Holding Companies
    and Financial Holding Companies — Change of
    Control.

Because MetLife, Inc. is a financial
    holding company and bank holding company under the federal
    banking laws, no person may acquire control of MetLife, Inc.
    without the prior approval of the FRB. A change of control is
    conclusively presumed upon acquisitions of 25% or more of any
    class of voting securities and rebuttably presumed upon
    acquisitions of 10% or more of any class of voting securities.
    Further, as a result of MetLife, Inc.’s ownership of
    MetLife Bank, approval from the OCC would be required in
    connection with a change of control (generally presumed upon the
    acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting securities) of
    MetLife, Inc.

Competition

Our management believes that competition faced by our business
    segments is based on a number of factors, including service,
    product features, scale, price, financial strength,
    claims-paying ratings, credit ratings, ebusiness capabilities
    and name recognition. We compete with a large number of other
    insurance companies, as well as non-insurance financial services
    companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, for
    individual consumers, employer and other group customers as well
    as agents and other distributors of insurance and investment
    products. Some of these companies offer a broader array of
    products, have more competitive pricing or, with respect to
    other insurance companies, have higher claims paying ability
    ratings. Many of our insurance products, particularly those
    offered by our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually
    and, accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be
    able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us.

We believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began
    in the latter half of 2008, its impact on the capital position
    of many competitors, and subsequent actions by regulators and
    rating agencies have altered the competitive environment. In
    particular, we believe that these factors have highlighted
    financial strength as the most significant differentiator from
    the perspective of customers and certain distributors. We
    believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this
    environment. In particular, the Company distributes many of its
    individual products through other financial institutions such as
    banks and broker dealers. These distribution partners are
    currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of
    the company whose products they sell. In addition, the financial
    market turbulence has highlighted the extent of the risk
    associated with certain variable annuity products and has led
    many companies in our industry to re-examine the pricing and
    features of the products they offer. The effects of current
    market conditions may also lead to consolidation in the life
    insurance industry. Although we cannot predict the ultimate
    impact of these conditions, we believe that the strongest
    companies will enjoy a competitive advantage as a result of the
    current circumstances.



We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurance companies for sales
    representatives with demonstrated ability. We compete with other
    insurance companies for sales representatives primarily on the
    basis of our financial position, support services and
    compensation and product features. See
    “— Individual — Marketing and
    Distribution.” We continue to undertake several initiatives
    to grow our career agency force, while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial position could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents.

Numerous aspects of our business are subject to regulation.
    Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory
    environment can affect our competitive position within the life
    insurance industry and within the broader financial services
    industry. See “— Regulation” and “Risk
    Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State
    Securities Laws May Affect Our Operations and Our
    Profitability.”

Company
    Ratings

Insurer financial strength ratings represent the opinions of
    rating agencies, including A.M. Best Company
    (“A.M. Best”), Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”),
    Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and
    Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services
    (“S&P”), regarding the ability of an insurance
    company to meet its financial obligations to policyholders and
    contract holders. Credit ratings represent the opinions of
    rating agencies regarding an issuer’s ability to repay its
    indebtedness.

Rating
    Stability Indicators

Rating agencies use an “outlook statement” of
    “positive,” “stable,” “negative”
    or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term
    trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a
    rating change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to
    indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a
    “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency from
    changing a rating at any time, without notice. See “Risk
    Factors — A Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our
    Financial Strength or Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of
    Business and Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations.”

Rating
    Actions

In September and October 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch,
    Moody’s, and S&P each revised its outlook for the
    U.S. life insurance sector to negative from stable. In
    January 2009, S&P reiterated its negative outlook on the
    U.S. life insurance sector. Management believes that the
    rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they
    apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope
    of their credit reviews, may request additional information from
    the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital
    and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for
    maintenance of certain ratings levels.

In November 2008, A.M. Best downgraded the insurer
    financial strength rating for Texas Life Insurance Company from
    A to A−.

At December 31, 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s
    and S&P each had MetLife and its Subsidiaries’ insurer
    financial strength and credit ratings on “stable”
    outlook; however, (i) on February 9, 2009,

The foregoing insurer financial strength ratings reflect each
    rating agency’s opinion of MLIC and the Holding
    Company’s other insurance subsidiaries’ financial
    characteristics with respect to their ability to pay obligations
    under insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their
    terms, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of
    investors in the Holding Company’s securities. Credit
    ratings are opinions of each agency with respect to specific
    securities and contractual financial obligations and the
    issuer’s ability and willingness to meet those obligations
    when due. Neither insurer financial strength nor credit ratings
    are statements of fact nor are they recommendations to purchase,
    hold or sell any security, contract or policy. Each rating
    should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

A ratings downgrade (or the potential for such a downgrade) of
    MLIC or any of the Holding Company’s other insurance
    subsidiaries could potentially, among other things, increase the
    number of policies surrendered and withdrawals by policyholders
    of cash values from their policies, adversely affect
    relationships with broker-dealers, banks, agents, wholesalers
    and other distributors of our products and services, negatively
    impact new sales, and adversely affect our ability to compete
    and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business,
    results of operations and financial condition. See also
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Extraordinary Market
    Conditions” for a more complete description of the impact
    of a ratings downgrade.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Adverse
    Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect
    Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Access to Capital and Cost
    of Capital

The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme
    volatility and disruption. At times, the volatility and
    disruption have reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the
    markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of
    liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers.

We need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our
    debt and dividends on our capital stock, maintain our securities
    lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities.
    Without sufficient liquidity, we will be forced to curtail our
    operations, and our business will suffer. The principal sources
    of our liquidity are insurance premiums, annuity considerations,
    deposit funds, cash flow from our investment portfolio and
    assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily
    convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets
    also include short-term instruments such as repurchase
    agreements and commercial paper. Sources of capital in normal
    markets include long-term instruments, medium- and long-term
    debt, junior subordinated debt securities, capital securities
    and equity securities.

In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may
    have to seek additional financing. The availability of
    additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as
    market conditions, the general availability of credit, the
    volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit
    to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and
    credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or
    lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or
    short-term financial prospects if we incur large investment
    losses or if the level of our business activity decreased due to
    a market downturn. Similarly, our access to funds may be
    impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take
    negative actions against us. Our internal sources of liquidity
    may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be
    able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable
    terms, or at all.

Our liquidity requirements may change. For instance, we have
    funding agreements which can be put to us after a period of
    notice. The notice requirements vary; however, the shortest
    period is 90 days, applicable to approximately
    $1 billion of such liabilities at December 31, 2008.

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit
    markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate
    our business, most significantly our insurance operations. Such
    market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely
    manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital
    requirements; and access the capital necessary to grow our
    business. As such, we may be forced to delay raising capital,
    issue different types of capital than we would otherwise, less
    effectively deploy such capital, issue shorter tenor securities
    than we prefer, or bear an unattractive cost of capital which
    could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our
    financial flexibility. Recently our credit spreads have widened
    considerably. Our results of operations, financial condition,



cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially
    adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets.

Difficult
    Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy
    Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and
    Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in
    the Near Future

Our results of operations are materially affected by conditions
    in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world. The stress
    experienced by global capital markets that began in the second
    half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during 2008.
    Concerns over the availability and cost of credit, the
    U.S. mortgage market, geopolitical issues, energy costs,
    inflation and a declining real estate market in the United
    States contributed to increased volatility and diminished
    expectations for the economy and the markets in the near term.
    These factors, combined with declining business and consumer
    confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated a
    recession. In addition, the fixed-income markets have
    experienced a period of extreme volatility which negatively
    impacted market liquidity conditions. Initially, the concerns on
    the part of market participants were focused on the sub-prime
    segment of the mortgage-backed securities market. However, these
    concerns expanded to include a broad range of mortgage- and
    asset-backed and other fixed income securities, including those
    rated investment grade, the U.S. and international credit
    and interbank money markets generally, and a wide range of
    financial institutions and markets, asset classes and sectors.
    Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and
    have less opportunity for disposal. Domestic and international
    equity markets have also experienced heightened volatility and
    turmoil, with issuers (such as our company) that have exposure
    to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets particularly
    affected. These events and continued market upheavals may have
    an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large
    investment portfolio and are also dependent upon customer
    behavior. Our revenues are likely to decline in such
    circumstances and our profit margins could erode. In addition,
    in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the
    global credit crisis, we could incur significant losses. Even in
    the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial
    risk of loss due to market volatility. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Extraordinary Market
    Conditions.”

We are a significant writer of variable annuity products. The
    account values of these products will be affected by the
    downturn in capital markets. Any decrease in account values will
    decrease the fees generated by our variable annuity products,
    cause the amortization of deferred acquisition costs to
    accelerate and may increase the level of reserves we must carry
    to support those variable annuities issued with any associated
    guarantees.

Factors such as consumer spending, business investment,
    government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital
    markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic
    environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our
    business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher
    unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings,
    lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the
    demand for our financial and insurance products could be
    adversely affected. In addition, we may experience an elevated
    incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our
    policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or
    stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse changes in
    the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a
    material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition. The current crisis has also raised the
    possibility of future legislative and regulatory actions in
    addition to the recent enactment of the Emergency Economic
    Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) that could
    further impact our business. We cannot predict whether or when
    such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions
    could have on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition. See “— There Can be No Assurance that
    Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the
    Purpose of Stabilizing the Financial Markets Will Achieve the
    Intended Effect” and “— Competitive Factors
    May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability.”

There
    Can be No Assurance that Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory
    Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing the Financial Markets Will
    Achieve the Intended Effect

In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system
    and financial markets and going concern threats to investment
    banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008,
    President Bush signed the EESA into law.



Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority
    to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of
    mortgage-backed and other securities from financial institutions
    for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. At
    December 31, 2008, $250 billion of this amount had
    been dedicated to making capital infusions to banking
    institutions and their holding companies. The Federal
    Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal
    Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other
    governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering
    taking other actions to address the financial crisis. For
    example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been making
    funds available to commercial and financial companies under a
    number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding
    Facility and the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
    Program (the “FDIC Program”), as discussed further
    below, and legislation is pending in Congress that will allow
    bankruptcy judges in certain bankruptcy proceedings to alter the
    terms of certain mortgages, including reducing the principal
    amount of the loan. There can be no assurance as to what impact
    such actions will have on the financial markets, whether on the
    levels of volatility currently being experienced, the levels of
    lending by financial institutions, the prices buyers are willing
    to pay for financial assets or otherwise. Continued volatility,
    low levels of credit availability and low prices for financial
    assets materially and adversely affect our business, financial
    condition and results of operations and the trading price of our
    common stock. Furthermore, if the mortgage-related legislation
    is passed, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our
    nonagency prime residential mortgage backed security holdings
    and could cause a ratings downgrade in such holdings which, in
    turn, would cause an increase in unrealized losses on such
    securities. See ‘‘— We Are Exposed to
    Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May
    Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition
    and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from
    Period to Period.” Finally, the choices made by the
    U.S. Treasury in its distribution of amounts available
    under the EESA could have the effect of supporting some parts of
    the financial system more than others. See
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability.”

MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible
    to sell assets to the U.S. Treasury under one or more of
    the programs established under EESA, and some of their assets
    may be among those the U.S. Treasury offers to purchase,
    either directly or through auction. Furthermore, as a bank
    holding company, MetLife, Inc. could be selected to participate
    in the U.S. Treasury’s capital infusion program,
    pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury purchases preferred
    shares of banking institutions or their holding companies and
    acquires warrants for their common shares. If we choose to
    participate in the capital infusion program of the U.S.
    Treasury, we will become subject to requirements and
    restrictions on our business. Issuing preferred shares and
    warrants could dilute the ownership interests of stockholders or
    affect our ability to raise capital in other transactions. We
    will also become subject to restrictions on the compensation
    that we can offer or pay to certain executive employees,
    including incentives or performance-based compensation. These
    restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and
    retaining management with the talent and experience to manage
    our business effectively. Limits on our ability to deduct
    certain compensation paid to executive employees will also be
    imposed. The remaining $350 billion authorized by the EESA
    has been made available to the U.S. Treasury. Congress and
    the current Administration are considering the imposition of
    additional requirements and conditions on the use of these
    additional funds. See “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

On December 5, 2008, MetLife, Inc. elected to continue to
    participate in the debt guarantee component of the FDIC Program.
    Under the terms of the FDIC Program, the FDIC will guarantee
    through June 2012 (or maturity, if earlier) the payment of
    certain newly-issued senior unsecured debt of MetLife, Inc. and
    any eligible affiliates. We also notified the FDIC that we have
    elected the option of excluding specified senior unsecured debt
    maturing after June 30, 2012, from the guarantee before
    reaching the limits on the amount of guaranteed debt under the
    FDIC Program ($398 million for MetLife, Inc. and
    $178 million for its affiliate, MetLife Bank, N.A., which
    may issue guaranteed debt under its limit, as well as unused
    amounts under MetLife, Inc.’s limit). In addition, we opted
    out of the component of the FDIC Program that guarantees
    non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts. We cannot
    predict how the markets may react to these elections or to any
    debt issued subject to the terms of the FDIC Program. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Extraordinary Market
    Conditions.”



The
    Impairment of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely
    Affect Us

We have exposure to many different industries and
    counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with
    counterparties in the financial services industry, including
    brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge
    funds and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of
    these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of
    default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to
    secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when
    the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at
    prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or
    derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these
    financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt
    instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities,
    derivative transactions and equity investments. Further,
    potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in
    response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking
    system and financial markets, such as investment,
    nationalization and other intervention, could negatively impact
    these instruments, securities, transactions and investments.
    There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to
    the carrying value of these assets would not materially and
    adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our
    Participation in a Securities Lending Program Subjects Us to
    Potential Liquidity and Other Risks

We participate in a securities lending program whereby blocks of
    securities, which are included in fixed maturity securities and
    short-term investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily
    major brokerage firms and commercial banks. We generally require
    collateral equal to 102% of the current estimated fair value of
    the loaned securities to be obtained at the inception of a loan,
    and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the
    duration of the loan. During the extraordinary market events
    occurring in the fourth quarter of 2008, we, in limited
    instances, accepted collateral less than 102% at the inception
    of certain loans, but never less than 100%, of the estimated
    fair value of such loaned securities. These loans involved
    U.S. Government Treasury Bills which we considered to have
    limited variation in their estimated fair value during the term
    of the loan. Securities with a cost or amortized cost of
    $20.8 billion and $41.1 billion and an estimated fair
    value of $22.9 billion and $42.1 billion were on loan
    under the program at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, respectively. Securities loaned under
    such transactions may be sold or repledged by the transferee. We
    were liable for cash collateral under our control of
    $23.3 billion and $43.3 billion at December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.

Returns of loaned securities by the third parties would require
    us to return the cash collateral associated with such loaned
    securities. In addition, in some cases, the maturity of the
    securities held as invested collateral (i.e., securities that we
    have purchased with cash received from the third parties) may
    exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the
    estimated fair value may fall below the amount of cash received
    as collateral and invested. If we are required to return
    significant amounts of cash collateral on short notice and we
    are forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation, we
    may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in
    securities in a timely manner, be forced to sell securities in a
    volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would
    have been able to realize under normal market conditions, or
    both. In addition, under stressful capital market and economic
    conditions, such as those conditions we have experienced
    recently, liquidity broadly deteriorates, which may further
    restrict our ability to sell securities.

Of this $23.3 billion of cash collateral at
    December 31, 2008, $5.1 billion was on open terms,
    meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us
    on the next business day requiring return of cash collateral and
    the following amounts are due within 30 days, and
    60 days — $14.7 billion and
    $3.5 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of the
    securities related to the cash collateral on open at
    December 31, 2008 has been reduced to $5.0 billion
    from $15.8 billion as of November 30, 2008. Of the
    $5.0 billion of estimated fair value of the securities
    related to the cash collateral on open at December 31,
    2008, $4.4 billion were U.S. Treasury and agency
    securities which, if put to us, can be immediately sold to
    satisfy the cash requirements. The remainder of the securities
    on loan are primarily U.S. Treasury and agency securities,
    and very liquid residential mortgage-backed securities. Within
    the U.S. Treasury securities on loan, they are primarily
    holdings of on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities, the most
    liquid U.S. Treasury securities available. If these high
    quality securities that are on loan are put back to us, the
    proceeds from immediately selling these securities can be used
    to satisfy the related cash requirements. The estimated fair
    value of the reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash
    collateral was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2008, and
    consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including
    residential mortgage-backed, asset-backed, U.S. corporate
    and foreign corporate securities). If the on loan securities or
    the



reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, we have the liquidity
    resources of most of our general account available to meet any
    potential cash demand when securities are put back to us. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments — Securities Lending.”

If we decrease the amount of our securities lending activities
    over time, the amount of income generated by these activities
    will also likely decline.

We Are
    Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk which
    May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial
    Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary
    from Period to Period

We are exposed to significant financial and capital markets
    risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange
    rates, market volatility, the performance of the economy in
    general, the performance of the specific obligors included in
    our portfolio and other factors outside our control. Our
    exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market
    price and cash flow variability associated with changes in
    interest rates. A rise in interest rates will increase the net
    unrealized loss position of our fixed income investment
    portfolio and, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically
    within a six to twelve month time period, certain of our life
    insurance businesses may be exposed to disintermediation risk.
    Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that our policyholders
    may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate
    environment, requiring us to liquidate fixed income investments
    in an unrealized loss position. Due to the long-term nature of
    the liabilities associated with certain of our life insurance
    businesses, guaranteed benefits on variable annuities, and
    structured settlements, sustained declines in long-term interest
    rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging
    costs. In other situations, declines in interest rates may
    result in increasing the duration of certain life insurance
    liabilities, creating asset liability duration mismatches. Our
    investment portfolio also contains interest rate sensitive
    instruments, such as fixed income securities, which may be
    adversely affected by changes in interest rates from
    governmental monetary policies, domestic and international
    economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our
    control. A rise in interest rates would increase the net
    unrealized loss position of our fixed income investment
    portfolio, offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return
    on funds reinvested. Conversely, a decline in interest rates
    would decrease the net unrealized loss position of our fixed
    income investment portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on
    funds reinvested. Our mitigation efforts with respect to
    interest rate risk are primarily focused towards maintaining an
    investment portfolio with diversified maturities that has a
    weighted average duration that is approximately equal to the
    duration of our estimated liability cash flow profile. However,
    our estimate of the liability cash flow profile may be
    inaccurate and we may be forced to liquidate fixed income
    investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the
    liability. Although we take measures to manage the economic
    risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we
    may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our fixed
    income investments relative to our liabilities. See also
    “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”

Our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price
    and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit
    spreads. A widening of credit spreads will increase the net
    unrealized loss position of the fixed income investment
    portfolio, will increase losses associated with credit based
    non-qualifying derivatives where we assume credit exposure, and,
    if issuer credit spreads increase significantly or for an
    extended period of time, would likely result in higher
    other-than-temporary impairments. Credit spread tightening will
    reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of
    fixed maturity securities. In addition, market volatility can
    make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading
    becomes less frequent. As such, valuations may include
    assumptions or estimates that may have significant period to
    period changes which could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
    Credit spreads on both corporate and structured securities
    widened during 2008, resulting in continuing depressed pricing.
    Continuing challenges include continued weakness in the
    U.S. real estate market and increased mortgage
    delinquencies, investor anxiety over the U.S. economy,
    rating agency downgrades of various structured products and
    financial issuers, unresolved issues with structured investment
    vehicles and monoline financial guarantee insurers, deleveraging
    of financial institutions and hedge funds and a serious
    dislocation in the inter-bank market. If significant, continued
    volatility, changes in interest rates, changes in credit spreads
    and defaults, a lack of pricing transparency, market liquidity,
    declines in equity prices, and the strengthening or weakening of
    foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, individually or
    in tandem, could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of



operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized
    losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.

Our primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for
    lower earnings associated with certain of our insurance
    businesses, such as variable annuities, where fee income is
    earned based upon the estimated fair value of the assets under
    management. In addition, certain of our annuity products offer
    guaranteed benefits which increase our potential benefit
    exposure should equity markets decline. We are also exposed to
    interest rate and equity risk based upon the discount rate and
    expected long-term rate of return assumptions associated with
    our pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations.
    Sustained declines in long-term interest rates or equity returns
    likely would have a negative effect on the funded status of
    these plans.

Our exposure to real estate risk relates to market price and
    cash flow variability associated with changes in real estate
    markets, default and bankruptcy rates, geographic and sector
    concentration as well as illiquidity of real estate investments.
    The current economic environment has led to significant
    weakening of the residential and commercial real estate markets,
    increases in foreclosures, bankruptcies and unsuccessful
    development projects as well as limited access to credit. Our
    real estate investments, including those held by joint ventures
    and real estate funds, may be negatively impacted by weakened
    local real estate conditions, such as oversupply, reduced demand
    and the availability and creditworthiness of current and
    prospective tenants and borrowers. In addition, real estate
    investments are relatively illiquid, and could limit our
    ability, and that of our joint venture partners and real estate
    fund managers, to sell assets to respond to changing economic,
    financial and investment conditions. Also, these factors could
    impact mortgage and consumer loan fundamentals which are further
    discussed under “— Defaults on Our Mortgage and
    Consumer Loans and Volatility in Performance May Adversely
    Affect Our Profitability.” These factors and others beyond
    our control could have a material adverse effect on our
    consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash
    flows through net investment income, realized losses and
    impairments.

Our primary foreign currency exchange risks are described under
    “— Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange
    Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could Negatively Affect our
    Profitability.” Significant declines in equity prices,
    changes in U.S. interest rates, changes in credit spreads,
    and changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a
    material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
    operations, financial condition or liquidity. Changes in these
    factors, which are significant risks to us, can affect our net
    investment income in any period, and such changes can be
    substantial.

We invest a portion of our invested assets in leveraged buy-out
    funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds reported
    within Other Limited Partnerships, many of which make private
    equity investments. The amount and timing of net investment
    income from such investment funds tends to be uneven as a result
    of the performance of the underlying investments, including
    private equity investments. The timing of distributions from the
    funds, which depends on particular events relating to the
    underlying investments, as well as the funds’ schedules for
    making distributions and their needs for cash, can be difficult
    to predict. As a result, the amount of net investment income
    that we record from these investments can vary substantially
    from quarter to quarter. Recent equity, real estate and credit
    market volatility have further reduced net investment income and
    related yields for these types of investments and we may
    continue to experience reduced net investment income due to
    continued volatility in the equity, real estate and credit
    markets in 2009. In addition, due to the normal lag in the
    preparation of and then receipt of periodic financial statements
    from other limited partnership interests and real estate joint
    ventures and funds, results from late 2008 during periods of
    volatility will be reported to us in 2009.

Our
    Requirements to Pledge Collateral or Make Payments Related to
    Declines in Value of Specified Assets May Adversely Affect Our
    Liquidity and Expose Us to Counterparty Credit
    Risk

Many of our transactions with financial and other institutions
    specify the circumstances under which the parties are required
    to pledge collateral related to any decline in the value of the
    specified assets. In addition, under the terms of some of our
    transactions, we may be required to make payments to our
    counterparties related to any decline in the value of the
    specified assets. The amount of collateral we may be required to
    pledge and the payments we may be required to make under these
    agreements may increase under certain circumstances, which could
    adversely affect our liquidity.



In December 2007, we entered into an agreement with an
    unaffiliated financial institution that referenced
    $2.5 billion of

35-year

surplus notes issued by MetLife Reinsurance Company of
    Charleston (“MRC”). Based on the decline in the
    estimated fair value of MRC’s surplus notes, we have
    pledged collateral and made payments to the unaffiliated
    financial institution. We may in the future be required to
    pledge additional collateral or make additional payments to this
    unaffiliated financial institution based on any further declines
    in the estimated fair value of MRC’s surplus notes. Any
    collateral pledged by us under the agreement is required to be
    held in a segregated account and remains on our balance sheet.
    Any payments to the unaffiliated financial institution may
    reduce the amount under the agreement on which our interest
    payment was due but may not reduce the principal amount of the
    surplus notes. Such payments have been accounted for as a
    receivable and will not be realized until the termination of the
    agreement with the unaffiliated financial institution.
    Furthermore, with respect to any such payments, we have
    unsecured risk to the unaffiliated financial institution as
    these amounts are not required to be held in a third-party
    custodial account or segregated from the unaffiliated financial
    institution’s funds. Such collateral pledged and payments
    could have an adverse effect on our liquidity. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Uses — Collateral Financing
    Arrangements” and Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
    Statutory Reserve Financings May be Subject to Cost Increases
    and New Financings May be Subject to Limited Market
    Capacity

To support our level premium term life and universal life with
    secondary guarantees businesses and MLIC’s closed block, we
    currently utilize capital markets solutions for financing a
    portion of our statutory reserve requirements. While we have
    financing facilities in place for our previously written
    business and have remaining capacity in existing facilities to
    support writings through the end of 2009 or later, certain of
    these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the
    occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of MetLife or are
    subject to periodic repricing. Any resulting cost increases
    could negatively impact our financial results.

Further, the capacity for these reserve funding structures
    available in the current marketplace is limited. If capacity
    continues to be limited for a prolonged period of time, our
    ability to obtain new funding for these structures may be
    hindered, and as a result, our ability to write additional
    business in a cost effective manner may be impacted.

Defaults
    on Our Mortgage and Consumer Loans and Volatility in Performance
    May Adversely Affect Our Profitability

Our mortgage and consumer loans face default risk and are
    principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and
    residential properties, as well as automobiles. The carrying
    value of mortgage and consumer loans is stated at original cost
    net of repayments, amortization of premiums, accretion of
    discounts and valuation allowances, except for residential
    mortgage loans held-for-sale accounted for under the fair value
    option which are carried at estimated fair value, as determined
    on a recurring basis and certain commercial and residential
    mortgage loans carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair
    value, as determined on a nonrecurring basis. We establish
    valuation allowances for estimated impairments as of the balance
    sheet date. Such valuation allowances are based on the excess
    carrying value of the loan over the present value of expected
    future cash flows discounted at the loan’s original
    effective interest rate, the value of the loan’s collateral
    if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise
    collateral dependent, or the loan’s estimated fair value if
    the loan is held-for-sale. We also establish allowances for loan
    losses when a loss contingency exists for pools of loans with
    similar characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on similar
    property types or loan to value risk factors. At
    December 31, 2008, loans that were either delinquent or in
    the process of foreclosure totaled less than 0.5% of our
    mortgage and consumer loan investments. The performance of our
    mortgage and consumer loan investments, however, may fluctuate
    in the future. In addition, substantially all of our mortgage
    loans held-for-investment have balloon payment maturities. An
    increase in the default rate of our mortgage and consumer loan
    investments could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments — Mortgage and Consumer Loans.”

Further, any geographic or sector concentration of our mortgage
    or consumer loans may have adverse effects on our investment
    portfolios and consequently on our consolidated results of
    operations or financial condition.



While we seek to mitigate this risk by having a broadly
    diversified portfolio, events or developments that have a
    negative effect on any particular geographic region or sector
    may have a greater adverse effect on the investment portfolios
    to the extent that the portfolios are concentrated. Moreover,
    our ability to sell assets relating to such particular groups of
    related assets may be limited if other market participants are
    seeking to sell at the same time. In addition, legislative
    proposals that would allow or require modifications to the terms
    of mortgage loans could be enacted. We cannot predict whether
    these proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such
    proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business
    or investments.

Our
    Investments are Reflected Within the Consolidated Financial
    Statements Utilizing Different Accounting Basis and Accordingly
    We May Not Have Recognized Differences, Which May Be
    Significant, Between Cost and Estimated Fair Value in our
    Consolidated Financial Statements

Our principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity
    securities, trading securities, short-term investments, mortgage
    and consumer loans, policy loans, real estate, real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnerships and other invested
    assets. The carrying value of such investments is as follows:

•

Fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as
    available-for-sale, except for trading securities, and are
    reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized investment
    gains and losses on these securities are recorded as a separate
    component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of
    policyholder related amounts and deferred income taxes.

•

Trading securities are recorded at estimated fair value with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income.

•

Short-term investments include investments with remaining
    maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months,
    at the time of acquisition and are stated at amortized cost,
    which approximates estimated fair value.

•

The carrying value of mortgage and consumer loans is stated at
    original cost net of repayments, amortization of premiums,
    accretion of discounts and valuation allowances, except for
    residential mortgage loans held-for-sale accounted for under the
    fair value option which are carried at estimated fair value, as
    determined on a recurring basis and certain commercial and
    residential mortgage loans carried at the lower of cost or
    estimated fair value, as determined on a nonrecurring basis.

•

Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.

•

Real estate held-for-investment, including related improvements,
    is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.

•

Real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which we have more than a minor equity interest or
    more than a minor influence over the joint ventures or
    partnership’s operations, but where we do not have a
    controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, are
    carried using the equity method of accounting. We use the cost
    method of accounting for investments in real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnership interests in which it has
    a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over the
    joint ventures or the partnership’s operations.

•

Other invested assets consist principally of freestanding
    derivatives with positive estimated fair values and leveraged
    leases. Freestanding derivatives are carried at estimated fair
    value with changes in estimated fair value reflected in income
    for both non-qualifying derivatives and derivatives in fair
    value hedging relationships. Derivatives in cash flow hedging
    relationships are reflected as a separate component of other
    comprehensive income (loss). Leveraged leases are recorded net
    of non-recourse debt.

Investments not carried at estimated fair value in our
    consolidated financial statements — principally,
    mortgage and consumer loans held-for-investment, policy loans,
    real estate, real estate joint ventures, other limited
    partnerships and leveraged leases — may have estimated
    fair values which are substantially higher or lower than the
    carrying value reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements. Each of such asset classes is regularly evaluated
    for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the
    respective asset class.



Our
    Valuation of Fixed Maturity, Equity and Trading Securities May
    Include Methodologies, Estimations and Assumptions Which Are
    Subject to Differing Interpretations and Could Result in Changes
    to Investment Valuations that May Materially Adversely Affect
    Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition

Fixed maturity, equity, trading securities and short-term
    investments which are reported at estimated fair value on the
    consolidated balance sheet represent the majority of our total
    cash and invested assets. We have categorized these securities
    into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the
    inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value
    hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities
    (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable
    inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability’s
    classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the
    lowest level of significant input to its valuation.
    SFAS 157 defines the input levels as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. We define active markets based on average
    trading volume for equity securities. The size of the bid/ask
    spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed
    maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or
    liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of fair value
    requires significant management judgment or estimation.

At December 31, 2008, 11%, 80% and 9% of these securities
    represented Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3,
    respectively. The Level 1 securities primarily consist of
    certain U.S. Treasury and agency fixed maturity securities;
    exchange-traded common stock, and certain short-term
    investments. The Level 2 assets include fixed maturity
    securities priced principally through independent pricing
    services using observable inputs. These fixed maturity
    securities include most U.S. Treasury and agency securities
    as well as the majority of U.S. and foreign corporate
    securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial
    mortgage-backed securities, state and political subdivision
    securities, foreign government securities, and asset-backed
    securities. Equity securities classified as Level 2
    primarily consist principally of non-redeemable preferred
    securities and certain equity securities where market quotes are
    available but are not considered actively traded and are priced
    by independent pricing services. Management reviews the
    valuation methodologies used by the independent pricing services
    on an ongoing basis and ensures that any changes to valuation
    methodologies are justified. Level 3 assets include fixed
    maturity securities priced principally through independent
    non-binding broker quotations or market standard valuation
    methodologies using inputs that are not market observable or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data. This level consists of less liquid fixed maturity
    securities with very limited trading activity or where less
    price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation
    methodologies including: U.S. and foreign corporate
    securities — including below investment grade private
    placements; residential mortgage-backed securities; and asset
    backed securities — including all of those supported
    by sub-prime mortgage loans. Equity securities classified as
    Level 3 securities consist principally of common stock of
    privately held companies and non-redeemable preferred securities
    where there has been very limited trading activity or where less
    price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation.
    See Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for the estimated fair values of these assets and
    liabilities by hierarchy level.

Prices provided by independent pricing services and independent
    non-binding broker quotations can vary widely even for the same
    security.



The determination of estimated fair values by management in the
    absence of quoted market prices is based on: (i) valuation
    methodologies; (ii) securities we deem to be comparable;
    and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given the
    circumstances. The fair value estimates are made at a specific
    point in time, based on available market information and
    judgments about financial instruments, including estimates of
    the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the
    credit standing of the issuer or counterparty. Factors
    considered in estimating fair value include: coupon rate,
    maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking fund
    requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer, and
    quoted market prices of comparable securities. The use of
    different methodologies and assumptions may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

During periods of market disruption including periods of
    significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening
    credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value
    certain of our securities, for example Alt-A and sub-prime
    mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed
    securities, if trading becomes less frequent

and/or

market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset
    classes that were in active markets with significant observable
    data that become illiquid due to the current financial
    environment. In such cases, more securities may fall to
    Level 3 and thus require more subjectivity and management
    judgment. As such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions
    that are less observable or require greater estimation as well
    as valuation methods which are more sophisticated or require
    greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may be
    greater or less than the value at which the investments may be
    ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented
    credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the
    valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated
    financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value
    could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    condition.

Some
    of Our Investments Are Relatively Illiquid and Are in Asset
    Classes that Have Been Experiencing Significant Market Valuation
    Fluctuations

We hold certain investments that may lack liquidity, such as
    privately placed fixed maturity securities; mortgage and
    consumer loans; policy loans and leveraged leases; equity real
    estate, including real estate joint ventures; and other limited
    partnership interests. These asset classes represented 33.7% of
    the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets at
    December 31, 2008. Even some of our very high quality
    assets have been more illiquid as a result of the recent
    challenging market conditions.

If we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in
    excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or
    return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio,
    derivatives transactions or securities lending activities, we
    may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely
    manner, be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would
    have been able to realize, or both.

The reported value of our relatively illiquid types of
    investments, our investments in the asset classes described
    above and, at times, our high quality, generally liquid asset
    classes, do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market
    price for the asset. If we were forced to sell certain of our
    assets in the current market, there can be no assurance that we
    will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have
    recorded them and we may be forced to sell them at significantly
    lower prices.

The
    Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken
    on Our Investments is Highly Subjective and Could Materially
    Impact Our Results of Operations or Financial
    Position

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments
    varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly
    and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations
    as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that
    our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments
    taken and allowances reflected in our consolidated financial
    statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be
    taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical
    trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.

For example, the cost of our fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be
    other-than-temporary in the period in which the determination is
    made. The assessment of whether impairments



have occurred is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The review of our fixed maturity and
    equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the
    total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities:
    (i) securities where the estimated fair value has declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%;
    (ii) securities where the estimated fair value has declined
    and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for
    less than six months; and (iii) securities where the
    estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.

Additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors
    about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in
    evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value
    of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term
    recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the
    security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of
    the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in
    the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited
    to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the
    market value has been below cost or amortized cost;
    (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the
    issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties;
    (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry
    sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in
    certain economically depressed geographic locations;
    (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the
    issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a
    catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources;
    (vi) our ability and intent to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value
    to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost;
    (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and
    (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations
    and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

Gross
    Unrealized Losses on Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities May be
    Realized or Result in Future Impairments, Resulting in a
    Reduction in Our Net Income

Fixed maturity and equity securities classified as
    available-for-sale, except trading securities, are reported at
    their estimated fair value. Unrealized gains or losses on
    available-for-sale securities are recognized as a component of
    other comprehensive income (loss) and are, therefore, excluded
    from net income. Our gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity
    and equity securities at December 31, 2008 were
    $29.8 billion. The portion of the $29.8 billion of
    gross unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities
    where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below
    amortized cost or cost by 20% or more for six months or greater
    was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The accumulated
    change in estimated fair value of these available-for-sale
    securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is
    realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the
    decline in estimated fair value is determined to be
    other-than-temporary and an impairment charge is taken. Realized
    losses or impairments may have a material adverse affect on our
    net income in a particular quarterly or annual period.

Changes
    in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability

Some of our products, principally traditional whole life
    insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed investment contracts
    (“GICs”), expose us to the risk that changes in
    interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or the
    difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under
    the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we
    are able to earn on general account investments intended to
    support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key
    component of our net income.

As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be
    forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured
    or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our
    investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the
    fixed-income securities, commercial mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with
    greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates,
    which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates
    can help offset decreases in investment margins on some
    products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be
    limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates
    and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset
    yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially
    become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an
    important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA and
    significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate
    amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected
    reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining
    interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be
    relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting
    in increased premium payments on products



with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and
    increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance
    policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period
    when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in
    market interest rates could also reduce our return on
    investments that do not support particular policy obligations.
    Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially adversely
    affect our results of operations, financial position and cash
    flows and significantly reduce our profitability.

The sufficiency of our reserves in Taiwan is highly sensitive to
    interest rates and other related assumptions. This is due to the
    sustained low interest rate environment in Taiwan coupled with
    long-term interest rate guarantees of approximately 6% embedded
    in the life and health contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack
    of availability of long-duration assets in the Taiwanese capital
    markets to match such long-duration liabilities. The key
    assumptions utilized include that current Taiwan government bond
    yield rates increase from current levels of 1.6% to 2.7% over
    the next ten years, mortality and morbidity levels remain
    consistent with recent experience and that U.S. dollar
    assets make up 35% of total assets backing reserves. Current
    reserve adequacy analysis shows that provisions are adequate;
    however, adverse changes in key assumptions for interest rates,
    exchange rates, and mortality and morbidity levels or lapse
    rates could lead to a need to strengthen reserves and therefore
    for additional capital.

Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect
    our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest
    rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the
    assets in MetLife’s general account with higher yielding
    assets needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to
    keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may
    have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or
    face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts
    and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and
    withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek
    investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates
    rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we
    sell invested assets at a time when the prices of those assets
    are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates,
    which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated
    withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the
    amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would increase our current
    expenses and reduce net income. An increase in market interest
    rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of
    our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the
    estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that
    comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio.

Consolidation
    of Distributors of Insurance Products May Adversely Affect the
    Insurance Industry and the Profitability of Our
    Business

The insurance industry distributes many of its individual
    products through other financial institutions such as banks and
    broker-dealers. As capital, credit and equity markets continue
    to experience volatility, bank and broker-dealer consolidation
    activity may increase and negatively impact the industry’s
    sales, and such consolidation could increase competition for
    access to distributors, result in greater distribution expenses
    and impair our ability to market insurance products to our
    current customer base or to expand our customer base.

Industry
    Trends Could Adversely Affect the Profitability of Our
    Businesses

Our business segments continue to be influenced by a variety of
    trends that affect the insurance industry, including intense
    competition with respect to product features, price,
    distribution capability, customer service and information
    technology. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Industry Trends.” The impact on our business and on the
    life insurance industry generally of the volatility and
    instability of the financial markets is difficult to predict,
    and our business plans, financial condition and results of
    operations may be negatively impacted or affected in other
    unexpected ways. In addition, the life insurance industry is
    subject to state regulation, and, as complex products are
    introduced, regulators may refine capital requirements and
    introduce new reserving standards. Furthermore, regulators have
    undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets
    or products, including equity-indexed annuities, variable
    annuities and group products. The current market environment may
    also lead to changes in regulation that may benefit or
    disadvantage us relative to some of our competitors. See
    “— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our
    Market Share and Profitability” and
    “Business — Competition.”



A
    Decline in Equity Markets or an Increase in Volatility in Equity
    Markets May Adversely Affect Sales of Our Investment Products
    and Our Profitability

Significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
    results of operations in three principal ways.

First, equity market downturns and volatility may discourage
    purchases of separate account products, such as variable
    annuities and variable life insurance that have underlying
    mutual funds with returns linked to the performance of the
    equity markets and may cause some of our existing customers to
    withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products.

Second, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a
    material adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our
    savings and investment products and services. Because these
    products and services depend on fees related primarily to the
    value of assets under management, a decline in the equity
    markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the
    investment assets we manage. The retail annuity business in
    particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a
    sustained weakness in the equity markets will decrease revenues
    and earnings in variable annuity products.

Third, we provide certain guarantees within some of our products
    that protect policyholders against significant downturns in the
    equity markets. For example, we offer variable annuity products
    with guaranteed features, such as death benefits, withdrawal
    benefits, and minimum accumulation and income benefits. In
    volatile or declining equity market conditions, we may need to
    increase liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholder
    account balances, negatively affecting net income.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well, We May Be Required to Recognize
    an Impairment of Our Goodwill or Other Long-Lived Assets or to
    Establish a Valuation Allowance Against the Deferred Income Tax
    Asset, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or
    Financial Condition

Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire
    subsidiaries and other businesses over the estimated fair value
    of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill
    at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is
    performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the
    “reporting unit” to which the goodwill relates. The
    reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level
    below that operating segment if discrete financial information
    is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level.
    The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by
    the performance of the business. The performance of our
    businesses may be adversely impacted by prolonged market
    declines. If it is determined that the goodwill has been
    impaired, MetLife must write down the goodwill by the amount of
    the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such
    write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position. See
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates —
    Goodwill.”

Long-lived assets, including assets such as real estate, also
    require impairment testing to determine whether changes in
    circumstances indicate that MetLife will be unable to recover
    the carrying amount of the asset group through future operations
    of that asset group or market conditions that will impact the
    value of those assets. Such write downs could have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Deferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences
    between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities.
    Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to
    determine if they are realizable. Factors in management’s
    determination include the performance of the business including
    the ability to generate future taxable income. If based on
    available information, it is more likely than not that the
    deferred income tax asset will not be realized then a valuation
    allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net
    income. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Further or continued deterioration of financial market
    conditions could result in a decrease in the expected future
    earnings of our reporting units, which could lead to an
    impairment of some or all of the goodwill associated with them
    in future periods. Such deterioration could also result in the
    impairment of long-lived assets and the establishment of a
    valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets.



Competitive
    Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and
    Profitability

Our business segments are subject to intense competition. We
    believe that this competition is based on a number of factors,
    including service, product features, scale, price, financial
    strength, claims-paying ratings, credit ratings,

e-business

capabilities and name recognition. We compete with a large
    number of other insurers, as well as non-insurance financial
    services companies, such as banks, broker-dealers and asset
    managers, for individual consumers, employers and other group
    customers and agents and other distributors of insurance and
    investment products. Some of these companies offer a broader
    array of products, have more competitive pricing or, with
    respect to other insurers, have higher claims paying ability
    ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with
    which to compete. National banks, which may sell annuity
    products of life insurers in some circumstances, also have
    pre-existing customer bases for financial services products.

Many of our insurance products, particularly those offered by
    our Institutional segment, are underwritten annually, and,
    accordingly, there is a risk that group purchasers may be able
    to obtain more favorable terms from competitors rather than
    renewing coverage with us. The effect of competition may, as a
    result, adversely affect the persistency of these and other
    products, as well as our ability to sell products in the future.

In addition, the investment management and securities brokerage
    businesses have relatively few barriers to entry and continually
    attract new entrants. Many of our competitors in these
    businesses offer a broader array of investment products and
    services and are better known than we are as sellers of
    annuities and other investment products. See
    “Business — Competition.”

Finally, the choices made by the U.S. Treasury in the
    administration of EESA and in its distribution of amounts
    available thereunder could have the effect of supporting some
    parts of the financial system more than others. See
    ‘‘— There Can be No Assurance that Actions
    of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of
    Stabilizing the Financial Markets Will Achieve the Intended
    Effect.”

We May
    be Unable to Attract and Retain Sales Representatives for Our
    Products

We must attract and retain productive sales representatives to
    sell our insurance, annuities and investment products. Strong
    competition exists among insurers for sales representatives with
    demonstrated ability. In addition, there is competition for
    representatives with other types of financial services firms,
    such as independent broker-dealers. We compete with other
    insurers for sales representatives primarily on the basis of our
    financial position, support services and compensation and
    product features. We continue to undertake several initiatives
    to grow our career agency force while continuing to enhance the
    efficiency and production of our existing sales force. We cannot
    provide assurance that these initiatives will succeed in
    attracting and retaining new agents. Sales of individual
    insurance, annuities and investment products and our results of
    operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
    affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining
    agents. See “Business — Competition.”

Differences
    Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving
    Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial
    Results

Our earnings significantly depend upon the extent to which our
    actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we
    use in setting prices for our products and establishing
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims. Our
    liabilities for future policy benefits and claims are
    established based on estimates by actuaries of how much we will
    need to pay for future benefits and claims. For life insurance
    and annuity products, we calculate these liabilities based on
    many assumptions and estimates, including estimated premiums to
    be received over the assumed life of the policy, the timing of
    the event covered by the insurance policy, the amount of
    benefits or claims to be paid and the investment returns on the
    assets we purchase with the premiums we receive. We establish
    liabilities for property and casualty claims and benefits based
    on assumptions and estimates of damages and liabilities
    incurred. To the extent that actual claims experience is less
    favorable than the underlying assumptions we used in
    establishing such liabilities, we could be required to increase
    our liabilities.

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for
    future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely
    the amounts which we will



ultimately pay to settle our liabilities. Such amounts may vary
    from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may
    not occur until well into the future. We evaluate our
    liabilities periodically based on changes in the assumptions
    used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual
    experience. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to
    expenses in the period the liabilities are established or
    re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for
    future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them.
    Such increases could affect earnings negatively and have a
    material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
    and financial condition.

Our
    Risk Management Policies and Procedures May Leave Us Exposed to
    Unidentified or Unanticipated Risk, Which Could Negatively
    Affect Our Business

Management of risk requires, among other things, policies and
    procedures to record properly and verify a large number of
    transactions and events. We have devoted significant resources
    to develop our risk management policies and procedures and
    expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
    policies and procedures may not be comprehensive. Many of our
    methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use
    of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on
    historical models. As a result, these methods may not fully
    predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater
    than our historical measures indicate. Other risk management
    methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding
    markets, clients, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that
    is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This
    information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or
    properly evaluated. See “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Change
    in Our Discount Rate, Expected Rate of Return and Expected
    Compensation Increase Assumptions for Our Pension and Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plans May Result in Increased Expenses
    and Reduce Our Profitability

We determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plan
    costs based on our best estimates of future plan experience.
    These assumptions are reviewed regularly and include discount
    rates, expected rates of return on plan assets and expected
    increases in compensation levels and expected medical inflation.
    Changes in these assumptions may result in increased expenses
    and reduce our profitability. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefit
    Plans” and Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for details on how changes in these
    assumptions would affect plan costs.

Catastrophes
    May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and
    Reinsurance Availability

Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of
    catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that
    causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics
    have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the
    likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be
    predicted. The effectiveness of external parties, including
    governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating
    the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material
    impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group insurance
    operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one
    or more of our group insurance customers could cause a
    significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims. These
    events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could
    also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.

Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will
    likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may
    have a material adverse impact on the business, results of
    operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home
    segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to
    manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility
    management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not
    eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various
    events, including pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms,
    earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather
    (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards),
    fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks.
    Historically, substantially all of our catastrophe-related
    claims have related to homeowners coverages. However,
    catastrophes may also affect other Auto & Home
    coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence,
    timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition, changing
    climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be
    increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and
    severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes.



Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our
    homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include
    coastal sections of the northeastern United States (including
    lower New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts),
    the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and
    Texas) and Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure,
    primarily along the New Madrid fault line in the central United
    States and in the Pacific Northwest.

The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both
    the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the
    event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are
    restricted to small geographic areas; however, pandemics,
    hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce
    significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are
    heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made
    catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our
    financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could
    materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial
    condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial
    condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability
    of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new
    business could also be affected. It is possible that increases
    in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other
    factors, and geographic concentration of insured property, could
    increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the
    future.

Most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries
    are admitted to transact business require life and property and
    casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to
    participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay
    contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued
    by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations
    levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member
    insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate
    share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of
    business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is
    engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or
    controlled organizations providing life and property and
    casualty insurance to their citizens. The activities of such
    organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy
    of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also
    have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the
    guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member
    insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial
    premium tax offsets. See “Business —
    Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty
    Associations and Similar Arrangements.”

While in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied
    against MetLife have not been material, it is possible that a
    large catastrophic event could render such guaranty funds
    inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional
    amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations in a particular period. We
    have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that
    we consider adequate for assessments with respect to insurers
    that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings, but
    additional liabilities may be necessary. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Insolvency
    Assessments.”

Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we
    establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only
    after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We
    cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will
    be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to
    time, states have passed legislation that has the effect of
    limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as
    legislation restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw
    from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our
    exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed
    by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or
    multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, results of operations and financial
    condition.

Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our
    property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in
    part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may
    not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future.
    See “— Reinsurance May Not Be Available,
    Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses.”

A
    Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or
    Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Financial strength ratings, which various Nationally Recognized
    Statistical Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) publish as
    indicators of an insurance company’s ability to meet
    contractholder and policyholder



obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in
    our products, our ability to market our products and our
    competitive position. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Insurer Financial Strength Ratings.”

Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations in many ways, including:

•

reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other
    investment products;

•

adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and
    independent sales intermediaries;

•

materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders
    and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;

•

requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and
    services to remain competitive; and

•

adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at
    reasonable prices or at all.

In addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance
    subsidiaries, various NRSROs also publish credit ratings for
    MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries. Credit ratings
    are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms
    of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors
    in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain
    types of liquidity. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Credit Ratings.” Downgrades in our
    credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations in many ways,
    including adversely limiting our access to capital markets,
    potentially increasing the cost of debt, and requiring us to
    post collateral. A two-notch decrease in the financial strength
    ratings of our insurance company subsidiaries would require us
    to post less than $200 million of collateral in connection
    with derivative collateral arrangements, to which we are a party
    and would have allowed holders of $500 million aggregate
    account value of our funding agreements to terminate such
    funding agreements on 90 days’ notice.

In view of the difficulties experienced recently by many
    financial institutions, including our competitors in the
    insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs
    will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such
    institutions, will increase the frequency and scope of their
    credit reviews, will request additional information from the
    companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and
    other requirements employed in the NRSRO models for maintenance
    of certain ratings levels. Rating agencies use an “outlook
    statement” of “positive,” “stable,”
    “negative” or “developing” to indicate a
    medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if
    continued, may lead to a ratings change. A rating may have a
    “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not
    expected to change; however, a “stable” rating does
    not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time,
    without notice. Certain rating agencies have recently revised
    their outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector, as well as
    MetLife, Inc.’s and certain of its subsidiaries’
    insurer financial strength and credit ratings, from
    “stable” to “negative.” Furthermore, the
    insurer financial strength and credit ratings of MetLife, Inc.
    and certain of its subsidiaries have also been recently
    downgraded. See “Business — Company
    Ratings — Rating Actions.”

We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what
    actions we may take in response to the actions of rating
    agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with
    other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings
    could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any
    NRSRO.

An
    Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a
    Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit
    and Financial Strength Ratings

We have a $2.85 billion five-year revolving credit facility
    that matures in June 2012, as well as other facilities which we
    enter into in the ordinary course of business. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
    Capital Resources — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Credit Facilities” and
    “— Committed Facilities.”

We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of
    liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be
    critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our
    ability to meet our obligations as they come due, particularly
    in the current market when alternative sources of credit are
    tight. The credit facilities contain certain administrative,
    reporting, legal and financial covenants. We must comply with
    certain covenants under our credit



facilities (including the $2.85 billion five-year revolving
    credit facility) that require us to maintain a specified minimum
    consolidated net worth.

Our right to make borrowings under these facilities is subject
    to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including
    our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow is
    also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the
    lenders that are parties to the facilities to provide funds. Our
    failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or
    fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders
    to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency,
    illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under
    the terms of the facilities, would restrict our ability to
    access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently,
    could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
    and results of operations.

Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Products that Protect Policyholders
    Against Significant Downturns in Equity Markets May Decrease Our
    Earnings, Increase the Volatility of Our Results if Hedging or
    Risk Management Strategies Prove Ineffective, Result in Higher
    Hedging Costs, Expose Us to Increased Counterparty Risk and
    Result in Our Own Credit Exposure

Certain of our variable annuity products include guaranteed
    benefit riders. These include guaranteed death benefits,
    guaranteed withdrawal benefits, lifetime withdrawal guarantees,
    guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits, and guaranteed minimum
    income benefit riders. Periods of significant and sustained
    downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility, or
    reduced interest rates could result in an increase in the
    valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder account
    balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in
    a reduction to net income. We use reinsurance in combination
    with derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure
    and the volatility of net income associated with these
    liabilities, and while we believe that these and other actions
    have mitigated the risks related to these benefits, we remain
    liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers
    or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. In
    addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other
    management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated
    policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market
    events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk
    management techniques employed. These, individually or
    collectively, may have a material adverse effect on net income,
    financial condition or liquidity. We are also subject to the
    risk that the cost of hedging these guaranteed minimum benefits
    increases, resulting in a reduction to net income. We also must
    consider our own credit standing, which is not hedged, in the
    valuation of certain of these liabilities. A decrease in our own
    credit spread could cause the value of these liabilities to
    increase, resulting in a reduction to net income.

If Our
    Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus
    Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC and VOBA Vary
    Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization
    and/or Impair the DAC and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our
    Results of Operations or Financial Condition

We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and
    renewal business. Those costs that vary with and are primarily
    related to the production of new and renewal business are
    deferred and referred to as DAC. The recovery of DAC is
    dependent upon the future profitability of the related business.
    The amount of future profit or margin is dependent principally
    on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest
    crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to
    administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance
    counterparties and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment
    returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of
    such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into
    management’s estimates of gross profits or margins, which
    generally are used to amortize such costs. If the estimates of
    gross profits or margins were overstated, then the amortization
    of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual
    experience is known and would result in a charge to income.
    Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in
    an acceleration of amortization of the DAC related to variable
    annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a
    charge to income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse
    effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

VOBA reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in
    a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion
    of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the
    right to receive future cash flows from the insurance and
    annuity contracts in-force at the acquisition date. VOBA is
    based on actuarially determined



projections. Actual experience may vary from the projections.
    Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed
    in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and
    could result in an impairment and a charge to income. Also, as
    VOBA is amortized similarly to DAC, an acceleration of the
    amortization of VOBA would occur if the estimates of gross
    profits or margins were overstated. Accordingly, the
    amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period in
    which the actual experience is known and would result in a
    charge to net income. Significant or sustained equity market
    declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of the
    VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life
    contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such adjustments
    could have a material adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial condition.

See “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired”
    for further consideration of DAC and VOBA and the impact of
    current market events during 2008.

Defaults,
    Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Value of Our Fixed
    Maturity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our
    Earnings

We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of
    fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and
    interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk
    that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities,
    including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal
    and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows
    paid to our investment. At December 31, 2008, the fixed
    maturity securities of $188.3 billion in our investment
    portfolio represented 58.4% of our total cash and invested
    assets. The occurrence of a major economic downturn (such as the
    current downturn in the economy), acts of corporate malfeasance,
    widening risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the
    issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities
    could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio
    and our net income to decline and the default rate of the fixed
    maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A
    ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular
    securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit
    quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities
    in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect.
    With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or
    guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings
    downgrade affecting a loan-backed security we hold could
    indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated.
    Any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a
    temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our
    business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels
    of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of
    the intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in
    value until recovery. If we determine to reposition or realign
    portions of the portfolio so as not to hold certain securities
    in an unrealized loss position to recovery, then we will incur
    an other than temporary impairment charge in the period that the
    decision was made not to hold the security to recovery. In
    addition, in January, 2009, Moody’s revised its loss
    projections for U.S. Alt-A residential mortgage-backed
    securities (RMBS), and it is anticipated that Moody’s will
    be downgrading virtually all 2006 and 2007 Alt-A securities to
    below investment grade, which will increase the percentage of
    our portfolio that will be rated below investment grade.

Fluctuations
    in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities
    Markets Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability

We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting
    from our holdings of

non-U.S. dollar

denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and
    net income from foreign operations. These risks relate to
    potential decreases in value and income resulting from a
    strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the
    U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign
    currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the
    value of our

non-U.S. dollar

denominated investments and our investments in foreign
    subsidiaries. Although we use foreign currency swaps and forward
    contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk, we
    cannot provide assurance that these methods will be effective or
    that our counterparties will perform their obligations. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

From time to time, various emerging market countries have
    experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including
    significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to
    foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in
    emerging markets.



We have matched substantially all of our foreign currency
    liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with assets denominated
    in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of
    currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results;
    however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of
    these results into our consolidated financial statements.
    Although we take certain actions to address this risk, foreign
    currency exchange rate fluctuation could materially adversely
    affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the
    failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the
    foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See
    “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
    Risk.”

Our
    International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and
    Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability

Our international operations face political, legal, operational
    and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations.
    We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization
    or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls
    or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds
    from these operations out of the countries in which they operate
    or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or
    other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are,
    and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where
    these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we
    rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter
    labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and
    trade unions in some countries. In Japan, China and India we
    operate with local business partners with the resulting risk of
    managing partner relationships to the business objectives. If
    our business model is not successful in a particular country, we
    may lose all or most of our investment in building and training
    the sales force in that country.

We are currently planning to expand our international operations
    in markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This
    may require considerable management time, as well as

start-up

expenses for market development before any significant revenues
    and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets
    may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in
    existing markets may be affected by local economic and market
    conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not
    achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations
    may be negatively impacted.

In recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been
    very challenging. In Argentina, we are principally engaged in
    the pension business. In December 2008, the Argentine government
    nationalized private pensions and seized the pension funds’
    investments, eliminating the private pensions business in
    Argentina. As a result, we will experience a reduction in the
    operation’s future revenues and cash flows. The Argentine
    government now controls all assets which previously were managed
    by our Argentine pension operations. Further governmental or
    legal actions related to our operations in Argentina could
    negatively impact our operations in Argentina and result in
    future losses.

See also “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May
    Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding the
    impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.

Reinsurance
    May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us
    Against Losses

As part of our overall risk management strategy, we purchase
    reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various
    business segments. See “Business — Reinsurance
    Activity.” While reinsurance agreements generally bind the
    reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally
    fixed pricing, market conditions beyond our control determine
    the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new
    business. In certain circumstances, the price of reinsurance for
    business already reinsured may also increase. Any decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any
    increase in the cost of reinsurance will, absent a decrease in
    the amount of reinsurance, reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we
    may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or
    may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable
    terms, which could adversely affect our ability to write future
    business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect
    to those policies we issue.



If the
    Counterparties to Our Reinsurance or Indemnification
    Arrangements or to the Derivative Instruments We Use to Hedge
    Our Business Risks Default or Fail to Perform, We May Be Exposed
    to Risks We Had Sought to Mitigate, Which Could Materially
    Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

We use reinsurance, indemnification and derivative instruments
    to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. In general,
    reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our
    policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us.
    Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers
    and indemnitors. We cannot provide assurance that our reinsurers
    will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that
    indemnitors will honor their obligations now or in the future or
    that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A
    reinsurer’s or indemnitor’s insolvency, inability or
    unwillingness to make payments under the terms of reinsurance
    agreements or indemnity agreements with us could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

In addition, we use derivative instruments to hedge various
    business risks. We enter into a variety of derivative
    instruments, including options, forwards, interest rate, credit
    default and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. See
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations —
    Investments.” If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor
    their obligations under these derivative instruments, our hedges
    of the related risk will be ineffective. This is a more
    pronounced risk to us in view of the recent stresses suffered by
    financial institutions. Such failure could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Our
    Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in
    Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our
    Growth

Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of
    insurance and other laws and regulations. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation.” State insurance laws regulate most aspects of
    our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance
    subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the
    states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they
    are licensed. Our

non-U.S. insurance

operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory
    authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and
    operate.

State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory
    authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among
    other things:

•

licensing companies and agents to transact business;

•

calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with
    statutory requirements;

•

mandating certain insurance benefits;

•

regulating certain premium rates;

•

reviewing and approving policy forms;

•

regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through
    the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices,
    distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;

•

regulating advertising;

•

protecting privacy;

•

establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and
    solvency standards;

•

fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and
    minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance
    policies and annuity contracts;

•

approving changes in control of insurance companies;

•

restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions
    between affiliates; and

•

regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.



State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess
    insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to
    help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
    policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an
    assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have
    currently established for these potential liabilities may not be
    adequate. See “Business — Regulation —
    Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and
    Similar Arrangements.”

State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine
    existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies
    and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in
    interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the
    consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered
    the need for regulations

and/or

laws
    to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of
    investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York
    and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation
    Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing Model Act which,
    if adopted by the states, would require disclosure by agents or
    brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents
    or brokers for the placement of insurance and documented
    acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer
    also compensates the agent or broker. Several states have
    enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment. We cannot predict
    how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative
    regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have a
    material adverse impact on our business.

Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly
    regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation
    and administrative policies in several areas can significantly
    and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include
    financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension
    regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In
    addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of
    insurance have been proposed. In view of recent events involving
    certain financial institutions and the financial markets, it is
    possible that the U.S. federal government will heighten its
    oversight of insurers such as us, including possibly through a
    federal system of insurance regulation

and/or

that
    the oversight responsibilities and mandates of existing or newly
    created regulatory bodies could change. We cannot predict
    whether these or other proposals will be adopted, or what
    impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could
    have on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations.

Our international operations are subject to regulation in the
    jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is
    similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of
    our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate
    in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that
    affect their operations also may affect our business
    relationships with them and their ability to purchase or
    distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. See “— Our International
    Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks
    that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our
    Profitability.”

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time
    consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and
    regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect
    compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations.

From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations
    or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries that could, if
    determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot
    predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that
    could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the
    interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and
    statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in
    areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.

We are also subject to other regulations, including banking
    regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional
    regulations. See “Business — Regulation.”



Litigation
    and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our
    Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and
    Harm to Our Reputation

We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating
    our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our
    pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings
    specific to us and others generally applicable to business
    practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection
    with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may
    bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits
    alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or
    underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product
    design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits
    and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers.
    Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may
    seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and
    treble damages, and the damages claimed and the amount of any
    probable and estimable liability, if any, may remain unknown for
    substantial periods of time. See “Legal Proceedings”
    and Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may be inherently impossible to ascertain with
    any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties can include how
    fact finders will view individually and in their totality
    documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness of
    witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, we review relevant information
    with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in
    our consolidated financial statements. The review includes
    senior legal and financial personnel. Unless stated elsewhere
    herein, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. See “Legal
    Proceedings” and Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Liabilities are established
    when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
    of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of matters noted in “Legal
    Proceedings” and Note 16 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that some of
    the matters could require us to pay damages or make other
    expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be
    estimated at December 31, 2008.

MLIC and MetLife, Inc. have been named as defendants in several
    lawsuits brought in connection with MLIC’s demutualization
    in 2000. Although most of these lawsuits have been dismissed,
    two have been certified as nationwide class action lawsuits.
    MLIC and its affiliates also are currently defendants in
    numerous lawsuits including class action lawsuits, alleging
    improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance
    policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.

In addition, MLIC is a defendant in a large number of lawsuits
    seeking compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries
    allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. These lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and have alleged that MLIC learned or should have
    learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among
    other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those
    health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters
    may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate
    its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable
    uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be
    dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data
    is limited and it is difficult to predict with any certainty the
    numerous variables that can affect liability estimates,
    including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve
    claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and
    future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a
    particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the
    jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of
    tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow
    plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure took
    place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known,
    and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their
    amounts. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought or the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year. Accordingly, it is
    reasonably possible that our total exposure to asbestos claims
    may be materially greater than



the liability recorded by us in our consolidated financial
    statements and that future charges to income may be necessary.
    The potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded.

We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as
    information requests, subpoenas and books and record
    examinations, from state and federal regulators and other
    authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant
    regulatory action against us could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the
    litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer
    significant reputational harm, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
    of operations, including our ability to attract new customers,
    retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees.
    Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the
    price of stocks of companies in our industry.

We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation,
    unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and
    other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition or results of
    operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated
    claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion,
    investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future,
    and we could become subject to further investigations and have
    lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In
    addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting
    investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions
    and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could
    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Changes
    in Accounting Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board or Other Standard-Setting Bodies May Adversely
    Affect Our Financial Statements

Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP,
    which is periodically revised

and/or

expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to
    adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized
    authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting
    Standards Board. Market conditions have prompted accounting
    standard setters to expose new guidance which further interprets
    or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to
    financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to
    issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of
    accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet
    implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on

Form 10-K

and

Form 10-Q.

An assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such
    proposals are subject to change through the exposure process
    and, therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot
    be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting
    standards we are required to adopt could change the current
    accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial
    statements and that such changes could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Further, the federal government, under the EESA, conducted an
    investigation of fair value accounting during the fourth quarter
    of 2008 and has granted the SEC the authority to suspend fair
    value accounting for any registrant or group of registrants at
    its discretion. The impact of such actions on registrants who
    apply fair value accounting cannot be readily determined at this
    time; however, actions taken by the federal government could
    have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and
    results of operations of companies, including ours, that apply
    fair value accounting.

Changes
    in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations May
    Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability

Federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to
    insurance products that are also “securities,”
    including variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
    policies. As a result, some of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries
    and their activities in offering and selling variable insurance
    contracts and policies are subject to extensive regulation under
    these securities laws. These subsidiaries issue variable annuity
    contracts and variable life insurance policies through separate
    accounts that are registered with the SEC as investment
    companies under the Investment Company Act. Each registered
    separate account is generally divided into sub-accounts, each of
    which invests in an underlying mutual fund which is itself a
    registered investment company under the Investment Company Act.
    In addition, the variable annuity contracts and variable life
    insurance policies issued by the separate accounts are
    registered with the SEC under the Securities Act. Other
    subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as



broker-dealers under the Exchange Act, and are members of, and
    subject to, regulation by FINRA. Further, some of our
    subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the SEC
    under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and are also
    registered as investment advisers in various states, as
    applicable.

Federal and state securities laws and regulations are primarily
    intended to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to
    protect investors in the securities markets, as well as protect
    investment advisory or brokerage clients. These laws and
    regulations generally grant regulatory agencies broad rulemaking
    and enforcement powers, including the power to limit or restrict
    the conduct of business for failure to comply with the
    securities laws and regulations. Changes to these laws or
    regulations that restrict the conduct of our business could have
    a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results
    of operations. In particular, changes in the regulations
    governing the registration and distribution of variable
    insurance products, such as changes in the regulatory standards
    for suitability of variable annuity contracts or variable life
    insurance policies, could have such a material adverse effect.

Changes
    in Tax Laws, Tax Regulations, or Interpretations of Such Laws or
    Regulations Could Increase Our Corporate Taxes; Changes in Tax
    Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to
    Consumers

Changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such
    laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes. Changes
    in corporate tax rates could affect the value of deferred tax
    assets and deferred tax liabilities. Furthermore, the value of
    deferred tax assets could be impacted by future earnings levels.

Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less
    attractive to consumers. A shift away from life insurance and
    annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products would reduce
    our income from sales of these products, as well as the assets
    upon which we earn investment income.

We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting
    corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted, what the
    specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether, if at
    all, any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our
    financial condition and results of operations.

We May
    Need to Fund Deficiencies in Our Closed Block; Assets
    Allocated to the Closed Block Benefit Only the Holders of Closed
    Block Policies

MLIC’s plan of reorganization, as amended (the
    “Plan”), required that we establish and operate an
    accounting mechanism, known as a closed block, to ensure that
    the reasonable dividend expectations of policyholders who own
    certain individual insurance policies of MLIC are met. See
    Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. We allocated assets to the closed block in an amount
    that will produce cash flows which, together with anticipated
    revenue from the policies included in the closed block, are
    reasonably expected to be sufficient to support obligations and
    liabilities relating to these policies, including, but not
    limited to, provisions for the payment of claims and certain
    expenses and tax, and to provide for the continuation of the
    policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999, if the
    experience underlying such scales continues, and for appropriate
    adjustments in such scales if the experience changes. We cannot
    provide assurance that the closed block assets, the cash flows
    generated by the closed block assets and the anticipated revenue
    from the policies included in the closed block will be
    sufficient to provide for the benefits guaranteed under these
    policies. If they are not sufficient, we must fund the
    shortfall. Even if they are sufficient, we may choose, for
    competitive reasons, to support policyholder dividend payments
    with our general account funds.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenue from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of those
    policies. In addition, to the extent that these amounts are
    greater than the amounts estimated at the time the closed block
    was funded, dividends payable in respect of the policies
    included in the closed block may be greater than they would be
    in the absence of a closed block. Any excess earnings will be
    available for distribution over time only to closed block
    policyholders.



The
    Continued Threat of Terrorism and Ongoing Military Actions May
    Adversely Affect the Level of Claim Losses We Incur and the
    Value of Our Investment Portfolio

The continued threat of terrorism, both within the United States
    and abroad, ongoing military and other actions and heightened
    security measures in response to these types of threats may
    cause significant volatility in global financial markets and
    result in loss of life, property damage, additional disruptions
    to commerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in
    our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines
    in the equity markets and reduced economic activity caused by
    the continued threat of terrorism. We cannot predict whether,
    and the extent to which, companies in which we maintain
    investments may suffer losses as a result of financial,
    commercial or economic disruptions, or how any such disruptions
    might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or
    principal on their securities. The continued threat of terrorism
    also could result in increased reinsurance prices and reduced
    insurance coverage and potentially cause us to retain more risk
    than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain
    reinsurance at lower prices. Terrorist actions also could
    disrupt our operations centers in the United States or abroad.
    In addition, the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in
    higher claims under our insurance policies than anticipated. See
    “— Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital
    Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely
    Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These
    Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future.”

The
    Occurrence of Events Unanticipated In Our Disaster Recovery
    Systems and Management Continuity Planning Could Impair Our
    Ability to Conduct Business Effectively

In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an
    epidemic, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus,
    a terrorist attack or war, unanticipated problems with our
    disaster recovery systems could have a material adverse impact
    on our ability to conduct business and on our results of
    operations and financial position, particularly if those
    problems affect our computer-based data processing,
    transmission, storage and retrieval systems and destroy valuable
    data. We depend heavily upon computer systems to provide
    reliable service. Despite our implementation of a variety of
    security measures, our computer systems could be subject to
    physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from
    unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a
    significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event
    of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could
    be severely compromised. These interruptions also may interfere
    with our suppliers’ ability to provide goods and services
    and our employees’ ability to perform their job
    responsibilities.

We
    Face Unforeseen Liabilities or Asset Impairments Arising from
    Possible Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses or
    Difficulties Integrating Such Businesses

We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses
    in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future.
    There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments,
    including goodwill impairments, that arise in connection with
    the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may
    acquire in the future. In addition, there may be liabilities or
    asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in
    the course of performing due diligence investigations on each
    business that we have acquired or may acquire. Furthermore, the
    use of our own funds as consideration in any acquisition would
    consume capital resources that would no longer be available for
    other corporate purposes.

Our ability to achieve certain benefits we anticipate from any
    acquisitions of businesses will depend in large part upon our
    ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an
    efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to integrate
    such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may
    take loner than expected. The integration of operations may
    require the dedication of significant management resources,
    which may distract management’s attention from day-to-day
    business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the
    operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to
    realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such
    acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be
    less than expected.



Guarantees
    Within Certain of Our Variable Annuity Guarantee Riders that
    Protect Policyholders Against Significant Downturns in Equity
    Markets May Increase the Volatility of Our Results Related to
    the Inclusion of an Own Credit Adjustment in the Estimated Fair
    Value of the Liability for These Riders

In determining the valuation of certain variable annuity
    guarantee rider liabilities that are carried at estimated fair
    value, we must consider our own credit standing, which is not
    hedged. A decrease in our own credit spread could cause the
    value of these liabilities to increase, resulting in a reduction
    to net income. An increase in our own credit spread could cause
    the value of these liabilities to decrease, resulting in an
    increase to net income. Because this credit adjustment is
    determined, at least in part, by taking into consideration
    publicly available information relating to our publicly-traded
    debt (including related credit default swap spreads), the
    overall condition of fixed income markets may impact this
    adjustment. The credit premium implied in our publicly-traded
    debt instruments may not always necessarily reflect our actual
    credit rating or our claims paying ability. Recently, the
    fixed-income markets have experienced a period of extreme
    volatility which negatively impacted market liquidity and
    increased credit spreads. The increase in credit default swap
    spreads has at times been even more pronounced than in the fixed
    income cash markets. In a broad based market downturn, this
    increase in our own credit spread could result in net income
    being relatively flat when a deterioration in other market
    inputs required for the estimate of fair value would otherwise
    result in a significant reduction in net income. The inclusion
    of our own credit standing in this case has the effect of muting
    the actual net income losses recognized. In subsequent periods,
    if our credit spreads improve relative to the overall market, we
    could have a reduction of net income in an overall improving
    market.

As a
    Holding Company, MetLife, Inc. Depends on the Ability of Its
    Subsidiaries to Transfer Funds to It to Meet Its Obligations and
    Pay Dividends

MetLife, Inc. is a holding company for its insurance and
    financial subsidiaries and does not have any significant
    operations of its own. Dividends from its subsidiaries and
    permitted payments to it under its tax sharing arrangements with
    its subsidiaries are its principal sources of cash to meet its
    obligations and to pay preferred and common dividends. If the
    cash MetLife, Inc. receives from its subsidiaries is
    insufficient for it to fund its debt service and other holding
    company obligations, MetLife, Inc. may be required to raise cash
    through the incurrence of debt, the issuance of additional
    equity or the sale of assets.

The payment of dividends and other distributions to MetLife,
    Inc. by its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance
    laws and regulations. In general, dividends in excess of
    prescribed limits require insurance regulatory approval. In
    addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of
    dividends or other payments by its insurance subsidiaries to
    MetLife, Inc. if they determine that the payment could be
    adverse to our policyholders or contractholders. See
    “Business — Regulation — Insurance
    Regulation” and Note 18 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity
    and Capital Sources — Dividends.”

Any payment of interest, dividends, distributions, loans or
    advances by our foreign subsidiaries to MetLife, Inc. could be
    subject to taxation or other restrictions on dividends or
    repatriation of earnings under applicable law, monetary transfer
    restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the
    jurisdiction in which such foreign subsidiaries operate. See
    “— Our International Operations Face Political,
    Legal, Operational and Other Risks That Could Negatively Affect
    Those Operations or Our Profitability.”

MetLife,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors May Control the Outcome of
    Stockholder Votes on Many Matters Due to the Voting Provisions
    of the MetLife Policyholder Trust

Under the Plan, we established the MetLife Policyholder Trust
    (the “Trust”) to hold the shares of MetLife, Inc.
    common stock allocated to eligible policyholders not receiving
    cash or policy credits under the plan. As of February 20,
    2009, 241,743,740 shares, or 29.6%, of the outstanding
    shares of MetLife, Inc. common stock, are held in the Trust.
    Because of the number of shares held in the Trust and the voting
    provisions of the Trust, the Trust may affect the outcome of
    matters brought to a stockholder vote.

Except on votes regarding certain fundamental corporate actions
    described below, the trustee will vote all of the shares of
    common stock held in the Trust in accordance with the
    recommendations given by MetLife, Inc.’s



Board of Directors to its stockholders or, if the board gives no
    such recommendations, as directed by the board. As a result of
    the voting provisions of the Trust, the Board of Directors may
    be able to control votes on matters submitted to a vote of
    stockholders, excluding those fundamental corporate actions, so
    long as the Trust holds a substantial number of shares of common
    stock.

If the vote relates to fundamental corporate actions specified
    in the Trust, the trustee will solicit instructions from the
    Trust beneficiaries and vote all shares held in the Trust in
    proportion to the instructions it receives. These actions
    include:

•

an election or removal of directors in which a stockholder has
    properly nominated one or more candidates in opposition to a
    nominee or nominees of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    or a vote on a stockholder’s proposal to oppose a board
    nominee for director, remove a director for cause or fill a
    vacancy caused by the removal of a director by stockholders,
    subject to certain conditions;

•

a merger or consolidation, a sale, lease or exchange of all or
    substantially all of the assets, or a recapitalization or
    dissolution, of MetLife, Inc., in each case requiring a vote of
    stockholders under applicable Delaware law;

•

any transaction that would result in an exchange or conversion
    of shares of common stock held by the Trust for cash, securities
    or other property; and

•

any proposal requiring MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors
    to amend or redeem the rights under the stockholder rights plan,
    other than a proposal with respect to which we have received
    advice of nationally-recognized legal counsel to the effect that
    the proposal is not a proper subject for stockholder action
    under Delaware law.

If a vote concerns any of these fundamental corporate actions,
    the trustee will vote all of the shares of common stock held by
    the Trust in proportion to the instructions it received, which
    will give disproportionate weight to the instructions actually
    given by Trust beneficiaries.

State
    Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws
    and Our Stockholder Rights Plan May Delay, Deter or Prevent
    Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might
    Consider in Their Best Interests

State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may
    delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders
    might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may
    prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium
    over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock
    offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence
    of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife,
    Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging
    takeover attempts in the future.

Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would
    face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or
    prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc.
    might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance
    laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife,
    Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or
    impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws
    prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance
    company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance
    regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is
    presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns,
    directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that
    insurance company or its parent company. We are also subject to
    banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to
    additional regulations. In addition, the Investment Company Act
    would require approval by the contract owners of our variable
    contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any
    affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our
    variable contracts. Finally, FINRA approval would be necessary
    for a change of control of any FINRA registered broker-dealer
    that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested
    stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations,
    including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional
    shares, for a period of three years following the time that the
    stockholder becomes an “interested



stockholder.” An “interested stockholder” is
    defined to include persons owning, directly or indirectly, 15%
    or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.

MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws
    also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a
    takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best
    interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include:
    classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into
    three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings
    by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of
    candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals
    to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority
    voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of
    the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.

The stockholder rights plan adopted by MetLife, Inc.’s
    Board of Directors may also have anti-takeover effects. The
    stockholder rights plan is designed to protect MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to
    acquire us and other coercive takeover tactics which, in the
    opinion of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors, could impair
    its ability to represent stockholder interests. The provisions
    of the stockholder rights plan may render an unsolicited
    takeover more difficult or less likely to occur or might prevent
    such a takeover, even though such takeover may offer MetLife,
    Inc.’s stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at
    a price above the prevailing market price and may be favored by
    a majority of MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders.

    Staff Comments

MetLife has no unresolved comments from the SEC staff regarding
    its periodic or current reports under the Exchange Act.

Properties

In December 2006, we signed a lease for 410,000 rentable
    square feet of which 100,000 rentable square feet are
    available for sublease in Manhattan, New York to be located on
    12 floors. The term of the lease commenced during 2008 and will
    continue for 21 years. We moved certain operations
    (including certain associates working in the Institutional,
    Individual and International segments, as well as
    Corporate & Other), from Long Island City,
    New York, to Manhattan in late 2008, but continue to
    maintain an on-going presence in Long Island City. Our lease in
    Long Island City, New York, covers 686,000 rentable square
    feet, under a long-term lease arrangement. In connection with
    the move of certain operations to Manhattan, in late 2008 we
    subleased 80,000 rentable square feet to two subtenants,
    each of which has met our standards of review with respect to
    creditworthiness. Additionally, 180,000 rentable square
    feet are available for sublease. As a result of this movement of
    operations, and current market conditions, the Company incurred
    a lease impairment charge of $38 million.

In November 2006, we sold our Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New York to a
    group led by Tishman Speyer and BlackRock Realty, the real
    estate arm of BlackRock, Inc., for $5.4 billion. The gain
    of $3.0 billion is included in income from discontinued
    operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

In connection with the 2005 sale of the 200 Park Avenue
    property, we have retained rights to existing signage and are
    leasing space for associates in the property for 20 years
    with optional renewal periods through 2205. Associates located
    in the 200 Park Avenue office, our headquarters, include those
    working in the Institutional and Individual segments.

We continue to own 15 other buildings in the United States that
    we use in the operation of our business. These buildings contain
    4.2 million rentable square feet and are located in the
    following states: Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, New
    Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.
    Our computer center in Rensselaer, New York is not owned in fee
    but rather is occupied pursuant to a long-term ground lease. We
    lease space in 797 other locations throughout the United States,
    and these leased facilities consist of 8.7 million rentable
    square feet. Approximately 66% of these leases are occupied as
    sales offices for the Individual segment, for MetLife Bank
    included within Corporate & Other, and the balance for
    our other business activities. We also own nine buildings
    outside the United States, comprising 300,000 rentable
    square feet including one building 192,000 square feet.
    condominium unit in Mexico that we use in the operation of our
    business. We lease 3.0 million rentable square



feet in various locations outside the United States. Management
    believes that these properties are suitable and adequate for our
    current and anticipated business operations.

We arrange for property and casualty coverage on our properties,
    taking into consideration our risk exposures and the cost and
    availability of commercial coverages, including deductible loss
    levels. In connection with the renewal of those coverages, we
    have arranged $700 million of property coverage including
    coverage for terrorism on our real estate portfolio through
    May 15, 2009, its renewal date.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. In 2007, the Company received $39 million upon
    the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the
    2000 acquisition of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”), and the Company reduced legal liabilities
    by $38 million after the settlement of certain cases. The
    review includes senior legal and financial personnel. Unless
    stated below, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are established when
    it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of the matters noted below; in 2007 the
    Company increased legal liabilities for pending sales practices,
    employment, property and casualty and intellectual property
    litigation matters against the Company. It is possible that some
    of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make
    other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could
    not be estimated at December 31, 2008.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of the Plan and the adequacy and accuracy of MLIC’s
    disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. The actions
    discussed below name as defendants some or all of MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. MLIC, the Holding
    Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (Sup.
    Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17, 2000).

The
    plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class action seek
    compensatory relief and punitive damages against MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. The court has
    certified a litigation class of present and former policyholders
    on plaintiffs’ claim that defendants violated
    section 7312 of the New York Insurance Law. Pursuant to the
    court’s order, plaintiffs have given notice to the class of
    the pendency of this action. Defendants’ motion for summary
    judgment is pending.



In re MetLife Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed
    April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against MLIC and the Holding Company, plaintiffs served a second
    consolidated amended complaint in 2004. Plaintiffs assert
    violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the Plan, claiming that
    the Policyholder Information Booklets failed to disclose certain
    material facts and contained certain material misstatements.
    They seek rescission and compensatory damages. By orders dated
    July 19, 2005 and August 29, 2006, the federal trial
    court certified a litigation class of present and former
    policyholders. The court has directed the manner and form of
    notice to the class, but plaintiffs have not yet distributed the
    notice. MLIC and the Holding Company have moved for summary
    judgment, and plaintiffs have moved for partial summary
    judgment. The court heard oral argument on the parties’
    motions for summary judgment on September 19, 2008.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury, and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups
    of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special
    relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture,
    produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly
    injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any
    actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries;
    (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers
    of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with
    respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the
    litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing
    claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied
    MLIC’s motions to dismiss. There can be no assurance that
    MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future.
    While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to
    continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos
    exposure, including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the
    year in connection with settlements made in that year and in
    prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’
    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.



In 2005, MLIC received approximately 18,500 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 100,250 claims, and paid
    approximately $74.3 million for settlements reached in 2005
    and prior years. In 2004, MLIC received approximately 23,900 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 108,000
    claims, and paid approximately $85.5 million for
    settlements reached in 2004 and prior years. In 2003, MLIC
    received approximately 58,750 new claims, ending the year with a
    total of approximately 111,700 claims, and paid approximately
    $84.2 million for settlements reached in 2003 and prior
    years. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the
    dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of
    any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provided for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion in excess of a
    $400 million self-insured retention. The Company’s
    initial option to commute the excess insurance policies for
    asbestos-related claims would have arisen at the end of 2008. On
    September 29, 2008, MLIC entered into agreements commuting
    the excess insurance policies as of September 30, 2008. As
    a result of the commutation of the policies, MLIC received cash
    and securities totaling $632 million. Of this total, MLIC
    received $115 million in fixed maturity securities on
    September 26, 2008, $200 million in cash on
    October 29, 2008, and $317 million in cash on
    January 29, 2009. MLIC recognized a loss on commutation of
    the policies in the amount of $35.3 million during 2008.

In the years prior to commutation, the excess insurance policies
    for asbestos-related claims were subject to annual and per claim
    sublimits. Amounts exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were approximately $16 million, $8 million and
    $0, respectively. Amounts were recoverable under the policies
    annually with respect to claims paid during the prior calendar
    year. Each asbestos-related policy contained an experience fund
    and a reference fund that provided for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund was greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund was less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund was tied to performance of the
    S&P 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
    A claim with respect to the prior year was made under the excess
    insurance policies in each year from 2003 through 2008 for the
    amounts paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of
    the retention. The foregone loss reimbursements were
    approximately $62.2 million with respect to claims for the
    period of 2002 through 2007. Because the policies were commuted
    as of September 30, 2008, there will be no claims under the
    policies or forgone loss reimbursements with respect to payments
    made in 2008 and thereafter.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law, and its
    past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    probable and reasonably estimable liability



for asbestos claims not yet asserted against MLIC, but which
    MLIC believes are reasonably probable of assertion; and
    (iii) the legal defense costs associated with the foregoing
    claims. Significant assumptions underlying MLIC’s analysis
    of the adequacy of its recorded liability with respect to
    asbestos litigation include: (i) the number of future
    claims; (ii) the cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the
    cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its
    exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its
    liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through
    December 31, 2008.

Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    seeking a broad range of information. The issues involved in
    information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. Certain
    regulators have requested information and documents regarding
    contingent commission payments to brokers, the Company’s
    awareness of any “sham” bids for business, bids and
    quotes that the Company submitted to potential customers,
    incentive agreements entered into with brokers, or compensation
    paid to intermediaries. Regulators also have requested
    information relating to market timing and late trading of mutual
    funds and variable insurance products and, generally, the
    marketing of products. The Company has received a subpoena from
    the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
    of California asking for documents regarding the insurance
    broker Universal Life Resources. The Company has been
    cooperating fully with these inquiries.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC; New
    England Mutual Life Insurance Company, New England Life
    Insurance Company and New England Securities Corporation
    (collectively “New England”); GALIC; Walnut Street
    Securities, Inc. (“Walnut Street Securities”) and
    MetLife Securities, Inc. (“MSI”). Over the past
    several years, these and a number of investigations by other
    regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and
    certain other relief. The Company may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner.

MSI is a defendant in two regulatory matters brought by the
    Illinois Department of Securities. In 2005, MSI received a
    notice from the Illinois Department of Securities asserting
    possible violations of the Illinois Securities Act in connection
    with sales of a former affiliate’s mutual funds. A response
    has been submitted and in January 2008, MSI received notice of
    the commencement of an administrative action by the Illinois
    Department of Securities. In May 2008, MSI’s motion to
    dismiss the action was denied. In the second matter, in December
    2008 MSI received a Notice of Hearing from the Illinois
    Department of Securities based upon a complaint alleging that
    MSI failed to reasonably supervise one of its former registered
    representatives in connection with the sale of variable
    annuities to Illinois investors. MSI intends to vigorously
    defend against the claims in these matters.

In June 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a
    Notice of Violation (“NOV”) regarding the operations
    of the Homer City Generating Station, an electrical generation
    facility. The NOV alleges, among other things, that the
    electrical generation facility is being operated in violation of
    certain federal and state Clean Air Act requirements. Homer City
    OL6 LLC, an entity owned by MLIC, is a passive investor with a
    minority interest in the electrical generation facility, which
    is solely operated by the lessee, EME Homer City Generation L.P.
    (“EME Homer”). Homer City OL6 LLC and EME Homer are
    among the respondents identified in the NOV. EME Homer has been
    notified of its obligation to indemnify Homer City OL6 LLC and
    MLIC for any claims resulting from the NOV and has expressly
    acknowledged its obligation to indemnify Homer City OL6 LLC.



Other
    Litigation

Jacynthe Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
    (Que. Super. Ct., filed March 1998).

This
    putative class action lawsuit involving sales practices claims
    is pending against MLIC in Canada. Plaintiff alleges
    misrepresentations regarding dividends and future payments for
    life insurance policies and seeks unspecified damages.

Travelers Ins. Co., et al. v. Banc of America Securities
    LLC (S.D.N.Y., filed December 13, 2001).

On
    January 6, 2009, after a jury trial

,

the district
    court entered a judgment in favor of The Travelers Insurance
    Company, now known as MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut,
    in the amount of approximately $42 million in connection
    with securities and common law claims against the defendant. The
    defendant has filed a post judgment motion seeking a judgment in
    its favor or, in the alternative, a new trial. If this motion is
    denied, the defendant will likely file an appeal. As it is
    possible that the judgment could be affected during the post
    judgment motion practice or upon appeal, and the Company has not
    collected any portion of the judgment, the Company has not
    recognized any award amount in its consolidated financial
    statements.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
    Company in Illinois. One suit claims breach of contract and
    fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical claims arising
    from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee pricing
    system. The second suit currently alleges breach of contract
    arising from the alleged use of preferred provider organizations
    to reduce medical provider fees covered by the medical claims
    portion of the insurance policy. Motions for class certification
    have been filed and briefed in both cases. A third putative
    nationwide class action relating to the payment of medical
    providers,

Innovative Physical Therapy, Inc. v. MetLife
    Auto & Home, et ano (D. N.J., filed November 12,
    2007),

was filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty
    Insurance Company in federal court in New Jersey. The court
    granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and plaintiff
    appealed the dismissal. The Company is vigorously defending
    against the claims in these matters.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife Inc., et
    al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19, 2003).

The
    American Dental Association and three individual providers have
    sued the Holding Company, MLIC and other non-affiliated
    insurance companies in a putative class action lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of

in-network

providers who allege that their claims are being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. On
    February 10, 2009, the district court granted the
    Company’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ second amended
    complaint, dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims except for
    breach of contract claims. Plaintiffs have been provided with an
    opportunity to re-plead the dismissed claims by
    February 26, 2009.

In Re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig. (D. N.J., filed
    February 24, 2005).

In this multi-district
    class action proceeding, plaintiffs’ complaint alleged that
    the Holding Company, MLIC, several non-affiliated insurance
    companies and several insurance brokers violated the Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”), and antitrust laws and committed other
    misconduct in the context of providing insurance to employee
    benefit plans and to persons who participate in such employee
    benefit plans. In August and September 2007 and January 2008,
    the court issued orders granting defendants’ motions to
    dismiss with prejudice the federal antitrust, the RICO, and the
    ERISA claims. In February 2008, the court dismissed the
    remaining state law claims on jurisdictional grounds.
    Plaintiffs’ appeal from the orders dismissing their RICO
    and federal antitrust claims is pending with the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A putative class action
    alleging that the Holding Company and other non-affiliated
    defendants violated state laws was transferred to the District
    of New Jersey but was not consolidated with other related
    actions. Plaintiffs’ motion to remand this action to state
    court in Florida is pending.

MetLife v. Park Avenue Securities, et. al. (FINRA
    Arbitration, filed May 2006).

MetLife commenced
    an action against Park Avenue Securities LLC., a registered
    investment adviser and broker-dealer that is an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance Company
    of America, alleging misappropriation of confidential and
    proprietary information and use of prohibited methods to solicit
    MetLife customers and recruit MetLife financial services
    representatives. On February 12, 2009, a Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority



(“FINRA”) arbitration panel awarded MetLife
    $21 million in damages, including punitive damages and
    attorneys fees. Park Avenue Securities may appeal the award.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007).

A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs assert legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs seek rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. In January and May 2008, the
    court issued orders granting the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss in part, dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims
    except for claims under the Investment Advisers Act.
    Defendants’ motion to dismiss claims under the Investment
    Advisers Act was denied. The Company will vigorously defend
    against the remaining claims in this matter.

Sales Practices Claims.

Over the past several
    years, MLIC, New England, GALIC, Walnut Street Securities and
    MSI have faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits,
    alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life
    insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.
    Some of the current cases seek substantial damages, including
    punitive and treble damages and attorneys’ fees. At
    December 31, 2008, there were approximately 125 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against the Company. The
    Company continues to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been
    made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable
    and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices claims
    against MLIC, New England, GALIC, MSI and Walnut Street
    Securities.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its
    activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor
    and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities
    and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries
    and conduct investigations concerning the Company’s
    compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and
    regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted
    previously in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

For purposes of this discussion, “MetLife” or the
    “Company” refers to MetLife, Inc., a Delaware
    corporation incorporated in 1999 (the “Holding
    Company”), and its subsidiaries, including Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). Following this
    summary is a discussion addressing the consolidated results of
    operations and financial condition of the Company for the
    periods indicated. This discussion should be read in conjunction
    with the forward-looking statement information included below,
    “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data”
    and the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    included elsewhere herein.

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations may contain or incorporate
    by reference information that includes or is based upon
    forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking
    statements give expectations or forecasts of future events.
    These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not
    relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words
    such as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe” and other words and terms
    of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future
    operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
    statements relating to future actions, prospective services or
    products, future performance or results of current and
    anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the
    outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in
    operations and financial results.

Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.
    They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be
    important in determining MetLife’s actual future results.
    These statements are based on current expectations and the
    current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and
    uncertainties that are difficult to predict. These statements
    are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could
    differ materially from those expressed or implied in the
    forward-looking statements. Risks, uncertainties, and other
    factors that might cause such differences include the risks,
    uncertainties and other factors identified in MetLife,
    Inc.’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”). These factors include:
    (i) difficult and adverse conditions in the global and
    domestic capital and credit markets; (ii) continued
    volatility and further deterioration of the capital and credit
    markets, which may affect the Company’s ability to seek
    financing or access its credit facilities;
    (iii) uncertainty about the effectiveness of the
    U.S. government’s plan to stabilize the financial
    system by injecting capital into financial institutions,
    purchasing large amounts of illiquid, mortgage-backed and other
    securities from financial institutions, or otherwise;
    (iv) the impairment of other financial institutions;
    (v) potential liquidity and other risks resulting from
    MetLife’s participation in a securities lending program and
    other transactions; (vi) exposure to financial and capital
    market risk; (vii) changes in general economic conditions,
    including the performance of financial markets and interest
    rates, which may affect the Company’s ability to raise
    capital, generate fee income and market-related revenue and
    finance statutory reserve requirements and may require the
    Company to pledge collateral or make payments related to
    declines in value of specified assets; (viii) defaults on
    the Company’s mortgage and consumer loans;
    (ix) investment losses and defaults, and changes to
    investment valuations; (x) impairments of goodwill and
    realized losses or market value impairments to illiquid assets;
    (xi) unanticipated changes in industry trends;
    (xii) heightened competition, including with respect to
    pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of
    distributors, the development of new products by new and
    existing competitors and for personnel;
    (xiii) discrepancies between actual claims experience and
    assumptions used in setting prices for the Company’s
    products and establishing the liabilities for the Company’s
    obligations for future policy benefits and claims;
    (xiv) discrepancies between actual experience and
    assumptions used in establishing liabilities related to other
    contingencies or obligations; (xv) ineffectiveness of risk
    management policies and procedures, including with respect to
    guaranteed benefit riders (which may be affected by fair value
    adjustments arising from changes in our



own credit spread) on certain of the Company’s variable
    annuity products; (xvi) increased expenses relating to
    pension and post-retirement benefit plans,
    (xvii) catastrophe losses; (xviii) changes in
    assumptions related to deferred policy acquisition costs
    (“DAC”), value of business acquired (“VOBA”)
    or goodwill; (xix) downgrades in MetLife, Inc.’s and
    its affiliates’ claims paying ability, financial strength
    or credit ratings; (xx) economic, political, currency and
    other risks relating to the Company’s international
    operations; (xx) availability and effectiveness of
    reinsurance or indemnification arrangements,
    (xxi) regulatory, legislative or tax changes that may
    affect the cost of, or demand for, the Company’s products
    or services; (xxii) changes in accounting standards,
    practices

and/or

policies; (xxiii) adverse results or other consequences
    from litigation, arbitration or regulatory investigations;
    (xxiv) deterioration in the experience of the “closed
    block” established in connection with the reorganization of
    MLIC; (xxv) the effects of business disruption or economic
    contraction due to terrorism, other hostilities, or natural
    catastrophes; (xxvi) MetLife’s ability to identify and
    consummate on successful terms any future acquisitions, and to
    successfully integrate acquired businesses with minimal
    disruption; (xxvii) MetLife, Inc.’s primary reliance,
    as a holding company, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet
    debt payment obligations and the applicable regulatory
    restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay such
    dividends; and (xxviii) other risks and uncertainties
    described from time to time in MetLife, Inc.’s filings with
    the SEC.

MetLife, Inc. does not undertake any obligation to publicly
    correct or update any forward-looking statement if MetLife, Inc.
    later becomes aware that such statement is not likely to be
    achieved. Please consult any further disclosures MetLife, Inc.
    makes on related subjects in reports to the SEC.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

The Company reported $3,084 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and net income per diluted common share
    of $4.14 for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $4,180 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and net income per diluted common share of $5.48
    for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income available
    to common shareholders decreased by $1,096 million, or 26%,
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior
    year.

The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was
    principally due to an increase in losses from discontinued
    operations of $516 million. This was primarily the result
    of the split-off of substantially all of the Company’s
    interest in RGA in September 2008 whereby stockholders of the
    Company were offered the opportunity to exchange their shares of
    MetLife, Inc. common stock for shares of RGA Class B common
    stock based upon a pre-determined exchange ratio.

The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was
    also driven by an increase in other expenses of
    $972 million, net of income tax. The increase in other
    expenses was due to:

•

Higher DAC amortization in the Individual segment related to
    lower expected future gross profits due to separate account
    balance decreases resulting from recent market declines, higher
    net investment gains primarily due to net derivative gains and
    the reduction on expected cumulative earnings of the closed
    block partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings of the
    closed block and changes in assumptions used to estimate future
    gross profits and margins. In addition, there is further offset
    in the Institutional segment due to a charge associated with the
    adoption of

SOP 05-1

in the prior year.

•

An increase in corporate expenses primarily related to an
    enterprise-wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement
    initiative. As a result of a strategic review begun in 2007, the
    Company launched an enterprise



initiative called Operational Excellence. This initiative began
    in April 2008 and management expects the initiative to be fully
    implemented by December 31, 2010. This initiative is
    focused on reducing complexity, leveraging scale, increasing
    productivity, improving the effectiveness of the Company’s
    operations and providing a foundation for future growth. The
    Company recognized within Corporate & Other during the
    current period an initial accrual for post-employment related
    expenses.

•

Higher legal costs in Corporate & Other principally
    driven by costs associated with the commutation of three
    asbestos insurance policies and higher expenses in the
    Institutional and International segments as well as
    Corporate & Other associated with business growth and
    higher corporate support expenses.

•

Higher expenses in Corporate & Other relating to
    increased compensation, rent, and mortgage loan origination
    costs and servicing expenses associated with two acquisitions by
    MetLife Bank in 2008.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $2,085 million, net of income tax, across all of the
    Company’s operating segments but most notably within the
    Institutional and International segments due to business growth.
    Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends
    increased commensurately by $2,393 million, net of income
    tax; however, policyholder benefits and claims were also
    adversely impacted by an increase in catastrophe losses in the
    Auto & Home segment, a charge within the Institutional
    segment resulting from a liability adjustment in the group
    annuity business, and business growth.

Net investment losses decreased by $1,554 million, net of
    income tax, to a gain of $1,178 million, net of income tax,
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from a loss of
    $376 million, net of income tax, for the comparable 2007
    period. The decrease in net investment losses is due to an
    increase in gains on derivatives partially offset by losses
    primarily on fixed maturity and equity securities. Derivative
    gains were driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were
    partially offset by losses on embedded derivatives primarily
    associated with variable annuity riders. Gains on freestanding
    derivatives increased by $4,225 million, net of income tax,
    and were primarily driven by: i) gains on certain interest
    rate swaps, floors and swaptions which were economic hedges of
    certain investment assets and liabilities, ii) gains from
    foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the
    U.S. dollar strengthening as well as, iii) gains
    primarily from equity options, financial futures, and interest
    rate swaps hedging the embedded derivatives. The gains on these
    equity options, financial futures, and interest rate swaps
    substantially offset the change in the underlying embedded
    derivative liability that is hedged by these derivatives. Losses
    on the embedded derivatives increased by $1,514 million,
    net of income tax, and were driven by declining interest rates
    and poor equity market performance throughout the year. These
    embedded derivative losses include a $1,946 million, net of
    income tax, gain resulting from the effect of the widening of
    the Company’s own credit spread which is required to be
    used in the valuation of these variable annuity rider embedded
    derivatives under SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value
    Measurements

(“SFAS 157”), which became
    effective January 1, 2008. The remaining change in net
    investment losses of $1,157 million, net of income tax, is
    principally attributable to an increase in losses on fixed
    maturity and equity securities, and, to a lesser degree, an
    increase in losses on mortgage and consumer loans and other
    limited partnerships offset by an increase in foreign currency
    transaction gains. The increase in losses on fixed maturity and
    equity securities is primarily attributable to an increase in
    impairments associated with financial services industry holdings
    which experienced losses as a result of bankruptcies, FDIC
    receivership, and Federal government assisted capital infusion
    transactions in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. Losses on
    fixed maturity and equity securities were also driven by an
    increase in credit related impairments on communication and
    consumer sector security holdings, losses on asset-backed
    securities as well as an increase in losses on fixed maturity
    security holdings where the Company either lacked the intent to
    hold, or due to extensive credit widening, the Company was
    uncertain of its intent to hold these fixed maturity securities
    for a period of time sufficient to allow recovery of the market
    value decline.

Net investment income decreased by $1,149 million, or 10%,
    net of income tax, to $10,592 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 from $11,741 million for the
    comparable 2007 period. Management attributes
    $2,042 million, net of income tax, of this change to a
    decrease in yields, partially offset by an increase of
    $893 million due to growth in average invested assets.
    Average invested assets are calculated on a cost basis without
    unrealized gains and losses. The decrease in net investment
    income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower
    returns on other limited partnership interests, real estate
    joint ventures, short-term investments, fixed maturity
    securities, and mortgage loans, partially offset by improved
    securities lending results. Management anticipates that



the significant volatility in the equity, real estate and credit
    markets will continue in 2009 which could continue to impact net
    investment income and yields on other limited partnerships and
    real estate joint ventures. Net investment income increased due
    to an increase in average invested assets, on an amortized cost
    basis, primarily within short-term investments, other invested
    assets including derivatives, mortgage loans, other limited
    partnership interests, and real estate joint ventures.

A decrease in interest credited to policyholder account balances
    of $438 million, net of income tax, resulted from a decline
    in average crediting rates, which was largely due to the impact
    of lower short-term interest rates in the current period, offset
    by an increase from growth in the average policyholder account
    balance, primarily the result of continued growth in the global
    GIC and funding agreement products all of which occurred within
    the Institutional segment. There was also a decrease in interest
    credited in the International segment as a result of a reduction
    in unit-linked policyholder liabilities reflecting the losses of
    the trading portfolio backing these liabilities.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

The Company reported $4,180 million in net income available
    to common shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of
    $5.48 for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
    $6,159 million in net income available to common
    shareholders and earnings per diluted common share of $7.99 for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. Net income available to
    common shareholders decreased by $1,979 million, or 32%,
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the 2006
    period.

The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was
    primarily due to a decrease in income from discontinued
    operations of $3,168 million, net of income tax. This
    decrease in income from discontinued operations was principally
    driven by a gain on the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties in Manhattan, New York, that was
    recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006. Also
    contributing to the decrease was lower net investment income and
    net investment gains (losses) from discontinued operations
    related to real estate properties sold or held-for-sale during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year
    ended December 31, 2006. Lower income from discontinued
    operations related to the sale of MetLife Insurance Limited
    (“MetLife Australia”) annuities and pension businesses
    to a third party in the third quarter of 2007 and lower income
    from discontinued operations related to the sale of SSRM
    Holdings, Inc. (“SSRM”) resulting from a
    reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year
    December 31, 2006. This decrease was partially offset by
    higher income from discontinued operations related to RGA, which
    was reclassified to discontinued operations in the third quarter
    of 2008 as a result of a tax-free split-off. RGA’s income
    was higher in 2007, primarily due to an increase in premiums,
    net of an increase in policyholder benefits and claims, due to
    additional in-force business from facultative and automatic
    treaties and renewal premiums on existing blocks of business
    combined with an increase in net investment income, net of
    interest credited to policyholder account balances, due to
    higher invested assets. These increases in RGA’s income
    were offset by an increase in net investment losses resulting
    from a decline in the estimated fair value of embedded
    derivatives associated with the reinsurance of annuity products
    on a funds withheld basis.

The decrease in net income available to common shareholders was
    also driven by an increase in other expenses of
    $580 million, net of income tax. The increase in other
    expenses was primarily due to higher amortization of deferred
    policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) resulting from
    business growth, lower net investment losses in the current year
    and the net impact of revisions to management’s assumption
    used to determine estimated gross profits and margins in both
    years. In addition, other expenses increased due to higher
    compensation, higher interest expense on debt and interest on
    tax contingencies, the net impact of revisions to certain
    liabilities in both periods, asset write-offs, higher general
    spending and expenses related to growth initiatives, partially
    offset by lower legal costs and integration costs incurred in
    2006.

The net effect of increases in premiums, fees and other revenues
    of $1,046 million, net of income tax, across all of the
    Company’s operating segments and increases in policyholder
    benefit and claims and policyholder dividends of
    $610 million, net of income tax, was attributable to
    overall business growth and increased net income available to
    common shareholders.



Net investment income increased by $1,180 million, net of
    income tax, or 11%, to $11,741 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 from $10,561 million for the
    comparable 2006 period. Management attributes $700 million
    of this increase to growth in the average asset base and
    $480 million to an increase in yields. Growth in the
    average asset base was primarily within fixed maturity
    securities, mortgage loans, real estate joint ventures and other
    limited partnership interests. Higher yields was primarily due
    to higher returns on fixed maturity securities, other limited
    partnership interests excluding hedge funds, equity securities
    and improved securities lending results, partially offset by
    lower returns on real estate joint ventures, cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments, hedge funds and mortgage
    loans.

Net investment losses decreased by $522 million to a loss
    of $376 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from a loss of $898 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    The decrease in net investment losses was primarily due to a
    reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting
    principally from the 2006 portfolio repositioning in a rising
    interest rate environment, increased gains from asset-based
    foreign currency transactions due to a decline in the
    U.S. dollar year over year against several major currencies
    and increased gains on equity securities, partially offset by
    increased losses from the mark-to-market on derivatives and
    reduced gains on real estate and real estate joint ventures.

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances associated with an increase in the average policyholder
    account balance decreased net income available to common
    shareholders by $365 million, net of income tax.

The remainder of the variance is due to the change in effective
    tax rates between periods.

Consolidated
    Company Outlook

The marketplace is still reacting and adapting to the unusual
    economic events that took place over the past year and
    management expects the volatility in the financial markets to
    continue in 2009. As a result, management expects a modest
    increase, on a constant exchange rate basis, in premiums, fees
    and other revenues in 2009, with mixed results across the
    various businesses. While the Company continues to gain market
    share in a number of product lines, premiums, fees and other
    revenues have and may continue to be impacted by the
    U.S. and global recession, which may be reflected by, but
    is not limited to:

•

Lower fee income from separate account businesses, including
    variable annuity and life products in Individual Business.

•

A potential reduction in payroll linked revenue from
    Institutional group insurance customers.

•

A decline in demand for certain International and Institutional
    retirement & savings products.

•

A decrease in Auto & Home premiums resulting from a
    depressed housing market and auto industry.

With the expectation of the turbulent financial markets
    continuing in 2009, management expects continued downward
    pressure on net income, specifically net investment income, as
    management expects lower returns from other limited
    partnerships, real estate joint ventures, and securities
    lending. In addition, the resulting impact of the financial
    markets on net investment gains (losses) and unrealized
    investment gains (losses) can and will vary greatly and
    therefore, it is difficult to predict. Also difficult to
    determine is the impact of own credit, as it varies
    significantly and this exposure is not hedged.

Certain insurance-related liabilities, specifically those
    associated with guarantees, are tied to market performance,
    which in times of depressed investment markets may require
    management to establish additional liabilities. However, many of
    the risks associated with these guarantees are hedged. The
    turbulent financial markets, sustained over a period of time,
    may also necessitate management to strengthen insurance
    liabilities that are not associated with guarantees. Management
    does not anticipate significant changes in the underlying trends
    that drive underwriting results, with the possible exception of
    certain trends in the Auto & Home and disability
    businesses.

Certain expenses may increase due to initiatives such as
    Operational Excellence. Other charges are also possible as the
    combination of the downward pressure on net income coupled with
    the expectations of the financial markets, may necessitate a
    review of goodwill impairment, specifically within the
    Individual Business. The unusual



financial market conditions will also likely cause an increase
    in the Company’s pension-related expense and may cause an
    increase in DAC amortization.

In response to the challenges presented by the unusual economic
    environment, management continues to focus on disciplined
    underwriting, pricing, hedging strategies, as well as focused
    expense management.

Institutional
    Business Outlook

Management expects continued growth in premium, fees, and other
    revenues across the majority of the Institutional businesses.
    Revenues in many of the businesses can fluctuate based, in part,
    on the covered payroll of customers or changes in the amount of
    coverage they have purchased for current or former employees. As
    a result, in periods of high unemployment, revenue may be
    impacted. Revenue may also be negatively impacted as a result of
    customers’ reduction of coverage stemming from benefit plan
    changes, the elimination of retiree coverage or customer-related
    bankruptcies. Revenues in the retirement & savings
    business may experience some pressure as the demand for certain
    of these products can decline during periods of volatile credit
    and investment markets.

With the expectation of the turbulent financial markets
    continuing in 2009, management expects to see lower earnings
    resulting from depressed levels of net investment income,
    specifically as previously discussed in the consolidated
    outlook, which will put downward pressure on earnings from
    interest margins in the spread-related businesses. If there is
    an extended period of sustained, low long-term market interest
    rates, it is possible that strengthening certain long-term
    liabilities could be necessary. Management does not expect to
    see significant changes in the underlying trends that drive
    underwriting results, with the possible exception of the
    disability business. Management thinks the level of disability
    claims is correlated to the unemployment rate and therefore
    underwriting results in this business may be impacted if the
    recession continues to deepen and there is a continued rise in
    the unemployment rate.

In 2009, management will continue to focus on disciplined
    underwriting, pricing and aggressively managing expenses, while
    making deliberate investments in certain areas that Management
    expects will create long-term growth opportunities. The unusual
    financial market conditions previously mentioned, will also
    likely cause an increase in the Company’s pension-related
    expense.

Individual
    Business Outlook

Management expects 2009 premium, fees and other revenues to be
    down slightly compared to 2008 results. Individual Business
    experienced a significant decline in asset-based fees in annuity
    and variable life products in the second half of 2008 due to
    equity market declines. This depressed level of fee revenue is
    expected to continue in 2009. However, Individual Business
    experienced a significant increase in fourth quarter 2008 fixed
    annuity sales, which management believes was partially the
    result of consumers recognizing the strength of MetLife’s
    guarantees. While management believes fixed annuity sales will
    continue to be strong, future sales of all products could be
    impacted as the financial services industry adjusts to the
    economic environment and as anticipated industry consolidation
    occurs.

Management believes the investment and capital markets may
    continue to be turbulent in 2009, which would continue to exert
    downward pressure on net income, specifically net investment
    income as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook.

Certain annuity and life benefit guarantees are tied to market
    performance, which in times of depressed investment markets, may
    require management to establish additional liabilities. However,
    many of the risks associated with these guarantees are hedged.
    These pressures might result in potential modifications to
    product pricing strategies associated with acceptable returns
    for the underlying risks being covered.

Other charges are also possible as the combination of the
    downward pressure on net income coupled with the expectations of
    the financial markets, may necessitate a review of goodwill
    impairment. The unusual financial market conditions will also
    likely cause an increase in the Company’s pension-related
    expense and may cause an increase in DAC amortization.



Management believes that its disciplined approach to
    underwriting, pricing, hedging and investment strategies will
    further strengthen MetLife’s industry leadership position
    and mitigate the impacts from the ongoing uncertainty in the
    investment markets. Additionally, Management continues to focus
    on expense management by driving efficiency and productivity
    gains within the distribution and home office organizations.

International
    Business Outlook

Although management expects that premiums, fees and other
    revenues, on a constant exchange rate basis, will continue to
    increase across the regions in 2009, there is a risk of lower
    product demand as well as higher policy surrenders if the trend
    of higher unemployment, decreased individual income levels, and
    lower corporate earnings continues in 2009. To address this,
    various distribution channels and customer service operations
    initiatives are being implemented to expand relationships with
    existing distributors, develop new channel outlets and improve
    persistency management. In addition, market conditions have and
    may continue to cause an increase in the cost of related hedging
    programs and may result in a decrease in fee income from lower
    assets under management. Furthermore, the responses of
    governments and policymakers, in the countries in which the
    business operates, to the economic circumstances could have an
    unpredictable impact on results. Continued volatility in foreign
    currency exchange rates may adversely impact reported premiums,
    fees and other revenues as well as net income. Management
    continues to evaluate strategies to mitigate this risk.

Management expects continued turbulence in global capital
    markets during 2009, which may create downward pressure on net
    income, specifically net investment income as previously
    discussed in the consolidated outlook.

In the Asia region, certain annuity benefit guarantees are tied
    to market performance, which in times of depressed investment
    markets, may require management to establish additional
    liabilities. This exposure may result in modifications to our
    product pricing strategies in order to maintain acceptable
    returns for the underwriting risks being covered. The
    sufficiency of certain reserves in the Asia region is sensitive
    to interest rates and other related assumptions. Adverse changes
    in key assumptions for interest rates, exchange rates, mortality
    and morbidity levels or lapse rates could lead to a need to
    strengthen reserves.

Management continues to take a disciplined approach toward
    expense management, however, management will continue to invest
    in infrastructure and distribution improvements where such
    spending will enhance growth. The unusual financial market
    conditions may cause an increase in DAC amortization. Management
    believes that the ability to deliver quality risk &
    protection and retirement & savings products to the
    markets, coupled with the Company’s financial strength and
    strong risk management expertise, will help achieve continued
    growth in this challenging environment.

Management continues to take a disciplined approach toward
    expense management. Operational excellence initiatives
    undertaken by management in 2008 and planned for 2009 will
    create expense efficiencies, however, management will continue
    to invest in infrastructure and distribution improvements where
    such spending will enhance growth. Management believes that the
    ability to deliver quality risk & protection and
    retirement & savings products to the markets, coupled
    with the Company’s financial strength and strong risk
    management expertise, will help achieve continued growth in this
    challenging environment.

Auto &
    Home Outlook

Management expects premiums for the Auto & Home segment to
    grow slightly in 2009. The key sales triggers of new and
    existing home sales and auto sales dropped precipitously during
    2008, contributing to large declines in new Homeowner and Auto
    policies written during 2008. However, these declines began to
    slow late in 2008. New business sales are expected to rebound
    modestly for both Auto and Homeowners, assuming overall economic
    conditions improve, particularly as credit availability returns,
    and as a combination of various marketing and sales initiatives
    have been implemented. Retention ratios are expected to remain
    flat, or improve slightly, as specific underwriting initiatives
    to control exposures to catastrophe events were completed in the
    fourth quarter of 2008. Net premiums written for 2009 are
    expected to increase modestly with slightly larger increases in
    Auto premiums written and slightly smaller increases in
    Homeowners and other. A portion of this increase is expected to
    result from increases in exposures with the remaining change
    coming from increased average premium per policy.



Net investment income is also expected to be slightly lower in
    2009, as previously discussed in the consolidated outlook, and
    cash from operations and maturing investments is reinvested at
    slightly lower rates. In addition, Management expects the
    expense ratio to decline slightly as Management continues to
    manage operating expenses.

Underwriting margins for both Auto and Homeowners are expected
    to remain under pressure as some carriers have been willing to
    accept higher combined ratios in an attempt to grow written
    premium. Auto results benefited primarily from lower severities
    during 2008. A reduction in miles driven, initially tied to
    higher gasoline prices and later in the year to the general
    economic slowdown, contributed to these improvements. A
    continuation of the trend towards lower frequencies is expected
    for 2009 with higher severities expected to more than offset the
    gains from frequencies. Management believes this will result in
    a slightly higher loss and loss adjusting expense ratio for
    2009, compared to the same ratio for 2008, excluding prior year
    loss development. Homeowner margins for 2008, excluding
    catastrophes, were impacted by higher claims frequencies,
    primarily related to greater non-catastrophe weather-related
    losses, offset by lower severities. In 2009, a return to more
    normal weather patterns is expected and management believes will
    result in lower frequencies in 2009 partially offset by higher
    severities, resulting in a small expected drop in the Homeowner
    loss and loss adjusting ratio, excluding catastrophes, as
    compared to 2008. The unusual financial market conditions,
    previously discussed, will also likely cause an increase in the
    Company’s pension-related expense. Management continues to
    aggressively look for ways to control costs in all other areas
    so it may maintain an appropriate expense ratio.

Corporate &
    Other Outlook

Management believes the investment and capital markets may
    continue to be turbulent in 2009, which would continue to exert
    downward pressure on net investment income, as previously
    discussed in the consolidated outlook, and earnings on excess
    surplus equity. Management expects that investment income could
    be adversely impacted by a continuation of increased liquidity
    levels due to the uncertain operating environment and lack of
    suitable investment opportunities Current liquidity levels may
    position us to take advantage of any economic recovery,
    mitigating the impact that these levels have on net investment
    income.

Management does not expect a significant increase in interest
    expense. A portion of the Company’s debt has a variable
    interest rate and the associated interest expense will fluctuate
    with market rates. However, this expense has a corresponding
    investment that is also tied to variable rates and therefore,
    generally should minimize the impact to net income. In addition,
    settlements for asbestos claims and other potential legal claims
    may have an adverse impact on net income.

Management expects that the MetLife Bank acquisitions completed
    in 2008 will be accretive to 2009 earnings with additional
    investment income and higher premiums, fees, and other income,
    partially offset with increased interest and operating expenses.
    MetLife Bank could be impacted by changes in the residential
    loan market.

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Disposition
    of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated

On September 12, 2008, the Company completed a tax-free
    split-off of its majority-owned subsidiary, RGA. The Company and
    RGA entered into a recapitalization and distribution agreement,
    pursuant to which the Company agreed to divest substantially all
    of its 52% interest in RGA to the Company’s stockholders.
    The split-off was effected through the following:

•

A recapitalization of RGA common stock into two classes of
    common stock — RGA Class A common stock and RGA
    Class B common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
    recapitalization, each outstanding share of RGA common stock,
    including the 32,243,539 shares of RGA common stock
    beneficially owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, was
    reclassified as one share of RGA Class A common stock.
    Immediately thereafter, the Company and its subsidiaries
    exchanged 29,243,539 shares of its RGA Class A common
    stock — which represented all of the RGA Class A
    common stock beneficially owned by the Company and its
    subsidiaries other than 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock — with RGA for
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock.



•

An exchange offer, pursuant to which the Company offered to
    acquire MetLife common stock from its stockholders in exchange
    for all of its 29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common
    stock. The exchange ratio was determined based upon a
    ratio — as more specifically described in the exchange
    offering document — of the value of the MetLife and
    RGA shares during the

three-day

period prior to the closing of the exchange offer. The
    3,000,000 shares of the RGA Class A common stock were
    not subject to the tax-free exchange.

As a result of completion of the recapitalization and exchange
    offer, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA’s Class B common stock
    with a net book value of $1,716 million. The resulting loss
    on disposition, inclusive of transaction costs of
    $60 million, was $458 million. The
    3,000,000 shares of RGA Class A common stock retained
    by the Company are marketable equity securities which do not
    constitute significant continuing involvement in the operations
    of RGA; accordingly, they have been classified within equity
    securities in the consolidated financial statements of the
    Company at a cost basis of $157 million which is equivalent
    to the net book value of the shares. The cost basis will be
    adjusted to estimated fair value at each subsequent reporting
    date. The Company has agreed to dispose of the remaining shares
    of RGA within the next five years. In connection with the
    Company’s agreement to dispose of the remaining shares, the
    Company also recognized, in its provision for income tax on
    continuing operations, a deferred tax liability of
    $16 million which represents the difference between the
    book and taxable basis of the remaining investment in RGA.

The impact of the disposition of the Company’s investment
    in RGA is reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements as discontinued operations. The disposition of RGA
    results in the elimination of the Company’s Reinsurance
    segment. The Reinsurance segment was comprised of the results of
    RGA, which at disposition became discontinued operations of
    Corporate & Other, and the interest on economic
    capital, which has been reclassified to the continuing
    operations of Corporate & Other.

Disposition
    of Texas Life Insurance Company

MetLife, Inc. has entered into an agreement to sell Cova
    Corporation, the parent company of Texas Life Insurance Company
    in early 2009. As a result of the sale agreement, the Company
    recognized gains from discontinued operations of
    $37 million, net of income tax, in the fourth quarter of
    2008. The gain was comprised of recognition of tax benefits of
    $65 million relating to the excess of outside tax basis of
    Cova over its financial reporting basis offset by other than
    temporary impairments of $28 million, net of income tax,
    relating to Cova’s investments. The Company has
    reclassified the assets and liabilities of Cova as held-for-sale
    and its operations into discontinued operations for all periods
    presented in the consolidated financial statements.

    Acquisitions

During 2008, the Company made five acquisitions for
    $783 million. As a result of these acquisitions,
    MetLife’s Institutional segment increased its product
    offering of dental and vision benefit plans, MetLife Bank within
    Corporate & Other entered the mortgage origination and
    servicing business and the International segment increased its
    presence in Mexico and Brazil. The acquisitions were each
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
    accordingly, commenced being included in the operating results
    of the Company upon their respective closing dates. Total
    consideration paid by the Company for these acquisitions
    consisted of $763 million in cash and $20 million in
    transaction costs. The net fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed totaled $527 million, resulting in
    goodwill of $256 million. Goodwill increased by
    $122 million, $73 million and $61 million in the
    International segment, Institutional segment and
    Corporate & Other, respectively. The goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes. Value of customer relationships
    acquired (“VOCRA”), VOBA and other intangibles
    increased by $137 million, $7 million and
    $6 million, respectively, as a result of these acquisitions.

Other
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

On June 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in a joint venture in Hong Kong, MetLife Fubon Limited
    (“MetLife Fubon”), for $56 million in cash,
    resulting in MetLife Fubon becoming a consolidated subsidiary of
    the Company. The transaction was treated as a step acquisition,
    and at June 30, 2007, total assets and liabilities of
    MetLife Fubon of $839 million and $735 million,
    respectively, were included in the Company’s



consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s investment for
    the initial 50% interest in MetLife Fubon was $48 million.
    The Company used the equity method of accounting for such
    investment in MetLife Fubon. The Company’s share of the
    joint venture’s results for the six months ended
    June 30, 2007, was a loss of $3 million. The fair
    value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the
    step acquisition at June 30, 2007, was $427 million
    and $371 million, respectively. No additional goodwill was
    recorded as a part of the step acquisition. As a result of this
    acquisition, additional VOBA and VODA of $45 million and
    $5 million, respectively, were recorded and both have a
    weighted average amortization period of 16 years. In June
    2008, the Company revised the valuation of certain long-term
    liabilities, VOBA, and VODA based on new information received.
    As a result, the fair value of acquired insurance liabilities
    and VOBA were reduced by $5 million and $12 million,
    respectively, offset by an increase in VODA of $7 million.
    The revised VOBA and VODA have a weighted average amortization
    period of 11 years.

On June 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its
    Bermuda insurance subsidiary, MetLife International Insurance,
    Ltd. (“MLII”), to a third party for $33 million
    in cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon disposal of
    $3 million, net of income tax. The net assets of MLII at
    disposal were $27 million. A liability of $1 million
    was recorded with respect to a guarantee provided in connection
    with this disposition.

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Travelers for $12.1 billion. The acquisition was accounted
    for using the purchase method of accounting. The net fair value
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed totaled
    $7.8 billion, resulting in goodwill of $4.3 billion.
    The initial consideration paid by the Company in 2005 for the
    acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1.0 billion to Citigroup and
    $100 million in other transaction costs. The Company
    revised the purchase price as a result of the finalization by
    both parties of their review of the June 30, 2005 financial
    statements and final resolution as to the interpretation of the
    provisions of the acquisition agreement which resulted in a
    payment of additional consideration of $115 million by the
    Company to Citigroup in 2006.

Industry
    Trends

The Company’s segments continue to be influenced by a
    variety of trends that affect the industry.

Financial and Economic Environment.

Our
    results of operations are materially affected by conditions in
    the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in
    the United States and elsewhere around the world. The stress
    experienced by global capital markets that began in the second
    half of 2007 has continued and substantially increased; since
    mid- September 2008, the global financial markets have
    experienced unprecedented disruption, adversely affecting the
    business environment in general, as well as the financial
    services industry, in particular. There is consensus in the
    economic community that the U.S. economy is in a recession.

Throughout 2008 and continuing in 2009, Congress, the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Treasury and other
    agencies of the Federal government took a number of increasingly
    aggressive actions (in addition to continuing a series of
    interest rate reductions that began in the second half of
    2007) intended to provide liquidity to financial
    institutions and markets, to avert a loss of investor confidence
    in particular troubled institutions and to prevent or contain
    the spread of the financial crisis. How and to whom the
    U.S. Treasury distributes amounts available under the
    governmental programs could have the effect of supporting some
    aspects of the financial services industry more than others or
    provide advantages to some of our competitors. Governments in
    many of the foreign markets in which MetLife operates have also
    responded to address market imbalances and have taken meaningful
    steps intended to restore market confidence. We cannot predict
    whether the U.S. or foreign governments will establish
    additional governmental programs or the impact any additional
    measures or existing programs will have on the financial
    markets, whether on the levels of volatility currently being
    experienced, the levels of lending by financial institutions the
    prices buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or
    otherwise. See “Business — Regulation —
    Governmental Responses to Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

The economic crisis and the resulting recession have had and
    will continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results
    of companies in the financial services industry, including the
    Company. The declining financial markets and economic conditions
    have negatively impacted our investment income and the demand
    for and the cost and profitability of certain of our products,
    including variable annuities and guarantee riders. See
    “— Results of Operations” and
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    Extraordinary Market Conditions.



Demographics.

In the coming decade, a key
    driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will
    be the rising income protection, wealth accumulation and needs
    of the retiring Baby Boomers. As a result of increasing
    longevity, retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings
    to finance retirements that may span 30 or more years. Helping
    the Baby Boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and
    subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income
    represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry.

Life insurers are well positioned to address the Baby
    Boomers’ rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for
    income protection. The Company believes that, among life
    insurers, those with strong brands, high financial strength
    ratings and broad distribution, are best positioned to
    capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection
    products to Baby Boomers.

Moreover, the life insurance industry’s products and the
    needs they are designed to address are complex. The Company
    believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need
    to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and
    that, in the workplace, as employees take greater responsibility
    for their benefit options and retirement planning, they will
    need information about their possible individual needs. One of
    the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the
    delivery of this information in a cost effective manner.

Competitive Pressures.

The life insurance
    industry remains highly competitive. The product development and
    product life-cycles have shortened in many product segments,
    leading to more intense competition with respect to product
    features. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand
    equity, product development, technology and risk management,
    which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth
    in the life insurance industry. In addition, several of the
    industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to
    intense price competition. Sufficient scale, financial strength
    and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for
    sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market
    participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional
    distribution capability and the information technology needed to
    offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly
    sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the
    turbulence in financial markets that began in the latter half of
    2008, its impact on the capital position of many competitors,
    and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have
    highlighted financial strength as the most significant
    differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain
    distributors. In addition, the financial market turbulence and
    the economic recession have led many companies in our industry
    to re-examine the pricing and features of the products they
    offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance
    industry.

Regulatory Changes.

The life insurance
    industry is regulated at the state level, with some products and
    services also subject to federal regulation. As life insurers
    introduce new and often more complex products, regulators refine
    capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for
    the life insurance industry. Regulations recently adopted or
    currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and
    capital requirements of the industry. In addition, regulators
    have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several
    markets or products, including equity-indexed annuities,
    variable annuities and group products. We expect the regulation
    of the financial services industry to receive renewed scrutiny
    as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets in 2008.
    It is possible that significant regulatory reforms could be
    implemented. We cannot predict whether any such reforms will be
    adopted, the form they will take or their effect upon us. We
    also cannot predict how the various government responses to the
    current financial and economic difficulties will affect the
    financial services and insurance industries or the standing of
    particular companies, including our Company, within those
    industries.

Pension Plans.

On August 17, 2006,
    President Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006
    (“PPA”) into law. The PPA is a comprehensive reform of
    defined benefit and defined contribution plan rules. The
    provisions of the PPA may, over time, have a significant impact
    on demand for pension, retirement savings, and lifestyle
    protection products in both the institutional and retail
    markets. While the impact of the PPA is generally expected to be
    positive over time, these changes may have adverse short-term
    effects on the Company’s business as plan sponsors may
    react to these changes in a variety of ways as the new rules and
    related regulations begin to take effect. In response to the
    current financial and economic environment, President Bush
    signed into the law the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery
    Act (the “Employer Recovery Act”) in December 2008.
    This Act is intended to, among other things, ease the transition
    of certain funding requirements of the PPA for defined benefit
    plans. The financial and economic environment and the enactment
    of the Employer Recovery Act may delay the timing or change the
    nature of qualified plan sponsor actions and, in turn, affect
    the Company’s business.



Summary
    of Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

(i)

the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted
    market values;

(ii)

investment impairments;

(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investment entities;

(iv)

the application of the consolidation rules to certain
    investments;

(v)

the existence and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives
    requiring bifurcation;

(vi)

the estimated fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

(vii)

the capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment
    and amortization of VOBA;

(viii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(ix)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

(x)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(xi)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

(xii)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(xiii)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying the Company’s accounting policies,
    management makes subjective and complex judgments that
    frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently
    uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related
    judgments are common in the insurance and financial services
    industries; others are specific to the Company’s businesses
    and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Fair
    Value

As described below, certain assets and liabilities are measured
    at estimated fair value on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. In addition, these footnotes to the consolidated
    financial statements include disclosures of estimated fair
    values. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
    (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value as
    the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
    In many cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry)
    price will be the same at initial recognition. However, in
    certain cases, the transaction price may not represent fair
    value. Under SFAS 157, fair value of a liability is based
    on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a
    third party with the same credit standing. SFAS 157
    requires that fair value be a market-based measurement in which
    the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction
    at the measurement date, considered from the perspective of a
    market participant. When quoted prices are not used to determine
    fair value, SFAS 157 requires consideration of three broad
    valuation techniques: (i) the market approach,
    (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost approach.
    The approaches are not new, but SFAS 157 requires that
    entities determine the most appropriate valuation technique to
    use, given what is being measured and the availability of
    sufficient inputs. SFAS 157 prioritizes the inputs to fair
    valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable
    inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
    The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured
    at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on
    the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation
    technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
    to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset



or liability’s classification within the fair value
    hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to
    its valuation. SFAS 157 defines the input levels as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

The measurement and disclosures under SFAS 157 in the
    accompanying financial statements and footnotes exclude certain
    items such as nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at estimated fair value in a business
    combination, reporting units measured at estimated fair value in
    the first step of a goodwill impairment test and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair
    value for impairment assessment. The effective date for these
    items was deferred to January 1, 2009.

Prior to adoption of SFAS 157, estimated fair value was
    determined based solely upon the perspective of the reporting
    entity. Therefore, methodologies used to determine the estimated
    fair value of certain financial instruments prior to
    January 1, 2008, while being deemed appropriate under
    existing accounting guidance, may not have produced an exit
    value as defined in SFAS 157.

Estimated
    Fair Values of Investments

The Company’s investments in fixed maturity and equity
    securities, investments in trading securities, certain
    short-term investments, most mortgage loans

held-for-sale,

and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are reported at
    their estimated fair value. In determining the estimated fair
    value of these investments, various methodologies, assumptions
    and inputs are utilized, as described further below.

When available, the estimated fair value of securities is based
    on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and
    regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most liquid of
    the Company’s securities holdings and valuation of these
    securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard
    valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to:
    interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or counterparty,
    industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions,
    sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated duration and
    management’s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated
    future cash flows. Accordingly, the estimated fair values are
    based on available market information and management’s
    judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.



When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans

held-for-sale

are determined based on observable pricing of residential
    mortgage loans

held-for-sale

with similar characteristics, or observable pricing for
    securities backed by similar types of loans, adjusted to convert
    the securities prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market
    prices are not available. When observable pricing for similar
    loans or securities that are backed by similar loans are not
    available, the estimated fair values of residential mortgage
    loans

held-for-sale

are determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgages have also been designated
    as

held-for-sale

which are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated
    fair value less expected disposition costs determined on an
    individual loan basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is
    determined using independent broker quotations or, when the loan
    is in foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral
    estimated using internal models.

Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are measured at
    estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated
    from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the
    servicing rights are retained by the Company. The estimated fair
    value of MSRs is principally determined through the use of
    internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various
    assumptions as to discount rates, loan-prepayments, and
    servicing costs. The use of different valuation assumptions and
    inputs as well as assumptions relating to the collection of
    expected cash flows may have a material effect on MSRs estimated
    fair values.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

Investment
    Impairments

One of the significant estimates related to

available-for-sale

securities is the evaluation of investments for

other-than-temporary

impairments. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred
    is based on management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of securities: (i) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and
    (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had
    declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater. An extended and severe
    unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not
    have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all
    scheduled interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows, as
    well as the Company’s ability and intent to hold the
    security, including holding the security until the earlier of a
    recovery in value, or until maturity. In contrast, for certain
    equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given by
    the Company to a decline in estimated fair value and the
    likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:

(i)

the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair
    value has been below cost or amortized cost;



(ii)

the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties;

(iii)

the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or

sub-sector;

(iv)

the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed
    geographic locations;

(v)

the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer,
    series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type
    of loss or has exhausted natural resources;

(vi)

the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value
    to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost;

(vii)

unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed
    and asset-backed securities; and

(viii)

other subjective factors, including concentrations and
    information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

The cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for
    impairments in value deemed to be other-than temporary in the
    period in which the determination is made. These impairments are
    included within net investment gains (losses) and the cost basis
    of the fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced
    accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis
    for subsequent recoveries in value.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on
    other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based
    upon the Company’s periodic evaluation and assessment of
    known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset
    class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as
    conditions change and new information becomes available.
    Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects
    changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such
    evaluations are revised.

Recognition
    of Income on Certain Investment Entities

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain structured investment
    transactions, trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market
    conditions, which could result in prepayments and changes in
    amounts to be earned.

Application
    of the Consolidation Rules to Certain Investments

Additionally, the Company has invested in certain structured
    transactions that are VIEs under Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51

(“FIN 46(r)”). These
    structured transactions include reinsurance trusts, asset-backed
    securitizations, trust preferred securities, joint ventures,
    limited partnerships and limited liability companies. The
    Company is required to consolidate those VIEs for which it is
    deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The accounting rules under
    FIN 46(r) for the determination of when an entity is a VIE
    and when to consolidate a VIE are complex. The determination of
    the VIE’s primary beneficiary requires an evaluation of the
    contractual rights and obligations associated with each party
    involved in the entity, an estimate of the entity’s
    expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation
    of such estimates to each party involved in the entity. FIN
    46(r) defines the primary beneficiary as the entity that will
    absorb a majority of a VIE’s expected losses, receive a
    majority of a VIE’s expected residual returns if no single
    entity absorbs a majority of expected losses, or both.

When determining the primary beneficiary for structured
    investment products such as asset-backed securitizations and
    collateralized debt obligations, the Company uses historical
    default probabilities based on the credit rating of each issuer
    and other inputs including maturity dates, industry
    classifications and geographic location. Using computational
    algorithms, the analysis simulates default scenarios resulting
    in a range of expected losses and the probability associated
    with each occurrence. For other investment structures such as
    trust preferred securities, joint ventures, limited partnerships
    and limited liability companies, the Company gains an
    understanding of the design of the VIE and generally uses a
    qualitative approach to determine if it is the primary
    beneficiary. This approach includes an analysis of all
    contractual rights and obligations held by all parties including
    profit and loss allocations, repayment or residual value
    guarantees, put and call options and other derivative
    instruments. If the primary beneficiary of a VIE can not be
    identified using this qualitative approach, the Company
    calculates the



expected losses and expected residual returns of the VIE using a
    probability-weighted cash flow model. The use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the determination of
    the primary beneficiary could have a material effect on the
    amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company enters into freestanding derivative transactions
    including swaps, forwards, futures and option contracts. The
    Company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks. The
    risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in
    estimated fair values related to financial instruments and
    currency exposure associated with net investments in certain
    foreign operations. To a lesser extent, the Company uses credit
    derivatives, such as credit default swaps, to synthetically
    replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily
    available in the cash market.

The estimated fair value of derivatives is determined through
    the use of quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivatives
    and financial forwards to sell residential mortgage-backed
    securities or through the use of pricing models for

over-the-counter

derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The significant inputs to the pricing models for most

over-the-counter

derivatives are inputs that are observable in the market or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data. Significant inputs that are observable generally include:
    interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rate
    curves, credit curves, and volatility. However, certain

over-the-counter

derivatives may rely on inputs that are significant to the
    estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or
    cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable
    market data. Significant inputs that are unobservable generally
    include: independent broker quotes, credit correlation
    assumptions, references to emerging market currencies, and
    inputs that are outside the observable portion of the interest
    rate curve, credit curve, volatility, or other relevant market
    measure. These unobservable inputs may involve significant
    management judgment or estimation. Even though unobservable,
    these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given
    the circumstances and consistent with what other market
    participants would use when pricing such instruments. Most
    inputs for

over-the-counter

derivatives are mid market inputs but, in certain cases, bid
    level inputs are used when they are deemed more representative
    of exit value. Market liquidity as well as the use of different
    methodologies, assumptions and inputs may have a material effect
    on the estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives
    and could materially affect net income. Also, fluctuations in
    the estimated fair value of derivatives which have not been
    designated for hedge accounting may result in significant
    volatility in net income.

The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are
    considered in determining the estimated fair value for all

over-the-counter

derivatives after taking into account the effects of netting
    agreements and collateral arrangements. Credit risk is monitored
    and consideration of any potential credit adjustment is based on
    a net exposure by counterparty. This is due to the existence of
    netting agreements and collateral arrangements which effectively
    serve to mitigate credit risk. The Company values its derivative
    positions using the standard swap curve which includes a credit
    risk adjustment. This credit risk adjustment is appropriate for
    those parties that execute trades at pricing levels consistent
    with the standard swap curve. As the Company and its significant
    derivative counterparties consistently execute trades at such
    pricing levels, additional credit risk adjustments are not
    currently required in the valuation process. The need for such
    additional credit risk adjustments is monitored by the Company.
    The Company’s ability to consistently execute at such
    pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and
    collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its
    significant derivative counterparties. The evaluation of the
    requirement to make an additional credit risk adjustments is
    performed by the Company each reporting period.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it was
    determined that



hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied,
    reported net income could be materially affected. Differences in
    judgment as to the availability and application of hedge
    accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment
    may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial
    statements of the Company from that previously reported.
    Assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of
    ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to
    interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or
    estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in
    net income.

Embedded
    Derivatives

Embedded derivatives principally include certain variable
    annuity riders and certain guaranteed investment contracts with
    equity or bond indexed crediting rates. Embedded derivatives are
    recorded in the financial statements at estimated fair value
    with changes in estimated fair value adjusted through net income.

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders. These include guaranteed
    minimum withdrawal benefit (“GMWB”) riders, guaranteed
    minimum accumulation benefit (“GMAB”) riders, and
    certain guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”)
    riders. GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB riders are embedded
    derivatives, which are measured at estimated fair value
    separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes
    in estimated fair value reported in net investment gains
    (losses).

The estimated fair value for these riders is estimated using the
    present value of future benefits minus the present value of
    future fees using actuarial and capital market assumptions
    related to the projected cash flows over the expected lives of
    the contracts. The projections of future benefits and future
    fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including
    expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral
    valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from
    the riders are projected under multiple capital market scenarios
    using observable risk free rates. Beginning in 2008, the
    valuation of these embedded derivatives now includes an
    adjustment for the Company’s own credit and risk margins
    for non-capital market inputs. The Company’s own credit
    adjustment is determined taking into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt as
    well as its claims paying ability. Risk margins are established
    to capture the non-capital market risks of the instrument which
    represent the additional compensation a market participant would
    require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such
    actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency,
    partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk
    margins requires the use of significant management judgment.

These riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the
    Company’s own credit standing; and variations in actuarial
    assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the riders that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB riders described in the preceding paragraphs. The value
    of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined
    using a methodology consistent with that described previously
    for the riders directly written by the Company.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain guaranteed investment contracts
    is determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for the
    Company’s own credit that takes into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt as
    well as its claims paying ability. Changes in equity and bond
    indices, interest rates and the Company’s credit standing
    may result in significant fluctuations in estimated the fair
    value of these embedded derivatives that could materially affect
    net income.

The accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and
    interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to
    evolve in practice. If interpretations change, there is a risk
    that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation
    and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated
    financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair
    value could materially affect net income.



Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a
    life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of
    the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right
    to receive future cash flows from the business in-force at the
    acquisition date. VOBA is based on actuarially determined
    projections, by each block of business, of future policy and
    contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate
    account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment
    returns and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased
    business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC
    and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the
    related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial
    statements for reporting purposes.

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is
    re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those
    previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins. When expected
    future gross margins are below those previously estimated, the
    DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current
    period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    expected future gross margins are above the previously estimated
    expected future gross margins. Total DAC and VOBA amortization
    during a particular period may increase or decrease depending
    upon the relative size of the amortization change resulting from
    the adjustment to DAC and VOBA for the update of actual gross
    margins and the re-estimation of expected future gross margins.
    Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross
    margins for each block of business to determine the
    recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the



contracts. The amount of future gross profits is dependent
    principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to
    policyholders, mortality, persistency, interest crediting rates,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, the effect of any hedges used, and
    certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors,
    the Company anticipates that investment returns, expenses, and
    persistency are reasonably likely to impact significantly the
    rate of DAC and VOBA amortization. Each reporting period, the
    Company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual
    gross profits for that period. When the actual gross profits
    change from previously estimated gross profits, the cumulative
    DAC and VOBA amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a
    cumulative charge or credit to current operations. When actual
    gross profits exceed those previously estimated, the DAC and
    VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current period
    charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the actual
    gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits.
    Each reporting period, the Company also updates the actual
    amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected
    future gross profits. When expected future gross profits are
    below those previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization
    will increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings.
    The opposite result occurs when the expected future gross
    profits are above the previously estimated expected future gross
    profits. Total DAC and VOBA amortization during a particular
    period may increase or decrease depending upon the relative size
    of the amortization change resulting from the adjustment to DAC
    and VOBA for the update of actual gross profits and the
    re-estimation of expected future gross profits. Each period, the
    Company also reviews the estimated gross profits for each block
    of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA
    balances.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the
    Company’s long-term expectation produce higher account
    balances, which increases the Company’s future fee
    expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations
    on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in
    higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs
    when returns are lower than the Company’s long-term
    expectation. The Company’s practice to determine the impact
    of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts
    assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not
    changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed
    when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company
    monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its
    long-term expectation changes. The effect of an
    increase/(decrease) by 100 basis points in the assumed
    future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a
    decrease/(increase) in the DAC and VOBA balances of
    approximately $110 million with an offset to the
    Company’s unearned revenue liability of approximately
    $20 million for this factor. During 2008, the Company did
    not change its long-term expectation of equity market
    appreciation.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Over the last several years, the Company’s most significant
    assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future
    gross margins and profits and the amortization of DAC and VOBA
    have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment
    returns, expenses, in-force or persistency assumptions and
    policyholder dividends on contracts included within the
    Individual segment. During 2008, the amount of net investment
    gains (losses) as well as the level of separate account balances
    also resulted in significant changes to expected future gross
    margins and profits impacting amortization of DAC and VOBA. The
    Company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably
    likely to cause significant changes in the future. Changes in
    these assumptions can be offsetting and the Company is unable to
    predict their movement or offsetting impact over time.

Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements provides a rollforward of DAC and VOBA for the
    Company for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006 as well as a breakdown of DAC and VOBA by segment and
    reporting unit at December 31, 2008 and 2007. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, DAC and VOBA for the Company
    was $20.1 billion and $17.8 billion, respectively. A
    substantial portion, approximately



80%, of the Company’s DAC and VOBA is associated with the
    Individual segment which had DAC and VOBA of $16.5 billion
    and $14.0 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008
    and 2007. Amortization of DAC and VOBA associated with the
    variable & universal life and the annuities reporting
    units within the Individual segment are significantly impacted
    by movements in equity markets. The following chart illustrates
    the effect on DAC and VOBA within the Company’s Individual
    segment of changing each of the respective assumptions as well
    as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross
    margins or profits during the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006. Increases (decreases) in DAC and VOBA
    balances, as presented below, result in a corresponding decrease
    (increase) in amortization.

Prior to 2008, fluctuations in the amounts presented in the
    table above arose principally from normal assumption reviews
    during the period. During 2008, there was a significant increase
    in DAC and VOBA amortization attributable to the following:

•

The decrease in equity markets during the year significantly
    lowered separate account balances resulting in a significant
    reduction in expected future gross profits on variable universal
    life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting
    in an increase of $708 million in DAC and VOBA amortization.

•

Changes in net investment gains (losses) resulted in the
    following changes in DAC and VOBA amortization:

–

Actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in
    liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable
    annuities resulting in a reduction of DAC and VOBA amortization
    of $1,047 million. This decrease in actual gross profits
    was mitigated by freestanding derivative gains associated with
    the hedging of such guarantee obligations which resulted in an
    increase in actual gross profits and an increase in DAC and VOBA
    amortization of $625 million.

–

A change in valuation of guarantee liabilities, resulting from
    the adoption of SFAS 157 during 2008, also impacted the
    computation of actual gross profits and the related amortization
    of DAC and VOBA. The addition of risk margins increased the
    guarantee liability valuations, decreased actual gross profits
    and decreased amortization by $100 million. Offsetting this
    was the addition of own credit to the valuation of guarantee
    liabilities. Own credit decreased guarantee liability
    valuations, increased actual gross profits and increased
    amortization by $739 million. The inclusion of the
    Company’s own credit in the valuation of these guarantee
    liabilities’ increases the volatility of these valuations,
    the related DAC and VOBA amortization, and the net income of the
    Company.

–

As more extensively described in Note 9 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, reductions in both actual and
    expected cumulative earnings of the closed block resulting from
    recent experience in the closed block combined with changes in
    expected dividend scales resulted in an increase in closed block
    DAC amortization of $195 million, $175 million of
    which is related to net investment gains (losses).

–

The remainder of the impact of net investment gains (losses) on
    DAC amortization of $129 million was attributable to
    numerous immaterial items.

•

Increases in amortization in 2008 resulting from changes in
    assumptions related to in-force/persistency of $159 million
    were driven by higher than anticipated mortality and lower than
    anticipated premium persistency during the current year.



The Company’s DAC and VOBA balance is also impacted by
    unrealized investment gains (losses) and the amount of
    amortization which would have been recognized if such gains and
    losses had been recognized. The significant increase in
    unrealized investment losses at December 31, 2008 resulted
    in an increase in DAC and VOBA of $3.4 billion.
    Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements include the DAC and VOBA offset to unrealized
    investment losses.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill
    impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based
    upon data as of the close of the second quarter.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, a significant portion of goodwill
    within Corporate & Other is allocated to reporting
    units within the Company’s business segments.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated
    fair value, there is an indication of impairment and the implied
    fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as
    the amount of goodwill would be determined in a business
    acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of goodwill over
    the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized as an
    impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.

In performing its goodwill impairment tests, when management
    believes meaningful comparable market data are available, the
    estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined
    using a market multiple approach. When relevant comparables are
    not available, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model.
    For reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market
    assumptions, such as the annuities and variable &
    universal life reporting units within the Individual segment,
    the Company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using
    additional valuation methodologies.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining fair value include projected operating earnings,
    current book value (with and without accumulated other
    comprehensive income), the level of economic capital required to
    support the mix of business, long term growth rates, comparative
    market multiples, the account value of in-force business,
    projections of new and renewal business as well as margins on
    such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity market levels, and the discount rate management believes
    appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of the annuity and
    variable & universal life reporting units are
    particularly sensitive to the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, management also considers
    the Company’s market capitalization in relation to its book
    value. Management believes that the overall decrease in the
    Company’s current market capitalization is not
    representative of a long-term decrease in the value of the
    underlying reporting units.

Management applies significant judgment when determining the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units and
    when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the
    estimated fair value of its reporting units and their book
    value. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key
    judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change.
    Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent
    only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future
    developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions
    upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood,
    differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in
    the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units
    could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which
    could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations or financial position.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Continued deteriorating or adverse



market conditions for certain reporting units may have a
    significant impact on the estimated fair value of these
    reporting units and could result in future impairments of
    goodwill.

    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    — Goodwill” for further consideration of goodwill
    impairment testing during 2008.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. These
    assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and
    are intended to estimate the experience for the period the
    policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these assumptions,
    liabilities are established on a block of business basis. If
    experience is less favorable than assumptions, additional
    liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to
    policyholder benefits and claims.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Other policyholder funds include claims that have been
    reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on
    life and non-medical health insurance. Liabilities for unpaid
    claims are estimated based upon the Company’s historical
    experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the
    effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk
    management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and
    subrogation. The effects of changes in such estimated
    liabilities are included in the results of operations in the
    period in which the changes occur.

Future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income
    benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and
    secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life
    policies are based on estimates of the expected value of
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. Liabilities for universal
    and variable life secondary guarantees and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent
    with those used for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the
    same variability and risk. The assumptions of investment
    performance and volatility for variable products are consistent
    with historical S&P experience.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.

Income
    Taxes

Income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the
    Company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing
    jurisdictions in connection with its operations. The Company
    provides for federal, state and foreign income taxes currently
    payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences
    between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
    liabilities. The Company’s accounting for income taxes
    represents management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.



Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The
    realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of
    sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward
    periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction.
    Valuation allowances are established when management determines,
    based on available information, that it is more likely than not
    that deferred income tax assets will not be realized. Factors in
    management’s determination consider the performance of the
    business including the ability to generate capital gains.
    Significant judgment is required in determining whether
    valuation allowances should be established, as well as the
    amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company determines whether it is more likely than not that a
    tax position will be sustained upon examination by the
    appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is
    recorded in the financial statements. A tax position is measured
    at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than
    50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. The
    Company may be required to change its provision for income taxes
    when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged
    by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining
    valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly
    change, or when receipt of new information indicates the need
    for adjustment in valuation allowances. Additionally, future
    events, such as changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or
    interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an
    impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax
    rate. Any such changes could significantly affect the amounts
    reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year
    these changes occur.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties. Accounting for reinsurance requires
    extensive use of assumptions and estimates, particularly related
    to the future performance of the underlying business and the
    potential impact of counterparty credit risks. The Company
    periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared
    to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and
    liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and
    evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its
    reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated
    in the security impairment process discussed previously.
    Additionally, for each of its reinsurance agreements, the
    Company determines if the agreement provides indemnification
    against loss or liability relating to insurance risk, in
    accordance with applicable accounting standards. The Company
    reviews all contractual features, particularly those that may
    limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is
    subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of
    claims. If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement
    does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    agreement using the deposit method of accounting.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans
    covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements.
    The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data, and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results



due to, among other factors, changing market and economic
    conditions and changes in participant demographics. These
    differences may have a significant effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements and liquidity.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
    estimated. Liabilities related to certain lawsuits, including
    the Company’s asbestos-related liability, are especially
    difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data
    and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect
    liability estimates. The data and variables that impact the
    assumptions used to estimate the Company’s asbestos-related
    liability include the number of future claims, the cost to
    resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in
    pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new
    claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the
    law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible
    impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to
    allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the Company when
    exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos
    exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future
    adverse verdicts and their amounts. On a quarterly and annual
    basis, the Company reviews relevant information with respect to
    liabilities for litigation, regulatory investigations and
    litigation-related contingencies to be reflected in the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. It is possible
    that an adverse outcome in certain of the Company’s
    litigation and regulatory investigations, including
    asbestos-related cases, or the use of different assumptions in
    the determination of amounts recorded could have a material
    effect upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash
    flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.

Economic
    Capital

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.
    This is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk-based
    capital (“RBC”) formula, which is not as refined in
    its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the
    Company’s businesses.

The Institutional segment’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to a decrease in net
    investment losses and a decrease in policyholder benefits due to
    investment losses shared by policyholders. There was also a
    decrease in other expenses due in part to lower expenses related
    to DAC amortization which is primarily



due to the impact of the implementation of

SOP 05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”)

in the prior year and amortization refinements in the current
    year. These increases were offset by lower underwriting results
    in retirement & savings, non-medical
    health & other, and group life businesses. There was
    also a decrease in interest margins within the
    retirement & savings and non-medical
    health & other businesses, partially offset by an
    increase in the group life business.

The Individual segment’s income from continuing operations
    decreased due to higher DAC amortization partially offset by a
    decrease in net investment losses due to an increase in gains on
    freestanding derivatives partially offset by losses primarily
    relating to embedded derivatives and fixed maturity securities
    including those resulting from intersegment transfers of
    securities. The embedded derivative losses are net of gains
    relating to the effect of the widening of the Company’s own
    credit spread. Income from continuing operations also decreased
    due to decreases in interest margins, unfavorable underwriting
    results in life products, an increase in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, higher annuity benefits, lower
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees combined
    with other revenues, and an increase in policyholder dividends.
    These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in other
    expenses as well as an increase in net investment income on
    blocks of business not driven by interest margins.

The International segment’s decrease in income from
    continuing operations was primarily due to a decrease in income
    from continuing operations relating to Argentina and Japan. The
    decrease in Argentina’s income from continuing operations
    was due to the negative impact the 2007 pension reform had on
    current year income from continuing operations. The decrease was
    partially offset by the net impact resulting from the Argentine
    nationalization of the private pension system as well as
    refinements to certain contingent and insurance liabilities
    associated with a Supreme Court ruling. The Company’s
    earnings from its investment in Japan decreased due to an
    increase in losses on embedded derivatives associated with
    variable annuity riders, an increase in DAC amortization related
    to market performance and the impact of a refinement in
    assumptions for the guaranteed annuity business partially offset
    by the favorable impact from the utilization of the fair value
    option for certain fixed annuities. The Company’s results
    were also impacted by a decrease in earnings from assumed
    reinsurance, offset by an increase in income from hedging
    activities associated with Japan’s guaranteed annuity
    benefits. These decreases were offset by an increase in net
    investment gains which was due to an increase from gains on
    derivatives primarily in Japan partially offset by losses
    primarily on fixed maturity investments. There was also an
    increase in income from continuing operations relating to Hong
    Kong associated with the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon
    acquired in the in the second quarter of 2007.

The Auto & Home segment’s decrease in income from
    continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase
    in net investment losses and an increase in policyholder
    benefits and claims. The increase in net investment losses was
    due to an increase in losses on fixed maturity and equity
    securities. The increase in policyholder benefits and claims was
    comprised primarily of an increase in catastrophe losses offset
    by a decrease in non-catastrophe policyholder benefits and
    claims. Offsetting these decreases was an increase in premiums.

Income from continuing operations for Corporate &
    Other decreased due to lower net investment income as well as
    higher corporate expenses, interest expense, legal costs and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances. These
    decreases were offset by an increase in net investment gains,
    higher other revenues, lower interest on uncertain tax
    positions, and lower interest credited to bankholder deposits.
    The increase in net investment gains was primarily due to an
    elimination of losses which were recognized by other segments,
    partially offset by losses on fixed maturity securities and
    derivatives.

The Institutional segment’s increase in premiums, fees and
    other revenues was primarily due to increases in the
    retirement & savings, non-medical health &
    other and group life businesses. The increase in the
    retirement & savings business was primarily due to
    increases in premiums in the group institutional annuity,
    structured settlement and global GIC businesses. The increase in
    both group institutional annuity and the structured settlement
    businesses were primarily due to higher sales. The increase in
    the group institutional annuity business was primarily due to
    large domestic sales and the first significant sales in the
    United Kingdom business in the current year. The growth in the
    non-medical health & other business was largely due to
    increases in the dental, disability, accidental
    death & dismemberment (“AD&D”), and
    individual disability insurance (“IDI”) businesses.
    The increase in the dental business was primarily due to organic
    growth in the business and the impact of an acquisition that
    closed in the first quarter of 2008. The increase in group life
    business was primarily due to an increase in term life, which
    was largely attributable to business growth, partially offset by
    a decrease in assumed reinsurance.

The Individual segment’s decrease in premiums, fees and
    other revenues was primarily attributable to decreases in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and other
    revenues. These decreases were due to lower average separate
    account balances due to unfavorable equity market performance
    during the current year, as well as revisions to
    management’s assumptions used to determine estimated gross
    profits and margins. These decreases were partially offset by
    universal life business growth over the prior year.

The International segment’s increase in premiums, fees and
    other revenues was primarily due to business growth in the Latin
    America region, as well as the impact of an acquisition in the
    Asia Pacific region, and the impact of foreign currency exchange
    rates. Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher annuity sales, as well as higher
    institutional premiums from its traditional and bank
    distribution channels. Mexico’s premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased primarily due to growth in its individual and
    institutional businesses, as well as the reinstatement of
    premiums from prior periods. Hong Kong’s increase was due
    to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife
    Fubon in the second quarter of 2007 and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation beginning in the third quarter of
    2007. The United Kingdom’s premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased primarily due to growth in the reinsurance
    business as well as the prior year impact of an unearned premium
    calculation refinement. South Korea’s premiums, fees and
    other revenues increased due to growth in its guaranteed annuity
    and variable universal life businesses, as well as in its
    traditional business. Australia’s premiums, fees and other
    revenues increased primarily due to growth in the institutional
    business and an increase in retention levels. These increases in
    premiums, fees and other revenues were partially offset by a
    decrease in Argentina primarily due to a decrease in premiums in
    the pension business, for which pension reform eliminated the
    obligation of plan administrators to provide death and
    disability coverage effective January 1, 2008.

The Auto & Home segment reflected no change when
    compared to the prior year although a slight increase in
    premiums was offset by lower other revenues.

The increase in Corporate & Other premiums, fees and
    other revenues was primarily related to MetLife Bank loan
    origination and servicing fees from acquisitions in 2008 and an
    adjustment of surrender values on corporate-owned life insurance
    (“COLI”) policies in the prior year, partially offset
    by lower revenue from a prior year resolution of an
    indemnification claim associated with the 2000 acquisition of
    GALIC.



Net
    Investment Income

Net investment income decreased by $1,767 million, or 10%,
    to $16,296 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 from $18,063 million for the comparable 2007 period.
    Management attributes $3,141 million of this change to a
    decrease in yields, partially offset by an increase of
    $1,374 million due to growth in average invested assets.
    Average invested assets are calculated on cost basis without
    unrealized gains and losses. The decrease in net investment
    income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower
    returns on other limited partnership interests, real estate
    joint ventures, short-term investments, fixed maturity
    securities, and mortgage loans, partially offset by improved
    securities lending results. Management anticipates that the
    significant volatility in the equity, real estate and credit
    markets will continue in 2009 which could continue to impact net
    investment income and yields on other limited partnership
    interests and real estate joint ventures. The decrease in net
    investment income attributable to lower yields was partially
    offset by increased net investment income attributable to an
    increase in average invested assets on an amortized cost basis,
    primarily within short-term investments, mortgage loans, other
    limited partnership interests, and real estate joint ventures.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account
    balances decreased in the Individual segment for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. The
    decrease in interest margin within the Individual segment was
    primarily attributable to a decline in net investment income due
    to lower returns on other limited partnership interests, real
    estate joint ventures, other invested assets including
    derivatives, and short term investments, all of which were
    partially offset by higher securities lending results. Interest
    margins decreased in the retirement & savings and
    non-medical health & other businesses, but increased
    within the group life business, all within the Institutional
    segment. Interest earned approximates net investment income on
    investable assets attributed to the segment with minor
    adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate
    accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited is the amount attributed to insurance products,
    recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the amount
    credited to policyholder account balances for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. Interest credited on insurance products reflects the
    current period impact of the interest rate assumptions
    established at issuance or acquisition. Interest credited to
    policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms,
    including some minimum guarantees. This tends to move gradually
    over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may
    reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures and, therefore, generally does not introduce
    volatility in expense.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment losses decreased by $2,390 million to a gain
    of $1,812 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from a loss of $578 million for the comparable 2007 period.
    The decrease in net investment losses is due to an increase in
    gains on derivatives partially offset by losses primarily on
    fixed maturity and equity securities. Derivative gains were
    driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were partially
    offset by losses on embedded derivatives primarily associated
    with variable annuity riders. Gains on freestanding derivatives
    increased by $6,499 million and were primarily driven by:
    i) gains on certain interest rate swaps, floors, and
    swaptions which were economic hedges of certain investment
    assets and liabilities, ii) gains from foreign currency
    derivatives primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening
    as well as, iii) gains primarily from equity options,
    financial futures and interest rate swaps hedging the embedded
    derivatives. The gains on these equity options, financial
    futures, and interest rate swaps substantially offset the change
    in the underlying embedded derivative liability that is hedged
    by these derivatives. Losses on the embedded derivatives
    increased by $2,329 million and were driven by declining
    interest rates and poor equity market performance throughout the
    year. These embedded derivative losses include a
    $2,994 million gain resulting from the effect of the
    widening of the Company’s own credit spread which is
    required to be used in the valuation of these variable annuity
    rider embedded derivatives under SFAS 157 which became
    effective January 1, 2008. The remaining change in net
    investment losses of $1,780 million is principally
    attributable to an increase in losses on fixed maturity and
    equity securities, and, to a lesser degree, an increase in
    losses on mortgage and consumer loans and other limited
    partnership interests offset by an increase in foreign currency
    transaction gains. The increase in losses on fixed maturity and
    equity securities is primarily attributable to



an increase in impairments associated with financial services
    industry holdings which experienced losses as a result of
    bankruptcies, FDIC receivership, and federal government assisted
    capital infusion transactions in the third and fourth quarters
    of 2008. Losses on fixed maturity and equity securities were
    also driven by an increase in credit related impairments on
    communication and consumer sector security holdings, losses on
    asset-backed securities as well as an increase in losses on
    fixed maturity security holdings where the Company either lacked
    the intent to hold, or due to extensive credit widening, the
    Company was uncertain of its intent to hold these fixed maturity
    securities for a period of time sufficient to allow recovery of
    the market value decline.

Underwriting

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity or other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity or
    other insurance-related experience trends, as well as the
    reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business.
    Consequently, results can fluctuate from year to year.
    Underwriting results, including catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were unfavorable for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, as the combined ratio, including
    catastrophes, increased to 91.2% from 88.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Underwriting results, excluding
    catastrophes, in the Auto & Home segment were
    favorable for the year ended December 31, 2008, as the
    combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, decreased to 83.1% from
    86.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007. Underwriting
    results were less favorable in the non-medical
    health & other, retirement & savings and
    group life businesses in the Institutional segment. Underwriting
    results were unfavorable in the life products in the Individual
    segment.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $1,495 million, or 14%, to
    $11,924 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $10,429 million for the comparable 2007 period.

The Institutional segment’s decrease in other expenses was
    principally due to a decrease in DAC amortization primarily due
    to a charge associated with the impact of DAC and VOBA
    amortization from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in the prior year and a decrease mainly due to the impact of
    amortization refinements in the current year. This decrease was
    offset by increases in non-deferrable volume-related expenses
    and corporate support expenses. Also offsetting this decrease
    was the impact of revisions to certain pension and
    postretirement liabilities in the current year.

The Individual segment’s increase in other expenses
    included higher DAC amortization primarily related to lower
    expected future gross profits due to separate account balance
    decreases resulting from recent market declines, higher net
    investment gains primarily due to net derivative gains and the
    reduction in expected cumulative earnings of the closed block
    partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings of the closed
    block and changes in assumptions used to estimate future gross
    profits and margins. There was an additional increase due to the
    impact of revisions to certain pension and postretirement
    liabilities in the current year. The increases in other expenses
    were offset by a decrease in nondeferrable volume-related
    expenses and by the write-off of a receivable from a
    joint-venture partner in the prior year.



The International segment’s decrease in other expenses was
    driven mainly by Argentina’s prior year pension liability
    and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates. The
    decrease in Argentina’s other expenses was primarily due to
    the establishment in the prior year of a liability for pension
    servicing obligations due to pension reform, the elimination of
    the liability for pension servicing obligations and the
    elimination of DAC for the pension business in the current year
    as a result of the nationalization of the pension system, as
    well as the elimination of contingent liabilities for certain
    cases due to recent court decisions related to the pesification
    of insurance contracts by the government in 2002. This decrease
    was offset primarily by an increase in other expenses in South
    Korea, the United Kingdom, and other countries. South
    Korea’s other expenses increased primarily due to an
    increase in DAC amortization related to market performance, as
    well as higher spending on advertising and marketing, offset by
    a refinement in DAC capitalization. The United Kingdom’s
    other expenses increased due to business growth as well as lower
    DAC amortization in the prior year resulting from calculation
    refinements partially offset by foreign currency transaction
    gains. Other expenses increased in India, Chile and Mexico
    primarily due to growth initiatives. Contributions from the
    other countries accounted for the remainder of the change in
    other expenses.

The Auto & Home segment’s decrease in other
    expenses was principally as a result of lower commissions,
    decrease in surveys and underwriting reports and other
    sales-related expenses, partially offset by an unfavorable
    change in DAC capitalization, net of amortization.

The increase in other expenses in Corporate & Other
    was primarily due to higher MetLife Bank costs, higher
    post-employment related costs in the current period associated
    with the implementation of an enterprise-wide cost reduction and
    revenue enhancement initiative, higher corporate support
    expenses including incentive compensation, rent, advertising and
    information technology costs. Corporate expenses also increased
    from lease impairments for Company use space that is currently
    vacant and higher costs from MetLife Foundation contributions,
    partially offset by a reduction in deferred compensation
    expenses. Interest expense was higher due to issuances of junior
    subordinated debt in December 2007 and April 2008 and collateral
    financing arrangements in May 2007 and December 2007, partially
    offset by rate reductions on variable rate collateral financing
    arrangements in 2008, the prepayment of shares subject to
    mandatory redemption in October 2007 and the reduction of
    commercial paper outstanding. Higher legal costs were
    principally driven by costs associated with the commutation of
    three asbestos-related excess insurance policies and decreases
    in prior year legal liabilities partially offset by current year
    decreases resulting from the resolution of certain matters.
    These increases were partially offset by a reduction in
    decreases in interest credited on bankholder deposits and
    interest on uncertain tax positions.

Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was
    $1,580 million, or 31% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, versus $1,660 million, or
    29% of such income, for the comparable 2007 period. The 2008 and
    2007 effective tax rates differ from the corporate tax rate of
    35% primarily due to the impact of non-taxable investment income
    and tax credits for investments in low income housing. In
    addition, the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily
    attributable to changes in the ratio of permanent differences to
    income before income taxes.

Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax,
    decreased by $516 million to a loss of $301 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from income of
    $215 million for the comparable 2007 period. The decrease
    was primarily the result of the split-off of substantially all
    of the Company’s interest in RGA in September 2008 whereby
    stockholders of the Company were offered the ability to exchange
    their MetLife shares for shares of RGA Class B common
    stock. This resulted in a loss on disposal of discontinued
    operations of $458 million, net of income tax. Income from
    discontinued operations related to RGA’s operations also
    decreased by $54 million, net of income tax, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2008,
    the Holding Company entered into an agreement to sell its
    wholly-owned subsidiary, Cova, which resulted in a gain on
    disposal of discontinued operations of $37 million, net of
    income tax. Income from discontinued operations related to Cova
    also decreased by $14 million, net of income tax, for the
    year ended December 31, 2008. As compared to the prior
    year, there was a reduction in income from discontinued
    operations of $15 million related to the sale of SSRM and
    of $5 million related to the sale of MetLife
    Australia’s annuities and pension businesses to a third
    party. There was also a decrease in income from discontinued
    real estate operations of $7 million.

The Institutional segment’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to an increase in interest
    margins, an increase in underwriting results, lower net
    investment losses and the impact of revisions to certain
    expenses in both periods, partially offset by higher expenses
    due to an increase in non-deferrable volume-related and
    corporate support expenses and an increase in DAC amortization
    resulting from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in 2007.

The Individual segment’s income from continuing operations
    increased primarily due to a decrease in net investment losses,
    higher fee income from separate account products, higher net
    investment income on blocks of business not driven by interest
    margins and an increase in interest margins, partially offset by
    higher DAC amortization, unfavorable underwriting results in
    life products, higher general expenses, the impact of revisions
    to certain liabilities in both years, the write-off of a
    receivable in 2007, an increase in the closed block-related
    policyholder dividend obligation, higher annuity benefits,
    increase in policyholder dividends, and an increase in interest
    credited to policyholder account balances.

The increase in the International segment’s income from
    continuing operations was primarily attributable to the
    following factors:

•

An increase in Argentina’s income from continuing
    operations primarily due to a net reduction of liabilities
    resulting from pension reform, a reduction in claim liabilities
    resulting from experience reviews in both 2007 and
    2006 years, higher premiums resulting from higher pension
    contributions attributable to higher participant salaries,
    higher net investment income resulting from capital
    contributions in 2006, and a smaller increase in market indexed
    policyholder liabilities without a corresponding decrease in net
    investment income, partially offset by the reduction of cost of
    insurance fees as a result of the new pension system reform
    regulation, an increase in retention incentives related to
    pension reform, as well as lower trading portfolio income.
    Argentina also benefited, in both the current and prior years,
    from the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against which
    valuation allowances had been previously established.

•

Mexico’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities
    caused by a decrease in the unrealized investment results on
    invested assets supporting those liabilities relative to 2006,
    the favorable impact of experience refunds during the first
    quarter of 2007, a reduction in claim liabilities resulting from
    experience reviews and the adverse impact in 2006 of an
    adjustment for experience refunds in its institutional business,
    a year over year decrease in DAC amortization resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits in both 2006 and 2007, a decrease in
    liabilities based on a review of outstanding remittances, and
    growth in its institutional and universal life businesses. These
    increases in Mexico’s income from continuing operations
    were partially offset by lower fees resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits, the favorable impact in 2006 associated
    with a large group policy that was not renewed by the
    policyholder, a decrease in various one-time revenue items,



lower investment yields, the favorable impact in 2006 of
    liabilities related to employment matters that were reduced, and
    the benefit 2006 from the elimination of liabilities for pending
    claims that were determined to be invalid following a review.

•

Taiwan’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily driven by an increase due to higher DAC amortization
    in 2006 resulting from a loss recognition adjustment and
    restructuring costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of
    liability refinements in 2006, as well as higher policyholder
    liabilities related to loss recognition in 2006.

•

Brazil’s income from continuing operations increased due to
    the unfavorable impact of increases in policyholder liabilities
    due to higher than expected mortality on specific blocks of
    business and an increase in litigation liabilities in 2006, the
    unfavorable impact of the reversal of a tax credit in 2006 as
    well as growth of the in-force business.

•

Japan’s income from continuing operations increased due to
    improved hedge results and business growth, partially offset by
    the impact of foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Ireland’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to the utilization of net operating losses for
    which a valuation allowance had been previously established,
    higher investment income, partially offset by higher

start-up

expenses and currency transaction losses.

•

Hong Kong’s income from continuing operations increased due
    to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife
    Fubon and the resulting consolidation of the operation, as well
    as business growth.

•

Chile’s income from continuing operations increased
    primarily due to growth of the in-force business, higher joint
    venture income and higher returns on inflation indexed
    securities, partially offset by higher compensation,
    infrastructure and marketing expenses.

•

Income from continuing operations increased in the United
    Kingdom due to a reduction of claim liabilities resulting from
    an experience review, offset by an unearned premium calculation
    refinement.

•

Australia’s income from continuing operations increased due
    to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and business
    growth.

•

These increases in income from continuing operations were
    partially offset by a decrease in the home office due to higher
    economic capital charges and investment expenses, an increase in
    contingent tax expenses in 2007, as well as higher spending due
    to growth and initiatives, partially offset by the elimination
    of certain intercompany expenses previously charged to the
    International segment, and a tax benefit associated with a 2006
    income tax expense related to a revision of an estimate.

•

India’s income from continuing operations decreased
    primarily due to headcount increases and growth initiatives, as
    well as the impact of valuation allowances established against
    losses in both years.

•

South Korea’s income from continuing operations decreased
    due to a favorable impact in 2006 associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system, as
    well as additional expenses in 2007 associated with growth and
    infrastructure initiatives, partially offset by continued growth
    and lower DAC amortization, both in the variable universal life
    business.

The Auto & Home segment’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to an increase in premiums
    and other revenues, an increase in net investment income, an
    increase in net investment gains and a decrease in other
    expenses. These were partially offset by losses related to
    higher claim frequencies, higher earned exposures, higher losses
    due to severity, an increase in unallocated claims adjusting
    expenses and an increase from a reduction in favorable
    development of 2006 losses, partially offset by a decrease in
    catastrophe losses, which included favorable development of 2006
    catastrophe liabilities, all of which are related to
    policyholder benefits and claims.

Corporate & Other’s income from continuing
    operations increased primarily due to higher net investment
    income, lower net investment losses, lower corporate expenses,
    higher other revenues, integration costs incurred in



2006, and lower legal costs, partially offset by a decrease in
    tax benefits, higher interest expense on debt, higher interest
    on uncertain tax positions, and higher interest credited to
    bankholder deposits.

Revenues
    and Expenses

Premiums,

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by

    ended December 31, 2007 from $28,064 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

The growth in the Institutional segment was primarily due to
    increases in the non-medical health & other and group
    life businesses. The non-medical health & other
    business increased primarily due to growth in the dental,
    disability, AD&D and IDI businesses. Partially offsetting
    these increases is a decrease in the long-term care
    (“LTC”) business, net of a decrease resulting from a
    shift to deposit liability-type contracts in 2007, partially
    offset by growth in the business. The group life business
    increased primarily due to business growth in term life and
    increases in COLI and life insurance sold to postretirement
    benefit plans. These increases in the non-medical
    health & other and group life businesses were
    partially offset by a decrease in the retirement &
    savings business. The decrease in retirement & savings
    was primarily due to a decrease in structured settlement and
    pension closeout premiums, partially offset by an increase
    across several products.

The growth in the Individual segment was primarily due to higher
    fee income from variable life and annuity and investment-type
    products and growth in premiums from other life products,
    partially offset by a decrease in immediate annuity premiums and
    a decline in premiums associated with the Company’s closed
    block business, in line with expectations.

The growth in the International segment was primarily due to the
    following factors:

•

An increase in Mexico’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    due to higher fees and growth in its institutional and universal
    life businesses, a decrease in experience refunds during the
    first quarter of 2007 on Mexico’s institutional business,
    as well as the adverse impact in 2006 of an adjustment for
    experience refunds on Mexico’s institutional business,
    offset by lower fees resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    various one-time revenue items which benefited both the current
    and prior years.

•

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in Hong Kong
    primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest
    in MetLife Fubon and the resulting consolidation of the
    operation as well as business growth.

•

Chile’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher annuity sales, higher institutional
    premiums from its traditional and bank distribution channels,
    and the decrease in 2006 resulting from management’s
    decision not to match aggressive pricing in the marketplace.

•

South Korea’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to higher fees from growth in its guaranteed
    annuity and variable universal life businesses.

•

Brazil’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and business growth.



•

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in Japan due to an
    increase in reinsurance assumed.

•

Australia’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased
    primarily due to growth in the institutional and reinsurance
    business in-force, an increase in retention levels and changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Argentina’s premiums, fees and other revenues increased due
    to higher pension contributions resulting from higher
    participant salaries and a higher salary threshold subject to
    fees and growth in bancassurance, offset by the reduction of
    cost of insurance fees as a result of the new pension system
    reform regulation.

•

Taiwan’s and India’s premiums, fees and other revenues
    increased primarily due to business growth.

These increases in premiums, fees and other revenues were
    partially offset by a decrease in the United Kingdom due to an
    unearned premium calculation refinement, partially offset by
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The growth in the Auto & Home segment was primarily
    due to an increase in premiums related to increased exposures,
    an increase from various voluntary and involuntary programs, and
    an increase resulting from the change in estimate on auto rate
    refunds due to a regulatory examination, as well as an increase
    in other revenues primarily due to slower than anticipated claim
    payments in 2006. These increases were partially offset by a
    reduction in average earned premium per policy, and an increase
    in catastrophe reinsurance costs.

The increase in Corporate & Other was primarily
    related to the resolution of an indemnification claim associated
    with the 2000 acquisition of GALIC, partially offset by an
    adjustment of surrender values on COLI policies.

Net
    Investment Income

Net investment income increased by $1,816 million, or 11%,
    to $18,063 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007 from $16,247 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    Management attributes $1,078 million of this increase to
    growth in the average asset base and $738 million to an
    increase in yields. The increase in net investment income from
    growth in the average asset base was primarily within fixed
    maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate joint ventures
    and other limited partnership interests. The increase in net
    investment income attributable to higher yields was primarily
    due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities, other
    limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds, equity
    securities and improved securities lending results, partially
    offset by lower returns on real estate joint ventures, cash,
    cash equivalents and short-term investments, hedge funds and
    mortgage loans.

Interest
    Margin

Interest margin, which represents the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account
    balances increased in the Institutional and Individual segments
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006.
    Interest earned approximates net investment income on investable
    assets attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related
    to the consolidation of certain separate accounts and other
    minor non-policyholder elements. Interest credited is the amount
    attributed to insurance products, recorded in policyholder
    benefits and claims, and the amount credited to policyholder
    account balances for investment-type products, recorded in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances. Interest
    credited on insurance products reflects the 2007 impact of the
    interest rate assumptions established at issuance or
    acquisition. Interest credited to policyholder account balances
    is subject to contractual terms, including some minimum
    guarantees. This tends to move gradually over time to reflect
    market interest rate movements and may reflect actions by
    management to respond to competitive pressures and, therefore,
    generally does not introduce volatility in expense.

Net
    Investment Gains (Losses)

Net investment losses decreased by $804 million to a loss
    of $578 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from a loss of $1,382 million for the comparable 2006
    period. The decrease in net investment losses was primarily due
    to a reduction of losses on fixed maturity securities resulting
    principally from the 2006 portfolio repositioning in a rising
    interest rate environment, increased gains from asset-based
    foreign currency transactions



due to a decline in the U.S. dollar year over year against
    several major currencies and increased gains on equity
    securities, partially offset by increased losses from the
    mark-to-market on derivatives and reduced gains on real estate
    and real estate joint ventures.

Underwriting

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity or other insurance costs, less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity or
    other insurance-related experience trends, as well as the
    reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business.
    Consequently, results can fluctuate from year to year.
    Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Although lower than comparable period of
    2006, as the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, increased
    to 86.3% from 82.8% for the year ended December 31, 2006.
    Underwriting results were favorable in the non-medical
    health & other, group life and retirement &
    savings businesses in the Institutional segment. Underwriting
    results were unfavorable in the life products in the Individual
    segment.

Other
    Expenses

Other expenses increased by $892 million, or 9%, to
    $10,429 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $9,537 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The Institutional segment contributed to the year over year
    increase primarily due to an increase in non-deferrable
    volume-related and corporate support expenses, higher DAC
    amortization associated with the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in 2007, a charge related to the reimbursement of dental claims
    in 2007, the establishment of a contingent legal liability in
    2007 and the impact of certain revisions in both years. These
    increases were partially offset by a benefit related to a
    reduction of an allowance for doubtful accounts in 2007, the
    impact of a charge for non-deferrable LTC commissions’
    expense, a charge associated with costs related to the sale of
    certain small market record keeping businesses and a charge
    associated with a regulatory settlement, all in 2006.

The Individual segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to higher DAC
    amortization, higher expenses associated with business growth,
    information technology and other general expenses, the impact of
    revisions to certain liabilities, including pension and
    postretirement liabilities and policyholder liabilities in 2006,
    and a write-off of a receivable from one of the Company’s
    joint venture partners in 2007.

The International segment contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to the business growth
    commensurate with the increase in revenues discussed above. It
    was driven by the following factors:

•

Argentina’s other expenses increased primarily due to a
    liability for servicing obligations that was established as a
    result of pension reform, an increase in commissions on
    bancassurance business, an increase in retention incentives
    related to pension reform, and the impact of management’s
    update of DAC assumptions as a result of pension reform and
    growth, partially offset by a lower increase in liabilities due
    to inflation and exchange rate indexing.



•

South Korea’s other expenses increased primarily due to the
    favorable impact in DAC amortization associated with the
    implementation of a more refined reserve valuation system in
    2006, additional expenses associated with growth and
    infrastructure initiatives, as well as business growth and
    higher bank insurance fees, partially offset by a decrease in
    DAC amortization.

•

Mexico’s other expenses increased due to higher expenses
    related to business growth and the favorable impact in 2006 of
    liabilities that were reduced, offset by a decrease in DAC
    amortization resulting from management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits in both
    2007 and 2006 and a decrease in liabilities based on a review of
    outstanding remittances.

•

Other expenses increased in India primarily due to headcount
    increases and growth initiatives, partially offset by the impact
    of management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits.

•

Other expenses increased in Australia primarily due to business
    growth and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Other expenses increased in Chile primarily due to compensation
    costs, infrastructure and marketing programs, and growth
    partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization related to
    inflation indexing.

•

Other expenses increased in Hong Kong due to the acquisition of
    the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Ireland’s other expenses increased due to higher

start-up

costs, as well as foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Brazil’s other expenses increased due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates partially offset by an increase in
    litigation liabilities in 2006.

•

The United Kingdom’s other expenses increased due to
    changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher spending
    on business initiatives partially offset by lower DAC
    amortization resulting from calculation refinements.

•

These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a
    decrease in Taiwan’s other expenses primarily due to a
    one-time increase in DAC amortization in 2006 due to a loss
    recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates related
    to product guarantees coupled with high persistency rates on
    certain blocks of business, an increase in DAC amortization in
    2006 associated with the implementation of a new valuation
    system, as well as one-time expenses in 2006 related to the
    termination of the agency force, and expense reductions
    recognized in 2007 due to the elimination of the agency force.

These increases in other expenses were partially offset by a
    decrease in the Auto & Home segment primarily related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs, partially
    offset by minor changes in a variety of expense categories.

Corporate & Other contributed to the year over year
    increase in other expenses primarily due to higher interest
    expense, higher interest on uncertain tax positions and an
    increase in interest credited to bankholder deposits at MetLife
    Bank, National Association (“MetLife Bank” or
    “MetLife Bank, N.A.”), partially offset by lower
    corporate support expenses, lower costs from reductions of
    MetLife Foundation contributions, integration costs incurred in
    2006 and lower legal costs.

Net
    Income

Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 was
    $1,660 million, or 29% of income from continuing operations
    before provision for income tax, compared with
    $1,016 million, or 26% of such income, for the comparable
    2006 period. The 2007 and 2006 effective tax rates differ from
    the corporate tax rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of
    non-taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in
    low income housing. In addition, the increase in the effective
    rate for FIN 48 liability additions is entirely offset by
    an increase in non-taxable investment income. The 2007 period
    includes a benefit for decrease in international deferred tax
    valuation allowances and the 2006 period included a prior year
    benefit for international taxes. Lastly, the 2006 period
    included benefit for a “provision-to-filed return”
    adjustment regarding non-taxable investment income.



Income from discontinued operations, net of income tax,
    decreased by $3,168 million, or 94%, to $215 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $3,383 million for the comparable 2006 period. The decrease
    in income from discontinued operations was primarily due to a
    gain of $3 billion, net of income tax, on the sale of the
    Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties in
    Manhattan, New York, that was recognized during the year ended
    December 31, 2006. In addition, there was lower net
    investment income and net investment gains (losses) of
    $148 million, net of income tax, from discontinued
    operations related to real estate properties sold or
    held-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2007 as
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2006. Also
    contributing to the decrease was lower income from discontinued
    operations of $23 million, net of income tax, related to
    the sale of MetLife Australia’s annuities and pension
    businesses to a third party in the third quarter of 2007 and
    lower income from discontinued operations of $18 million,
    net of income tax, related to the sale of SSRM resulting from a
    reduction in additional proceeds from the sale received during
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year
    December 31, 2006. This decrease was partially offset by
    higher income of $7 million, net of income tax, from
    discontinued operations related to RGA, which was reclassified
    to discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2008 as a
    result of a tax-free split off. RGA’s income was higher in
    2007, primarily due to an increase in premiums, net of an
    increase in policyholder benefits and claims, due to additional
    in-force business from facultative and automatic treaties and
    renewal premiums on existing blocks of business combined with an
    increase in net investment income, net of interest credited to
    policyholder account balances, due to higher invested assets.
    These increases in RGA’s income were offset by an increase
    in net investment losses resulting from a decline in the
    estimated fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the
    reinsurance of annuity products on a funds withheld basis. Also
    offsetting the decrease was higher income of $14 million,
    net of income tax, from discontinued operations related to Cova,
    which was reclassified to discontinued operations in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 as a result of the Holding Company entering into
    an agreement to sell the wholly-owned subsidiary.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $423 million, or 29%, to $1,859 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $1,436 million for the
    comparable 2007 period.

Included in this increase in income from continuing operations
    was a decrease in net investment losses of $488 million,
    net of income tax. The decrease in net investment losses was
    primarily due to an increase in gains on derivatives partially
    offset by an increase in losses from fixed maturity and equity
    securities, including losses resulting from intersegment
    transfers of securities. The derivative gains increased by
    $1,572 million, net of income tax, and were primarily
    driven by interest rate swaps, swaptions, and financial futures
    which were economic hedges of certain investment assets and
    institutional liabilities. The remaining change in net
    investment losses of $1,084 million, net of income tax, is
    principally attributable to an increase in losses on fixed
    maturity and equity securities, and, to a lesser degree, an
    increase in losses on mortgage and consumer loans and other
    limited partnership interests offset by an increase in foreign
    currency transaction gains. The increase in losses on fixed
    maturity and equity securities is primarily attributable to
    losses on intersegment transfers of approximately
    $650 million, net of income tax, which are eliminated
    within Corporate & Other and to an increase in
    impairments associated with financial services industry holdings
    which experienced losses as a result of bankruptcies, FDIC
    receivership, and federal government assisted capital infusion
    transactions in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, as well
    as other credit related impairments or losses on fixed maturity
    securities where the Company did not intend to hold the
    securities until recovery in conjunction with overall market
    declines occurring throughout the year.

The increase in net investment losses decreased policyholder
    benefits and claims by $83 million, net of income tax, the
    majority of which relates to policyholder participation in the
    performance of the portfolio.

Excluding the impact from net investment gains (losses), income
    from continuing operations decreased by $148 million, net
    of income tax, compared to the prior year.

Lower underwriting results of $155 million, net of income
    tax, compared to the prior year, contributed to the decrease in
    income from continuing operations. Management attributed this
    decrease primarily to the group life, non-medical health &
    other and retirement & savings businesses of
    $61 million, $50 million and $47 million, all net
    of income tax, respectively. Underwriting results are generally
    the difference between the portion of premium and fee income
    intended to cover mortality, morbidity, or other insurance costs
    less claims incurred, and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends, as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain
    blocks of business. During periods of high unemployment,
    underwriting results, specifically in the disability businesses,
    tend to decrease as incidence levels trend upwards with
    unemployment levels and the amount of recoveries decline. In
    addition, certain insurance-related liabilities can vary as a
    result of the valuation of the assets supporting those
    liabilities. As invested assets under perform or lose value, the
    related insurance liabilities are increased to reflect the
    company’s obligation with respect to those products,
    specifically certain LTC products. Consequently, underwriting
    results can and will fluctuate from period to period.

In addition, a decrease in interest margins of
    $127 million, net of income tax, compared to the prior
    year, contributed to the decrease in income from continuing
    operations. Management attributed this decrease to the
    retirement & savings and non-medical
    health & other businesses, which contributed
    $144 million and $71 million, net of income tax,
    respectively. Partially offsetting these decreases was an
    increase in the group life business of $88 million, net of
    income tax. The decrease in interest margin is primarily
    attributable to a decline in net investment income due to lower
    returns on other limited partnership interests, real estate
    joint ventures, fixed maturity securities, other invested assets
    including derivatives, and mortgage loans, partially offset by
    improved securities lending results. Management anticipates that
    net investment income and the related yields on other limited
    partnerships and real estate joint ventures could decline
    further, which may reduce net investment income during the
    remainder of 2009 due to continued volatility in equity, real
    estate, and credit markets and therefore may continue to reduce
    interest margins during 2009. Interest margin is the difference
    between interest earned and interest credited to policyholder
    account balances. Interest earned approximates net investment
    income on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor
    adjustments related to the consolidation of certain



separate accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements.
    Interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance
    products, recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the
    amount credited to policyholder account balances for
    investment-type products, recorded in interest credited to
    policyholder account balances. Interest credited on insurance
    products reflects the current period impact of the interest rate
    assumptions established at issuance or acquisition. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees. This tends
    to move in a manner similar to market interest rate movements,
    and may reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures and, therefore, generally does not, but it may,
    introduce volatility in expense.

Partially offsetting these decreases in income from continuing
    operations was a decline in other expenses, due in part to lower
    expenses related to DAC amortization of $65 million, net of
    income tax, primarily due to the impact of a charge of
    $40 million, net of income tax, in the prior year, due to
    the impact of the implementation of

SOP 05-1

and a decrease of $12 million, net of income tax, mainly
    from amortization refinements in the current year. Partially
    offsetting the decline in DAC amortization was the net impact of
    revisions to certain assets and liabilities in the prior and
    current year of $19 million, net of income tax. The
    remaining increase in operating expenses was more than offset by
    the remaining increase in premiums, fees, and other revenues. A
    portion of premiums, fees and other revenues is intended to
    cover the Company’s operating expenses or non-insurance
    related expenses. As many of those expenses are fixed expenses,
    management may not be able to reduce those expenses, in a timely
    manner, proportionate with declining revenues that may result
    from customer-related bankruptcies, customer’s reduction of
    coverage stemming from plan changes, elimination of retiree
    coverage, or a reduction in covered payroll.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $2,064 million, or 9%, to $24,160 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $22,096 million for the comparable 2007 period.

The increase of $2,705 million in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was largely due to increases in the
    retirement & savings, non-medical health &
    other and group life businesses of $1,451 million,
    $749 million and $505 million, respectively.

An increase in the retirement & savings business was
    primarily due to increases in premiums in the group
    institutional annuity, structured settlement and global GIC
    businesses of $1,310 million, $222 million and
    $42 million, respectively. The increase in both group
    institutional annuity and the structured settlement businesses
    were primarily due to higher sales. The increase in the group
    institutional annuity business was primarily due to large
    domestic sales and the first significant sales in the United
    Kingdom business in the current year. The global GIC related
    increase was primarily the result of fees earned on the
    surrender of a GIC contract. Partially offsetting these
    increases was the impact of lower sales in the income annuity
    business of $108 million. The remaining increase in the
    retirement & savings business was attributed to
    business growth across several products. Premiums, fees and
    other revenues from retirement & savings products are
    significantly influenced by large transactions and the demand
    for certain of these products can decline during periods of
    volatile credit and investment markets and, as a result, can
    fluctuate from period to period.

The growth in the non-medical health & other business
    was largely due to increases in the dental, disability,
    AD&D, and IDI businesses of $734 million. The increase
    in the dental business was primarily due to organic growth in
    the business and the impact of an acquisition that closed in the
    first quarter of 2008. The increases in the disability,
    AD&D, and IDI businesses were primarily due to continued
    growth in the business. Partially offsetting these increases was
    a decline in the LTC business of $5 million, primarily
    attributable to a $74 million decrease, which management
    attributed to a shift to deposit liability-type contracts during
    the latter part of the prior year. This decline in the LTC
    business was almost completely offset by current year growth in
    the business. The remaining increase in the non-medical
    health & other business was attributed to business
    growth across several products.

The increase in group life business of $505 million was
    primarily due to a $443 million increase in term life,
    which was largely attributable to business growth, partially
    offset by a decrease in assumed reinsurance. COLI and universal
    life products increased $47 million and $37 million,
    respectively. The increase in COLI was largely attributable to
    the impact of fees earned on the cancellation of a portion of a
    stable value wrap contract of $44 million. In addition,
    continued business growth and the impact of higher experience
    rated refunds in the prior



year contributed to this increase. Partially offsetting these
    increases in COLI was the impact of fees earned on a large sale
    in the prior year. The increase in universal life products was
    primarily attributable to business growth in the current year.
    Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in life
    insurance sold to postretirement benefit plans of
    $21 million, primarily the result of the impact of a large
    sale in the prior year. Premiums, fees and other revenues from
    group life business can and will fluctuate based, in part, on
    the covered payroll of customers. In periods of high
    unemployment, revenue may be impacted. Revenue may also be
    impacted as a result of customer-related bankruptcies,
    customer’s reduction of coverage stemming from plan changes
    or elimination of retiree coverage.

Partially offsetting the increase in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was a decrease in net investment income of
    $641 million. Management attributed a $1,246 million
    decrease in net investment income to a decrease in yields,
    primarily due to lower returns on other limited partnership
    interests, real estate joint ventures, fixed maturity
    securities, other invested assets including derivatives, and
    mortgage loans, partially offset by improved securities lending
    results. Management anticipates that net investment income and
    the related yields on other limited partnership interests and
    real estate joint ventures could decline further, which may
    reduce net investment income during 2009 due to continued
    volatility in equity, real estate, and credit markets. Partially
    offsetting this decrease in yields was a $605 million
    increase, attributed to growth in average invested assets
    calculated on a cost basis without unrealized gains and losses,
    primarily within mortgage loans, other limited partnership
    interests, other invested assets including derivatives, and real
    estate joint ventures.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $2,176 million, or 11%, to
    $21,514 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $19,338 million for the comparable 2007 period. The
    increase in expenses was primarily attributable to policyholder
    benefits and claims of $2,720 million, partially offset by
    lower interest credited to policyholder account balances of
    $513 million and lower other expenses of $31 million.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $2,720 million included a $128 million decrease
    related to net investment gains (losses). Excluding the decrease
    related to net investment gains (losses), policyholder benefits
    and claims increased by $2,848 million.

Retirement & savings’ policyholder benefits
    increased $1,616 million, which was primarily attributable
    to the group institutional annuity and structured settlement
    businesses of $1,448 million and $261 million,
    respectively. The increase in the group institutional annuity
    business was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in
    premiums and charges of $112 million in the current year
    due to liability adjustments in this block of business. In
    addition, an increase in interest credited on future
    policyholder benefits contributed to this increase, which is
    consistent with the expectations of an aging block of business.
    The increase in structured settlements was largely due to the
    aforementioned increase in premiums, an increase in interest
    credited on future policyholder benefits and the impact of a
    favorable liability refinement in the prior year of
    $12 million, partially offset by slightly more favorable
    mortality in the current year. Partially offsetting these
    increases was a decrease of $90 million in the income
    annuity business, primarily attributable to the aforementioned
    decrease in premiums, fees and other revenues, partially offset
    by an increase in interest credited to future policyholder
    benefits.

Non-medical health & other’s policyholder
    benefits and claims increased by $736 million. An increase
    of $650 million was largely due to the aforementioned
    growth in the dental, disability, AD&D and IDI businesses.
    The increase in the disability business was primarily driven by
    higher incidence and lower recoveries in the current year. In
    addition, LTC increased $87 million, which was primarily
    attributable to continued business growth, the impact of a
    separate account reserve strengthening, triggered by weaker
    investment performance in the current year and an increase in
    interest credited on future policyholder benefits. These
    increases were partially offset by the aforementioned
    $74 million shift to deposit liability-type contracts.
    Included in the disability increase was the favorable impact of
    a $14 million charge related to certain liability
    refinements in the prior year.

Group life’s policyholder benefits and claims increased
    $496 million, mostly due to increases in the term life,
    universal life and COLI products of $429 million,
    $71 million and $22 million, respectively, partially
    offset by a decrease of $26 million in life insurance sold
    to postretirement benefit plans. The increases in term life and
    universal life were primarily due to the aforementioned increase
    in premiums, fees and other revenues and included



the impact of less favorable mortality experience in the current
    year. The current year mortality experience was negatively
    impacted by an unusually high number of large claims in the
    specialty product areas. An additional component of the term
    life increase was the impact of prior year net favorable
    liability refinements of $12 million. Partially offsetting
    these increases in term life was a decrease in interest credited
    on future policyholder benefits, mainly due to lower crediting
    rates in the current year. The increase in the COLI business was
    primarily due to the aforementioned growth in fee income,
    partially offset by favorable mortality in the current year. The
    decrease in life insurance sold to postretirement benefit plans
    was primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in premiums and
    more favorable mortality in the current year.

Management attributed the decrease of $513 million in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances to a
    $856 million decrease from a decline in average crediting
    rates, which was largely due to the impact of lower short-term
    interest rates in the current year, partially offset by a
    $343 million increase, solely from growth in the average
    policyholder account balances, primarily the result of continued
    growth in the global GIC and FHLB advances, partially offset by
    a decline in funding agreement issuances. Management attributes
    the absence of funding agreement issuances in 2008 as a direct
    result of the credit markets. Management believes this trend
    will continue through the remainder of 2009.

Lower other expenses of $31 million included a decrease in
    DAC amortization of $101 million, primarily due to a
    $61 million charge associated with the impact of DAC and
    VOBA amortization, from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in the prior year and an $18 million decrease mainly due to
    the impact of amortization refinements in the current year. In
    addition, the impact of a charge of $14 million relating to
    the reimbursement of certain dental claims and a
    $15 million charge related to the establishment of a
    liability, both in the prior year, contributed to the decrease
    in other expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases were
    non-deferrable volume related expenses and corporate support
    expenses, which increased $40 million. Non-deferrable
    volume related expenses include those expenses associated with
    information technology, compensation, and direct departmental
    spending. Direct departmental spending includes expenses
    associated with advertising, consultants, travel, printing and
    postage. Also contributing to the increase was a
    $29 million charge due to the impact of revisions to
    certain pension and postretirement liabilities in the current
    year, a $17 million expense resulting from fees incurred
    related to the cancellation of a portion of a stable value wrap
    contract, and a $13 million unfavorable impact related to a
    prior year reduction of an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared with the year ended
    December 31, 2006 — Institutional

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased $317 million,
    or 28%, to $1,436 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 from $1,119 million for the
    comparable 2006 period.

Included in this increase are higher earnings of
    $31 million, net of income tax, from lower net investment
    losses. In addition, higher earnings of $11 million, net of
    income tax, resulted from an increase in policyholder benefits
    and claims related to net investment gains (losses). Excluding
    the impact of net investment gains (losses), income from
    continuing operations increased by $275 million, net of
    income tax, as compared to 2006.

Interest margins increased $230 million, net of income tax,
    as compared to 2006. Management attributes this increase to a
    $147 million increase in retirement & savings, a
    $46 million increase in group life and a $37 million
    increase in non-medical health & other, respectively, all
    net of income tax. Interest margin is the difference between
    interest earned and interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. Interest earned approximates net investment income on
    investable assets attributed to the segment with minor
    adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate
    accounts and other minor non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited is the amount attributed to insurance products,
    recorded in policyholder benefits and claims, and the amount
    credited to policyholder account balances for investment-type
    products, recorded in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances. Interest credited on insurance products reflects the
    2007 impact of the interest rate assumptions established at
    issuance or acquisition. Interest credited to policyholder
    account balances is subject to contractual terms, including some
    minimum guarantees. This tends to move gradually over time to
    reflect market interest rate movements, and may reflect actions
    by management to respond to competitive pressures and,
    therefore, generally does not introduce volatility in expense.



An increase in underwriting results of $90 million, net of
    income tax, as compared to 2006, contributed to the increase in
    income from continuing operations. Management attributes this
    increase primarily to the non-medical health & other,
    group life and retirement & savings businesses with
    increases of $66 million, $16 million and
    $8 million, all net of income tax, respectively.

Underwriting results are generally the difference between the
    portion of premium and fee income intended to cover mortality,
    morbidity, or other insurance costs less claims incurred, and
    the change in insurance-related liabilities. Underwriting
    results are significantly influenced by mortality, morbidity, or
    other insurance-related experience trends, as well as the
    reinsurance activity related to certain blocks of business.
    Consequently, results can fluctuate from period to period.

Partially offsetting this increase in income from continuing
    operations were higher expenses related to an increase in
    non-deferrable volume-related expenses and corporate support
    expenses of $72 million, net of income tax, as well as an
    increase in DAC amortization of $44 million, net of income
    tax, primarily due to a charge of $40 million, net of
    income tax, due to the ongoing impact on DAC and VOBA
    amortization resulting from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in 2007. This increase in expense was partially offset by the
    impact of certain revisions in both years for a net decrease of
    $34 million, net of income tax. The remaining increase in
    operating expenses was more than offset by the remaining
    increase in premiums, fees, and other revenues.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $1,510 million, or 7%, to $22,096 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $20,586 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Net investment income increased by $916 million.
    Management attributes $744 million of this increase to
    growth in the average asset base primarily within mortgage loans
    on real estate, fixed maturity securities, real estate joint
    ventures, other limited partnership interests, and equity
    securities, driven by continued business growth, particularly
    growth in the funding agreements and global GIC businesses.
    Additionally, management attributes $172 million of this
    increase in net investment income to an increase in yields,
    primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities,
    improved securities lending results, other limited partnership
    interests, and equity securities, partially offset by a decline
    in yields on real estate and real estate joint ventures and
    mortgage loans.

The increase of $594 million in premiums, fees and other
    revenues was largely due to increases in the non-medical
    health & other business of $483 million,
    primarily due to growth in the dental, disability, AD&D and
    IDI businesses of $478 million. Partially offsetting these
    increases in the non-medical health & other business
    is a decline in the LTC business of $7 million, which
    includes a $66 million decrease resulting from a shift to
    deposit liability-type contracts in 2007. Excluding this shift,
    LTC premiums would have increased due to growth in the business.
    Group life increased $345 million, which management
    primarily attributes to a $262 million increase in term
    life, primarily due to growth in the business from new sales and
    an increase in reinsurance assumed, partially offset by the
    impact of an increase in experience rated refunds. In addition,
    COLI and life insurance sold to postretirement benefit plans
    increased by $65 million and $30 million,
    respectively. The increase in COLI is largely attributable to
    fees earned on a large sale in 2007. These increases in group
    life’s premiums, fees and other revenues were partially
    offset by a decrease of $5 million in the universal life
    insurance products. Partially offsetting the increase in
    premiums, fees and other revenues was a decline in
    retirement & savings’ premiums, fees and other
    revenues of $234 million, primarily from declines of
    $158 million and $79 million in structured settlement
    and pension closeout premiums, respectively, partially offset by
    an increase of $3 million across several products. The
    declines in the structured settlement and pension closeout
    businesses are predominantly due to the impact of lower sales in
    2007. Premiums, fees and other revenues from
    retirement & savings products are significantly
    influenced by large transactions and, as a result, can fluctuate
    from period to period.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,064 million, or 6%, to
    $19,338 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $18,274 million for the comparable 2006 period.



The increase in expenses was attributable to higher interest
    credited to policyholder account balances of $501 million,
    higher policyholder benefits and claims of $437 million and
    an increase in operating expenses of $126 million.

Management attributes the increase of $501 million in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances to a
    $352 million increase solely from growth in the average
    policyholder account balances, primarily resulting from growth
    in global GICs and funding agreements within the
    retirement & savings business and a $149 million
    increase from a rise in average crediting rates, largely due to
    the global GIC program, coupled with a rise in short-term
    interest rates in 2007.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $437 million included a $16 million decrease related
    to net investment gains (losses). Excluding the decrease related
    to net investment gains (losses), policyholder benefits and
    claims increased by $453 million. Non-medical
    health & other’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $383 million. This increase was largely due to
    a $369 million increase in the dental, disability, IDI and
    AD&D businesses, resulting from the aforementioned growth
    in business. This increase was partially offset by favorable
    claim experience in the dental business and favorable morbidity
    experience in the disability, IDI and AD&D businesses. This
    increase included charges related to certain refinements of
    $14 million in 2007 in LTD and the impact of a
    $22 million disability liability reduction in 2006, which
    contributed to the increase. An increase in LTC of
    $14 million is largely attributable to business growth and
    an increase in interest credited, partially offset by the
    aforementioned $66 million shift to deposit liability-type
    contracts and the impact of more favorable claim experience in
    2007. Group life’s policyholder benefits and claims
    increased by $264 million due mostly to an increase in the
    term life business of $245 million, which included the
    impact of less favorable mortality in the term life product,
    partially offset by the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements of $12 million in 2007. An increase of
    $29 million in life insurance sold to postretirement plans
    and $25 million for other group life products, including
    COLI, also contributed to the increase in policyholder benefits
    and claims for group life. The increases in term life and life
    insurance sold to postretirement benefit plans are commensurate
    with the aforementioned premiums increases. These increases were
    partially offset by a decline in universal group life products
    of $36 million, primarily due to favorable claim
    experience. Retirement & savings’ policyholder
    benefits decreased by $194 million, which was largely due
    to decreases in the pension closeout and structured settlement
    businesses of $98 million and $97 million,
    respectively. The decrease in pension closeouts was primarily
    due to the aforementioned decrease in premiums and a decrease in
    interest credited. The decline in structured settlements was
    primarily a result of the aforementioned decline in premiums,
    partially offset by an increase in interest credited and less
    favorable mortality experience in 2007. In addition, this
    decrease included the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements in 2007, which contributed a decrease of
    $20 million, and the net impact of favorable liability
    refinements in 2006 of $57 million, largely related to
    business associated with the acquisition of Travelers,
    principally in the structured settlement, pension closeout and
    general account businesses.

Higher other expenses of $126 million included an increase
    in non-deferrable volume-related expenses and corporate support
    expenses of $110 million. Non-deferrable volume-related
    expenses included those expenses associated with direct
    departmental spending, information technology, commissions and
    premium taxes. Corporate support expenses included advertising,
    corporate overhead and consulting fees. The increase in other
    expenses was also attributable to higher DAC amortization of
    $67 million, primarily due to a $61 million charge as
    a result of the ongoing impact of DAC and VOBA amortization
    resulting from the implementation of

SOP 05-1

in 2007. In addition, a charge of $14 million related to
    the reimbursement of certain dental claims and a
    $15 million charge related to the establishment of a
    contingent legal liability in 2007 contributed to the increase
    in other expenses. The impact of certain revisions in both years
    also contributed to a net increase in other expenses of
    $2 million. These increases were partially offset by a
    $13 million benefit related to a reduction of an allowance
    for doubtful accounts in 2007. Additionally, 2006 included the
    impact of a $22 million charge for non-deferrable LTC
    commissions expense, a charge of $24 million associated
    with costs related to the sale of certain small market
    recordkeeping businesses and $24 million related to a
    regulatory settlement, which reduced other expenses in 2007.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased by
    $711 million, or 53%, to $630 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $1,341 million for the
    prior year.

Included in this decrease in income from continuing operations
    was a decrease in net investment losses of $505 million,
    net of income tax. The decrease in net investment losses is due
    to an increase in gains on derivatives partially offset by
    losses primarily on fixed maturity securities, including losses
    resulting from intersegment transfers of securities. Derivative
    gains were driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were
    partially offset by losses on embedded derivatives primarily
    associated with variable annuity riders. Gains on freestanding
    derivatives increased by $2,308 million, net of income tax,
    and were primarily driven by: i) gains on certain interest
    rate floors and financial futures which were economic hedges of
    certain investment assets and liabilities, ii) gains from
    foreign currency derivatives primarily due to the
    U.S. dollar strengthening as well as, iii) gains
    primarily from equity options, financial futures, and interest
    rate swaps hedging the embedded derivatives. The gains on these
    equity options, financial futures, and interest rate swaps
    substantially offset the change in the underlying embedded
    derivative liability that is hedged by these derivatives. Losses
    on the embedded derivatives increased by $1,023 million,
    net of income tax, and were driven by declining interest rates
    and poor equity market performance throughout the year. These
    embedded derivative losses include an $870 million, net of
    income tax, gain resulting from the effect of the widening of
    the Company’s own credit spread which is required to be
    used in the valuation of these variable annuity rider embedded
    derivatives under SFAS 157, which became effective
    January 1, 2008. The remaining change in net investment
    losses of $780 million, net of income tax, is principally
    attributable to an increase in losses on fixed maturity
    securities and, to a lesser degree, an increase in foreign



currency transaction losses on mortgage loans. The increase in
    losses on fixed maturity securities is primarily attributable to
    losses on intersegment transfers of approximately
    $350 million, net of income tax, which are eliminated
    within Corporate & Other and to impairments associated
    with financial services industry holdings which experienced
    losses as a result of bankruptcies, FDIC receivership, and
    federal government assisted capital infusion transactions in the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008, as well as other credit
    related impairments or losses on fixed maturity securities where
    the Company did not intend to hold the securities until recovery
    in conjunction with overall market declines occurring throughout
    the year.

Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses), income
    from continuing operations decreased by $1,216 million, net
    of income tax, from the prior year.

The decrease in income from continuing operations for the year
    was driven by the following items:

•

Higher DAC amortization of $837 million, net of income tax,
    related to lower expected future gross profits due to separate
    account balance decreases resulting from recent market declines,
    higher net investment gains primarily due to net derivative
    gains and the reduction in expected cumulative earnings of the
    closed block partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings
    of the closed block and changes in assumptions used to estimate
    future gross profits and margins.

•

A decrease in interest margins of $318 million, net of
    income tax. Interest margins relate primarily to the general
    account portion of investment-type products. Management
    attributed a $279 million decrease to the deferred annuity
    business and a $39 million decrease to other
    investment-type products, both net of income tax. The decrease
    in interest margin was primarily attributable to a decline in
    net investment income due to lower returns on other limited
    partnership interests, real estate joint ventures, other
    invested assets including derivatives, and short term
    investments, all of which were partially offset by higher
    securities lending results. Interest margin is the difference
    between interest earned and interest credited to policyholder
    account balances related to the general account on these
    businesses. Interest earned approximates net investment income
    on invested assets attributed to these businesses with net
    adjustments for other non-policyholder elements. Interest
    credited approximates the amount recorded in interest credited
    to policyholder account balances. Interest credited to
    policyholder account balances is subject to contractual terms,
    including some minimum guarantees, and may reflect actions by
    management to respond to competitive pressures. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances tends to move in a
    manner similar to market interest rate movements, subject to any
    minimum guarantees and, therefore, generally does not, but it
    may introduce volatility in expense.

•

Unfavorable underwriting results in life products of
    $68 million, net of income tax. Underwriting results are
    generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee
    income intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance
    costs less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends, as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain
    blocks of business. Consequently, results can fluctuate from
    year to year.

•

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances of $39 million, net of income tax, due primarily
    to lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on
    acquired annuity and universal life blocks of business.

•

Higher annuity benefits of $29 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to higher guaranteed annuity benefit costs net of
    related hedging results and higher amortization of sales
    inducements, partially offset by revisions to policyholder
    benefits in both years.

•

Lower universal life and investment-type product policy fees
    combined with other revenues of $22 million, net of income
    tax, primarily resulting from lower average separate account
    balances due to unfavorable equity market performance during the
    current year, as well as revisions to management’s
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins. These decreases were partially offset by universal life
    business growth over the prior year.

•

An increase in policyholder dividends of $16 million, net
    of income tax, due to growth in the business.



These aforementioned decreases in income from continuing
    operations were partially offset by the following items:

•

Lower expenses of $96 million, net of income tax, primarily
    due to a decrease in non-deferrable volume related expenses and
    a write-off of a receivable from one of the Company’s joint
    venture partners in the prior year, partially offset by the
    impact of revisions to certain pension and post retirement
    liabilities in the current year.

•

Higher net investment income on blocks of business not driven by
    interest margins of $12 million, net of income tax.

The change in effective tax rates between years accounts for the
    remainder of the increase in income from continuing operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $586 million, or 4%, to $14,961 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $15,547 million for the prior year.

Premiums remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the prior year. Premiums were impacted by an
    increase in immediate annuity premiums of $23 million and
    growth in premiums from other life products of $60 million
    driven by increased renewals of traditional life business. These
    increases were completely offset by an $83 million decline
    in premiums associated with the Company’s closed block of
    business in line with expectations.

Universal life and investment-type product policy fees combined
    with other revenues decreased by $70 million primarily
    resulting from lower average separate account balances due to
    unfavorable equity market performance during the current year,
    as well as revisions to management’s assumptions used to
    determine estimated gross profits and margins. These decreases
    were partially offset by universal life business growth over the
    prior year. Policy fees from variable life and annuity and
    investment-type products are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts. The
    value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity
    performance.

Net investment income decreased by $516 million. Net
    investment income from the general account portion of
    investment-type products decreased by $499 million, while
    other businesses decreased by $17 million. Management
    attributed $566 million of the decrease to a decrease in
    yields, primarily due to lower returns on other limited
    partnership interests, real estate joint ventures, other
    invested assets including derivatives, and short term
    investments, all of which were partially offset by higher
    securities lending results. Management attributed a
    $50 million increase to a higher average asset base across
    various investment types. Average invested assets are calculated
    on cost basis without unrealized gains and losses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $1,293 million, or 10%, to
    $14,689 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $13,396 million for the prior year.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $114 million.
    This was primarily due to unfavorable equity market performance
    during the current year, which resulted in higher guaranteed
    annuity benefit costs net of related hedging results of
    $113 million and higher amortization of sales inducements
    of $69 million. These increases were partially offset by
    $137 million of revisions to policyholder benefits in the
    current year. Additionally, unfavorable mortality in the life
    products, including the closed block, contributed
    $69 million to this increase.

Interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $15 million. Interest credited on the general account
    portion of investment-type products decreased by
    $40 million, while other businesses decreased by
    $5 million. Of the $40 million decrease on the general
    account portion of investment-type products, management
    attributed $68 million to lower crediting rates partially
    offset by a $28 million increase due to higher average
    general account balances. More than offsetting these decreases
    was lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on
    acquired annuity and universal life blocks of business of
    $60 million primarily driven by lower lapses in the current
    year.



Policyholder dividends increased by $24 million due to
    growth in the business.

Higher other expenses of $1,140 million include higher DAC
    amortization of $1,287 million primarily relating to lower
    expected future gross profits due to separate account balance
    decreases resulting from recent market declines, higher net
    investment gains primarily due to net derivative gains and the
    reduction in expected cumulative earnings of the closed block
    partially offset by a reduction in actual earnings of the closed
    block and changes in assumptions used to estimate future gross
    profits and margins. This was offset by a decrease in other
    expenses of $147 million driven by a $149 million
    decrease in non-deferrable volume related expenses, which
    include those expenses associated with information technology,
    compensation and direct departmental spending. Direct
    departmental spending includes expenses associated with
    consultants, travel, printing and postage. Additionally, there
    was a decrease due to a $24 million write-off of a
    receivable from one of the Company’s joint venture partners
    in the prior year. Partially offsetting these decreases was an
    increase of $26 million due to the impact of revisions to
    certain pension and post retirement liabilities in the current
    year.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006 — Individual

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by $99 million,
    or 8%, to $1,341 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 from $1,242 million for the
    comparable period in 2006. Included in this increase was a
    decrease in net investment losses of $311 million, net of
    income tax. Excluding the impact of net investment gains
    (losses), income from continuing operations decreased by
    $212 million from 2006.

The decrease in income from continuing operations for the year
    was driven by the following items:

•

Higher DAC amortization of $205 million, net of income tax,
    primarily resulting from business growth, lower net investment
    losses in 2007 and revisions to management’s assumptions
    used to determine estimated gross profits and margins.

•

Unfavorable underwriting results in life products of
    $151 million, net of income tax. Underwriting results are
    generally the difference between the portion of premium and fee
    income intended to cover mortality, morbidity or other insurance
    costs less claims incurred and the change in insurance-related
    liabilities. Underwriting results are significantly influenced
    by mortality, morbidity, or other insurance-related experience
    trends, as well as the reinsurance activity related to certain
    blocks of business. Consequently, results can fluctuate from
    year to year.

•

Higher expenses of $132 million, net of income tax. Higher
    general expenses, the impact of revisions to certain liabilities
    in both years, and the write-off of a receivable from one of the
    Company’s joint venture partners contributed to the
    increase in other expenses.

•

An increase in the closed block-related policyholder dividend
    obligation of $75 million, net of income tax, which was
    driven by net investment gains.

•

Higher annuity benefits of $24 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to higher amortization of deferred costs,
    partially offset by lower costs of guaranteed annuity benefit
    riders and related hedging.

•

An increase in policyholder dividends of $12 million, net
    of income tax, due to growth in the business.

•

An increase in interest credited to policyholder account
    balances of $13 million, net of income tax, due primarily
    to lower amortization of the excess interest reserves on
    acquired annuity and universal life blocks of business.

These aforementioned decreases in income from continuing
    operations were partially offset by the following items:

•

Higher fee income from separate account products of
    $276 million, net of income tax, primarily related to fees
    being earned on a higher average account balance resulting from
    a combination of growth in the business and overall market
    performance.



•

Higher net investment income on blocks of business not driven by
    interest margins of $99 million, net of income tax, due to
    an increase in yields and growth in the average asset base.

•

An increase in interest margins of $18 million, net of
    income tax. Interest margins relate primarily to the general
    account portion of investment-type products. Management
    attributed a $1 million decrease to the deferred annuity
    business offset by a $19 million increase to other
    investment-type products, both net of income tax. Interest
    margin is the difference between interest earned and interest
    credited to policyholder account balances related to the general
    account on these businesses. Interest earned approximates net
    investment income on invested assets attributed to these
    businesses with net adjustments for other non-policyholder
    elements. Interest credited approximates the amount recorded in
    interest credited to policyholder account balances. Interest
    credited to policyholder account balances is subject to
    contractual terms, including some minimum guarantees, and may
    reflect actions by management to respond to competitive
    pressures. Interest credited to policyholder account balances
    tends to move in a manner similar to market interest rate
    movements, and may reflect actions by management to respond to
    competitive pressures and, therefore, generally does not, but it
    may, introduce volatility in expense.

The change in effective tax rates between years accounts for the
    remainder of the decrease in income from continuing operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $527 million, or 4%, to $15,547 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $15,020 million for 2006.

Premiums decreased by $21 million due to a decrease in
    immediate annuity premiums of $27 million, and an
    $89 million decline in premiums associated with the
    Company’s closed block of business, in line with
    expectations. These decreases were partially offset by growth in
    premiums from other life products of $95 million, primarily
    driven by increased sales of term life business.

Universal life and investment-type product policy fees combined
    with other revenues increased by $386 million due to a
    combination of growth in the business and improved overall
    market performance, as well as revisions to management’s
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits and
    margins. Policy fees from variable life and annuity and
    investment-type products are typically calculated as a
    percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts. The
    value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity
    performance.

Net investment income increased by $162 million. Net
    investment income from the general account portion of
    investment-type products and other businesses increased by
    $47 million and $115 million, respectively. Management
    attributes $109 million of this increase to an increase in
    yields, primarily due to higher returns on other limited
    partnership interests. Additionally, management attributes
    $53 million to growth in the average asset base across
    various investment types.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $862 million, or 7%, to
    $13,396 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $12,534 million for 2006.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $330 million
    primarily due to an increase in the closed block-related
    policyholder dividend obligation of $115 million which was
    primarily driven by net investment gains. Unfavorable mortality
    in the life products, as well as revisions to policyholder
    benefits in both years, contributed $199 million to this
    increase. Included in this increase was $72 million of
    unfavorable mortality in the closed block and a prior year net
    increase of $15 million in the excess mortality liability
    on specific blocks of life insurance policies. Higher
    amortization of sales inducements resulting from business growth
    and revisions to management’s assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits and margins, partially offset by lower
    costs of guaranteed annuity benefit riders and related hedging
    increased annuity benefits by $37 million. Partially
    offsetting these increases, policyholder benefits and claims
    decreased by $21 million commensurate with the decrease in
    premiums discussed above.



Interest credited to policyholder account balances decreased by
    $5 million. Interest credited on the general account
    portion of investment-type products and other businesses
    decreased by $16 million and $9 million, respectively.
    Of the $16 million decrease on the general account portion
    of investment-type products, management attributed
    $67 million to higher crediting rates, more than offset by
    $83 million due to lower average policyholder account
    balances. Partially offsetting these decreases was lower
    amortization of the excess interest reserves on acquired annuity
    and universal life blocks of business of $20 million
    primarily driven by lower lapses in 2007.

Policyholder dividends increased by $19 million due to
    growth in the business.

Higher other expenses of $518 million include higher DAC
    amortization of $315 million resulting from business
    growth, lower net investment losses and revisions to
    management’s assumptions used to determine estimated gross
    profits and margins. The remaining increase in other expenses of
    $203 million was comprised of $172 million associated
    with business growth, information technology and other general
    expenses, $7 million due to the impact of revisions to
    certain liabilities including pension and postretirement
    liabilities and policyholder liabilities in 2006, and
    $24 million associated with the write-off of a receivable
    from one of the Company’s joint venture partners in 2007.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased by $64 million,
    or 10%, to $580 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 from $644 million for the prior year.



Included in this decrease in income from continuing operations
    was an increase in net investment gains of $39 million, net
    of income tax. The increase in net investment gains was due to
    an increase in gains on derivatives partially offset by losses
    primarily on fixed maturity and equity securities. Derivative
    gains were driven by gains on freestanding derivatives that were
    partially offset by losses on embedded derivatives associated
    with assumed risk on variable annuity riders written directly
    through the Japan joint venture. Gains on freestanding
    derivatives increased by $644 million, net of income tax,
    and were primarily driven by gains from equity options,
    financial futures, interest rate swaps, and foreign currency
    forwards hedging the embedded derivatives. The gains on these
    equity options, financial futures, interest rate swaps, and
    foreign currency forwards substantially offset the change in the
    underlying embedded derivative liability that is hedged by these
    derivatives. Losses on the embedded derivatives increased by
    $532 million, net of income tax, and were driven by
    declining interest rates, poor equity market performance, and
    foreign currency fluctuations throughout the year. These
    embedded derivative losses include a $1,076 million, net of
    income tax, gain resulting from the effect of the widening of
    the Company’s own credit spread which is required to be
    used in the valuation of these variable annuity rider embedded
    derivatives under SFAS 157, which became effective
    January 1, 2008. The remaining change in net investment
    gains of $73 million, net of income tax, is principally
    attributable to an increase in impairments on fixed maturity
    securities associated with financial services industry holdings
    which experienced losses as a result of bankruptcies, FDIC
    receivership, and federal government assisted capital infusion
    transactions in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 as well as
    other credit related impairments or losses on fixed maturity
    securities where the Company did not intend to hold the
    securities until recovery in conjunction with overall market
    declines occurring throughout the year.

Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses) of
    $39 million, net of income tax, and the adverse impact of
    changes in foreign exchange rates of $13 million, net of
    income tax, income from continuing operations decreased by
    $90 million from the prior year.

Income from continuing operations decreased in:

•

Argentina by $65 million, net of income tax primarily due
    to the negative impact the 2007 Argentine pension reform had on
    the 2008 income from continuing operations. These losses were
    partially offset by the net impact resulting from the Argentine
    nationalization of the private pension system
    “Nationalization” as well as refinements to certain
    contingent and insurance liabilities associated with a Supreme
    Court ruling. In 2007, pension reform legislation eliminated the
    obligation to provide death and disability coverage by the plan
    administrators effective January 1, 2008 which created
    significant one time gains in the prior year resulting from the
    release of death and disability reserves. In addition, the
    impact of the 2007 pension reform resulted in a decrease in
    premiums for the full year of 2008 partially offset by a
    decrease in claims and market-indexed policyholder liabilities.
    In December 2008, the Argentine government nationalized the
    private pension system and seized the underlying investments.
    With this action the Company’s pension business in
    Argentina ceased to exist. As a result, the Company eliminated
    certain assets which included deferred acquisition costs and
    deferred tax assets, certain liabilities which included
    primarily the liability for future servicing obligations and
    incurred severance costs associated with the termination of
    employees. The liability for future servicing obligations was
    established due to the 2007 pension reform which resulted in the
    Company managing significant pension assets for which the
    Company would no longer receive any compensation. The
    elimination of this liability more than offset the elimination
    of assets and the incurred severance costs related to the
    Nationalization. In addition to the impact of pension reform and
    Nationalization, Argentina’s income from continuing
    operations was also favorably impacted by changes in contingent
    liabilities and the associated future policyholder benefits for
    Supreme Court case decisions related to the pesification of
    insurance contracts by the government in 2002. Other
    developments include the reduction of claim liabilities in the
    prior year from an experience review and the favorable impact in
    the current year of higher inflation rates on indexed securities
    partially offset by higher losses on the trading securities
    portfolio. Argentina’s results were impacted, in both the
    current and prior years, by valuation allowances against
    deferred taxes that are released only upon actual payment of
    taxes.

•

Japan by $53 million, net of income tax, due to a decrease
    of $146 million, net of income tax, in the Company’s
    earnings from its investment in Japan due to an increase in
    losses on embedded derivatives associated with variable annuity
    riders, an increase in DAC amortization related to market
    performance and the impact of a refinement in assumptions for
    the guaranteed annuity business partially offset by the



favorable impact from the utilization of the fair value option
    for certain fixed annuities, as well as a decrease of
    $14 million, net of income tax in earnings from assumed
    reinsurance, and an increase of $108 million, net of income
    tax, from hedging activities associated with Japan’s
    guaranteed annuity benefits.

•

The home office by $7 million, net of income tax, primarily
    due to higher economic capital charges and lower expenses in the
    prior year resulting from the elimination of intercompany
    expenses previously charged to the International segment
    partially offset by a decrease in accrued tax liabilities.

•

Mexico by $4 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    higher claims experience, an increase in certain policyholder
    liabilities caused by lower unrealized investment losses on the
    invested assets supporting those liabilities relative to the
    prior year, the favorable impact in the prior year of a decrease
    in experience refunds on Mexico’s institutional business, a
    lower increase in litigation liabilities in the prior year,
    higher expenses related to business growth and infrastructure
    costs, as well as a valuation allowance established against net
    operating losses, partially offset by the reinstatement of
    premiums from prior years, growth in the individual and
    institutional businesses, higher net investment income due to an
    increase in invested assets as well as the impact of higher
    inflation rates on indexed securities, lower DAC amortization
    resulting from management’s update of assumptions used to
    determine estimated gross profits in both the current and prior
    years, and a decrease in liabilities based on a review of
    outstanding remittances.

•

Chile by $3 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    higher spending on growth initiatives, as well as higher
    commissions and compensation expenses due to business growth
    partially offset by higher joint venture income.

Partially offsetting these decreases, income from continuing
    operations increased in:

•

Hong Kong by $18 million, net of income tax, due to the
    acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon in
    the second quarter of 2007 and the resulting consolidation of
    the operation beginning in the third quarter of 2007.

•

Ireland by $5 million, net of income tax, due to foreign
    currency transaction losses in the prior year and foreign
    currency transaction gains in the current year as well as higher
    net investment income due to an increase in invested assets,
    partially offset by higher expenses related to growth
    initiatives and the utilization in the prior year of net
    operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been
    previously established.

•

Brazil by $4 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    business growth offset by a decrease in claims liabilities in
    the prior year from an experience review and higher claim
    experience in the current year.

•

Taiwan by $4 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    an increase in invested assets and a refinement in DAC
    capitalization as well as business growth partially offset by
    the impact in both the current and prior years from refinements
    of methodologies related to the estimation of profit emergence
    on certain blocks of business.

•

South Korea by $3 million, net of income tax, primarily due
    to higher revenues from business growth and higher investment
    yields, a reduction in claim liabilities from a refinement in
    methodology, as well as a refinement in DAC capitalization,
    partially offset by higher claims and operating expenses,
    including an increase in DAC amortization related to market
    performance.

•

Australia by $3 million, net of income tax, primarily due
    to business growth slightly offset by an increase in claim
    liabilities based on a review of experience.

•

The United Kingdom by $2 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to business growth.

Contributions from the other countries account for the remainder
    of the change in income from continuing operations.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $470 million, or 9%, to $5,832 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $5,362 million for the prior year. Excluding the adverse
    impact of



changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $135 million,
    total revenues increased by $605 million, or 12%, from the
    prior year.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $468 million, or 11%, to $4,583 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $4,115 million for the
    prior year. Excluding the adverse impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates of $109 million, premiums, fees and
    other revenues increased by $577 million, or 14%, from the
    prior year.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in:

•

Chile by $150 million primarily due to higher annuity sales
    as well as higher institutional premiums from its traditional
    and bank distribution channels.

•

Mexico by $120 million due to growth in its individual and
    institutional businesses as well as the reinstatement of
    $8 million of premiums from prior years partially offset by
    a decrease of $13 million in experience refunds in the
    prior year on Mexico’s institutional business and a
    decrease in fees due to management’s update of assumptions
    used to determine estimated gross profits in both the current
    and prior years.

•

Hong Kong by $77 million primarily due to the acquisition
    of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon in the second
    quarter of 2007 and the resulting consolidation of the operation
    beginning in the third quarter of 2007 slightly offset by lower
    business growth.

•

The United Kingdom by $68 million primarily due to growth
    in the reinsurance business as well as the prior year impact of
    an unearned premium calculation refinement.

•

South Korea by $68 million due to growth in its guaranteed
    annuity and variable universal life businesses as well as in its
    traditional business.

•

Australia by $54 million as a result of growth in the
    institutional business and an increase in retention levels.

•

India, Brazil, Belgium, and Taiwan by $34 million,
    $28 million, $12 million and $3 million,
    respectively, due to business growth.

•

The Company’s Japan operations by $17 million due to
    an increase in fees from assumed reinsurance.

Partially offsetting these increases, premiums, fees and other
    revenues decreased in Argentina by $60 million primarily
    due to a decrease in premiums in the pension business, for which
    pension reform eliminated the obligation of plan administrators
    to provide death and disability coverage effective
    January 1, 2008. The decrease related to the pension
    business was partially offset by growth in its institutional and
    bancassurance businesses.

Contributions from the other countries account for the remainder
    of the change in premiums, fees and other revenues.

Net investment income is relatively flat with an increase of
    $2 million to $1,249 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 from $1,247 million for the prior
    year. Excluding the adverse impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates of $26 million, net investment
    income increased by $28 million, or 2% from the prior year.

Net investment income increased in:

•

Chile by $93 million due to the impact of higher inflation
    rates on indexed securities, the valuations and returns of which
    are linked to inflation rates, an increase in invested assets,
    as well as higher joint venture income.

•

Mexico by $75 million due to an increase in invested
    assets, the impact of higher inflation rates on indexed
    securities, higher short-term yields as well as the lengthening
    of the duration of the portfolio.

•

Japan by $20 million due to an increase of
    $166 million from hedging activities associated with
    Japan’s guaranteed annuity business partially offset by a
    decrease of $146 million, net of income tax, in the
    Company’s earnings from its investment in Japan due to an
    increase in losses on embedded derivatives associated with
    variable annuity riders and the impact of a refinement in
    assumptions for the guaranteed



annuity business partially offset by the favorable impact from
    the utilization of the fair value option for certain fixed
    annuities.

•

South Korea and Taiwan by $19 million and $9 million,
    respectively, due to increases in invested assets as well as
    higher portfolio yields.

•

Argentina by $6 million primarily due to the impact of
    higher inflation rates on indexed securities partially offset by
    higher losses on the trading securities portfolio.

•

India by $5 million primarily due to increases in invested
    assets.

Partially offsetting these increases, net investment income
    decreased in:

•

Hong Kong by $160 million despite the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon in the second quarter of
    2007 and the resulting consolidation of the operation beginning
    in the third quarter of 2007, because of the negative investment
    income for the year due to the losses on the trading securities
    portfolio which supports unit-linked policyholder liabilities.

•

The home office of $24 million primarily due to an increase
    in the amount charged for economic capital.

•

Ireland by $21 million primarily due to losses in the
    current year on the trading securities portfolio which supports
    unit-linked policyholder liabilities, partially offset by an
    increase due to higher invested assets resulting from capital
    contributions in the prior year.

Contributions from the other countries account for the remainder
    of the change in net investment income.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $448 million, or 10%, to
    $5,015 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $4,567 million for the prior year. Excluding the
    negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
    $120 million, total expenses increased by
    $568 million, or 13%, from the prior year.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $526 million, or 19%, to $3,344 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $2,818 million for the
    prior year. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates of $68 million, policyholder
    benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and interest
    credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $594 million, or 22%, from the prior year.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased in:

•

Chile by $236 million primarily due to an increase in the
    annuity and institutional businesses mentioned above, as well as
    an increase in inflation indexed policyholder liabilities.

•

Mexico by $182 million primarily due to increases in
    liabilities and other policyholder benefits commensurate with
    the growth in premiums discussed above, an increase in certain
    policyholder liabilities caused by lower unrealized investment
    losses on the invested assets supporting those liabilities
    relative to the prior year, and an increase in interest credited
    to policyholder account balances commensurate with the growth in
    investment income from inflation-indexed assets discussed above.

•

Argentina by $158 million primarily due to the prior year
    impact of a release of death and disability liabilities
    associated with the pension reform discussed above, a reduction
    of claim liabilities in the prior year from an experience review
    as well as growth in the institutional and bancassurance
    business, offset by a decrease in claims and market-indexed
    policyholder liabilities resulting from pension reform, which
    eliminated the obligation of plan administrators to provide
    death and disability coverage effective January 1, 2008.

•

The Company’s Japan operations by $39 million due to
    an increase in guarantee reserves from assumed reinsurance.



•

Australia by $38 million due to growth in the institutional
    business and an increase in retention levels as well as an
    increase in claim liabilities based on a review of experience.

•

South Korea by $31 million primarily due to higher claim
    experience and business growth offset by a reduction in claim
    liabilities due to a refinement in methodology.

•

The United Kingdom by $16 million due to the reduction in
    claim liabilities in the prior year based on a review of
    experience as well as higher claims in the current year and
    business growth.

•

India by $13 million due to business growth.

•

Brazil by $12 million due to a decrease in claims
    liabilities in the prior year from an experience review, higher
    claim experience in the current year and business growth offset
    by a decrease in interest credited to unit-linked policyholder
    liabilities reflecting net losses in the trading portfolio.

Partially offsetting these increases in policyholder benefits
    and claims, policyholder dividends and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances were decreases in:

•

Hong Kong by $113 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon in the second quarter of
    2007 and the resulting consolidation of the operation beginning
    in the third quarter of 2007, which includes a decrease in
    interest credited as a result of a reduction in unit-linked
    policyholder liabilities reflecting the losses of the trading
    portfolio backing these liabilities as discussed in the net
    investment income section above.

•

Ireland by $22 million primarily due to a decrease in
    interest credited as a result of a reduction in unit-linked
    policyholder liabilities reflecting the losses of the trading
    portfolio backing these liabilities.

Contributions from the other countries account for the remainder
    of the change in policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder
    dividends and interest credited to policyholder account balances.

Other expenses decreased by $78 million, or 4%, to
    $1,671 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $1,749 million for the prior year. Excluding the
    negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of
    $52 million, total expenses decreased by $26 million,
    or 2%, from the prior year.

Other expenses decreased in:

•

Argentina by $230 million, primarily due to the
    establishment in the prior year of a liability for pension
    servicing obligations due to pension reform, the elimination of
    the liability for pension servicing obligations and the
    elimination of DAC for the pension business in the current year
    as a result of Nationalization, as well as the elimination of
    contingent liabilities for certain cases due to recent Supreme
    Court decisions related to the pesification of insurance
    contracts by the government in 2002. Partially offsetting these
    decreases is an increase in severance costs related to
    Nationalization, as well as higher commissions from growth in
    the institutional and bancassurance business.

•

Ireland by $12 million due to foreign currency transaction
    losses in the prior year and foreign currency transaction gains
    in the current year, partially offset by higher expenses related
    to growth initiatives.

Partially offsetting these decreases, other expenses increased
    in:

•

South Korea by $50 million due to an increase in DAC
    amortization related to market performance as well as higher
    spending on advertising and marketing offset by a refinement in
    DAC capitalization.

•

The United Kingdom by $50 million due to business growth as
    well as lower DAC amortization in the prior year resulting from
    calculation refinements, partially offset by foreign currency
    transaction gains.

•

India by $28 million primarily due to increased staffing
    and growth initiatives.

•

The home office by $12 million primarily due to lower
    expenses in the prior year resulting from the elimination of
    intercompany expenses previously charged to the International
    segment, as well as higher spending on growth and infrastructure
    initiatives, partially offset by a decrease in accrued interest
    on tax liabilities.



•

Chile by $12 million primarily due to the business growth
    discussed above as well as higher commissions and compensation
    costs and higher spending on infrastructure and marketing
    programs.

•

Mexico by $11 million primarily due to higher expenses
    related to business growth and infrastructure costs, a lower
    increase in litigation liabilities in the prior year as well as
    changes in liabilities based on a review of outstanding
    remittances in both the current and prior years, partially
    offset by lower DAC amortization resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years.

•

Hong Kong by $11 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon in the second quarter of
    2007 and the resulting consolidation of the operation beginning
    in the third quarter of 2007.

•

Brazil, Belgium and Australia, each increased by
    $11 million, and Poland by $7 million primarily due to
    higher commissions related to business growth.

•

Taiwan by $5 million due to a refinement in DAC resulting
    from a refinement of methodologies related to the estimation of
    profit emergence on certain blocks of business as well as growth.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006 — International

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $472 million, or 274%, to $644 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $172 million for 2006.
    This increase includes the impact of net investment gains of
    $42 million, net of income tax.

Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses), income
    from continuing operations increased by $430 million from
    2006.

Income from continuing operations increased in:

•

Argentina by $146 million, net of income tax, primarily due
    to a net reduction of liabilities by $48 million, net of
    income tax, resulting from pension reform. Additionally,
    $66 million of a valuation allowance related to a deferred
    tax asset established in connection with such pension reform
    liabilities was reduced, resulting in a commensurate increase in
    income from continuing operations. Under the reform plan, fund
    administrators are no longer liable for death and disability
    claims of the plan participants; however, administrators retain
    the obligation for administering certain existing and future
    participants’ accounts for which they receive no revenue.
    Also contributing is the favorable impact of reductions in claim
    liabilities resulting from experience reviews in both years,
    higher premiums primarily due to higher pension contributions
    attributable to higher participant salaries, higher net
    investment income resulting from capital contributions in 2006,
    and a smaller increase in market indexed policyholder
    liabilities without a corresponding decrease in net investment
    income, partially offset by the reduction of cost of insurance
    fees as a result of the new pension system reform regulation, an
    increase in retention incentives related to pension reform, as
    well as lower trading portfolio income. Argentina also
    benefited, in both years, from the utilization of tax loss
    carryforwards against which valuation allowances had previously
    been established, and in 2007 from the reduction of valuation
    allowances due to expected realizability of deferred tax assets.

•

Mexico by $139 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    a decrease in certain policyholder liabilities caused by a
    decrease in the unrealized investment results on invested assets
    supporting those liabilities relative to 2006, the favorable
    impact of experience refunds during the first quarter of 2007 in
    its institutional business, a reduction in claim liabilities
    resulting from experience reviews, the adverse impact in 2006 of
    an adjustment for experience refunds in its institutional
    business, a year over year decrease in DAC amortization as a
    result of management’s update of assumptions used to
    determine estimated gross profits in both years, a decrease in
    liabilities based on a review of outstanding remittances, as
    well as growth in its institutional and universal life
    businesses. These increases were offset by lower fees resulting
    from management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits, the favorable impact in 2006 associated
    with a large group policy that was not renewed by the
    policyholder, a decrease in various



one-time revenue items, lower investment yields, the favorable
    impact in 2006 of liabilities related to employment matters that
    were reduced, and the benefit in 2006 from the elimination of
    liabilities for pending claims that were determined to be
    invalid following a review.

•

Taiwan by $51 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    an increase in DAC amortization in 2006 due to a loss
    recognition adjustment and prior year restructuring costs of
    $11 million associated with the termination of the agency
    distribution channel, partially offset by the favorable impact
    of liability refinements in 2006 and higher policyholder
    liabilities related to loss recognition in 2006.

•

Brazil by $37 million, net of income tax, due to the
    unfavorable impact of increases in policyholder liabilities due
    to higher than expected mortality on specific blocks of business
    in 2006, an increase in litigation liabilities in 2006 and the
    unfavorable impact of the reversal of a tax credit in 2006, as
    well as growth of the in-force business.

•

Ireland by $19 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    the utilization of net operating losses for which a valuation
    allowance had been previously established as well as higher
    investment income resulting from higher invested assets from a
    capital contribution, partially offset by higher

start-up

expenses and currency transaction losses.

•

Japan by $22 million, net of income tax, due to improved
    hedge results and business growth, partially offset by the
    impact of foreign currency transaction losses.

•

Hong Kong by $9 million, net of income tax, due to the
    acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and
    the resulting consolidation of the operation, as well as
    business growth.

•

Chile by $8 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    continued growth of the in-force business, higher joint venture
    income and higher returns on inflation indexed securities,
    partially offset by higher compensation, infrastructure and
    marketing expenses.

•

The United Kingdom by $3 million, net of income tax, due to
    a reduction of claim liabilities resulting from an experience
    review, offset by an unearned premium calculation refinement.

•

Australia by $1 million, net of income tax, due to changes
    in foreign currency exchange rates offset by higher claims and
    business growth.

Partially offsetting these increases, income from continuing
    operations decreased in:

•

The home office by $9 million, net of income tax, due to
    higher economic capital charges and investment expenses of
    $16 million, net of income tax, a $3 million increase
    in contingent tax expenses in 2007, as well as higher spending
    on growth and initiatives, partially offset by the elimination
    of certain intercompany expenses previously charged to the
    International segment and a tax benefit associated with a prior
    year income tax expense of $7 million related to a revision
    of an estimate.

•

India by $3 million, net of income tax, primarily due to
    headcount increases and growth initiatives, as well as the
    impact of valuation allowances established against losses in
    both years.

•

South Korea by $4 million, net of income tax, due to a
    favorable impact in 2006 of $38 million, net of income tax,
    in DAC amortization associated with the implementation of a more
    refined reserve valuation system, as well as additional expenses
    in 2007 associated with growth and infrastructure initiatives,
    partially offset by continued growth in its variable universal
    life business, lower DAC amortization in the variable universal
    life business due to favorable market performance and a lower
    increase in claim liabilities.

The remainder of the change in income from continuing operations
    can be attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $858 million, or 19%, to $5,362 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $4,504 million for 2006.



Premiums, fees and other revenues increased by
    $560 million, or 16%, to $4,115 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $3,555 million for 2006.

Premiums, fees and other revenues increased in:

•

Mexico by $133 million primarily due to higher fees and
    growth in its institutional and universal life businesses, a
    decrease of $13 million in experience refunds during the
    first quarter of 2007 on Mexico’s institutional business,
    as well as the adverse impact in 2006 of an adjustment for
    experience refunds on Mexico’s institutional business.
    These increases were offset by lower fees resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits, and various one-time revenue items for
    which 2006 benefited by $16 million and 2007 benefited by
    $4 million.

•

Hong Kong by $98 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation, as well as business growth.

•

Chile by $94 million primarily due to higher annuity sales
    resulting from a higher interest rate environment, improved
    competitive conditions and an expected rate increase in 2008,
    higher institutional premiums from its traditional and bank
    distribution channels, as well as the decrease in 2006 resulting
    from management’s decision not to match aggressive pricing
    in the marketplace.

•

South Korea by $90 million primarily due to higher fees
    from growth in its guaranteed annuity business and variable
    universal life business.

•

Brazil by $35 million primarily due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates and business growth.

•

The Company’s Japan operation by $31 million due to an
    increase in reinsurance assumed.

•

Australia by $26 million as a result of growth in the
    institutional and reinsurance in-force business, an increase in
    retention levels and changes in the foreign currency exchange
    rates.

•

Argentina by $21 million primarily due to an increase in
    premiums and fees from higher pension contributions resulting
    from higher participant salaries and a higher salary threshold
    subject to fees and growth in bancassurance, partially offset by
    the reduction of cost of insurance fees as a result of the new
    pension system reform regulation.

•

Taiwan and India by $21 million and $11 million,
    respectively, primarily due to business growth.

Partially offsetting these increases, premiums, fees and other
    revenues decreased in:

•

The United Kingdom by $3 million due to an unearned premium
    calculation refinement partially offset by changes in foreign
    currency rates.

The remainder of the change in premiums, fees and other revenues
    can be attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Net investment income increased by $298 million, or 31%, to
    $1,247 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $949 million for 2006.

Net investment income increased in:

•

Chile by $148 million due to the impact of higher inflation
    rates on indexed securities, the valuations and returns of which
    are linked to inflation rates, higher joint venture income, as
    well as an increase in invested assets.

•

Mexico by $46 million due to an increase in invested
    assets, partially offset by a decrease in yields, exclusive of
    inflation.

•

Hong Kong by $43 million primarily due to the acquisition
    of the remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Japan by $19 million due to an increase of $52 million
    from hedging activities associated with Japan’s guaranteed
    annuity, offset by a decrease of $33 million, net of income
    tax, in the Company’s investment in



Japan primarily due to an increase in the costs of guaranteed
    annuity benefits and the impact of foreign currency transaction
    losses, partially offset by business growth.

•

South Korea and Taiwan by $24 million and $6 million,
    respectively, primarily due to increases in invested assets.

•

Brazil by $14 million primarily due to increases in
    invested assets as well as changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates.

•

Australia by $12 million due to changes in foreign currency
    exchange rates, higher yields and increases in invested assets.

•

Ireland by $9 million due to an increase in invested assets
    resulting from capital contributions.

•

India by $4 million due to an increase in invested assets,
    as well as higher yields.

Partially offsetting these increases in net investment income
    was a decrease in:

•

The home office of $25 million primarily due to an increase
    in the amount charged for economic capital and investment
    management expenses.

•

Argentina by $7 million primarily due to unfavorable
    results in the trading portfolio, partially offset by higher
    invested assets resulting from capital contributions in 2006.
    Additionally, net investment income in 2006 did not decrease
    correspondingly with the decrease in policyholder benefits and
    claims discussed below because 2006 did not include interest-
    and inflation-indexed assets to support such liabilities.

The remainder of the change in net investment income can be
    attributed to contributions from the other countries.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a
    $106 million increase in total revenues, excluding net
    investment gains (losses).

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $340 million, or 8%, to
    $4,567 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $4,227 million for 2006.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased by
    $122 million, or 5%, to $2,818 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $2,696 million for 2006.

Policyholder benefits and claims, policyholder dividends and
    interest credited to policyholder account balances increased in:

•

Chile by $221 million primarily due to an increase in
    inflation indexed policyholder liabilities as well as growth in
    its annuity and institutional businesses.

•

Hong Kong by $119 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Taiwan by $65 million primarily due to a decrease of
    $14 million in 2006 from liability refinements associated
    with the conversion to a new valuation system, as well as higher
    policyholder liabilities related to loss recognition in the
    fourth quarter of 2006 and growth in the business.

•

South Korea by $27 million primarily due to business growth
    as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially
    offset by a lower increase in claims liabilities resulting from
    a change in the reinsurance allowance in 2006.

•

Australia by $23 million due to higher claims, an increase
    in retention levels, business growth and changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates.



•

India by $4 million due to higher claims and business
    growth, partially offset by management’s update of
    assumptions used to determine estimated gross profits.

Partially offsetting these increases in policyholder benefits
    and claims, policyholder dividends and interest credited to
    policyholder account balances were decreases in:

•

Argentina by $250 million primarily due to the elimination
    of liabilities for claims and premium deficiencies of
    $208 million resulting from pension reform. Under the
    reform plan, which is effective January 1, 2008, fund
    administrators are no longer liable for new death and disability
    claims of the plan participants. Also contributing is a decrease
    in interest- and market-indexed policyholder liabilities and the
    favorable impact of reductions in claim liabilities resulting
    from experience reviews in both the current and prior years.

•

Mexico by $63 million, primarily due to a decrease in
    certain policyholder liabilities of $117 million caused by
    a decrease in the unrealized investment results on the invested
    assets supporting those liabilities relative to 2006 and a
    reduction in claim liabilities resulting from experience
    reviews, offset by an increase of $10 million due to a
    decrease in 2006 of policyholder benefits associated with a
    large group policy that was not renewed by the policyholder, an
    increase of $6 million due to a benefit in 2006 from the
    elimination of liabilities for pending claims that were
    determined to be invalid following a review, as well as business
    growth.

•

Brazil of $13 million primarily due to the impact in 2006
    of increases in policyholder liabilities from higher than
    expected mortality on specific blocks of business, partially
    offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

The United Kingdom by $8 million, due to a reduction of
    claim liabilities based on a review of experience.

Decreases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Other expenses increased by $218 million, or 14%, to
    $1,749 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $1,531 million for 2006.

Other expenses increased in:

•

Argentina by $153 million, primarily due to a liability of
    $128 million for servicing obligations that was established
    as a result of pension reform. Under the reform plan, which is
    effective January 1, 2008, the Company retains the
    obligation for administering certain existing and future
    participants’ accounts for which they receive no revenue.
    Also contributing is an increase in commissions on bancassurance
    business, an increase in retention incentives related to pension
    reform, the impact of management’s update of DAC
    assumptions as a result of pension reform and growth, partially
    offset by a lower increase in liabilities due to inflation and
    exchange rate indexing.

•

South Korea by $92 million, primarily due to the favorable
    impact in 2006 of $60 million in DAC amortization
    associated with the implementation of a more refined reserve
    valuation system and additional expenses in 2007 associated with
    growth and infrastructure initiatives, as well as business
    growth and higher bank insurance fees, partially offset by a
    decrease in DAC amortization related to market performance.

•

Mexico by $27 million primarily due to higher expenses
    related to business growth and the favorable impact in 2006 of
    liabilities related to employment matters that were reduced,
    offset by a decrease in DAC amortization resulting from
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits in both the current and prior years, and
    a decrease in liabilities based on a review of outstanding
    remittances.

•

India by $14 million primarily due to headcount increases
    and growth initiatives, partially offset by the impact of
    management’s update of assumptions used to determine
    estimated gross profits.

•

Australia by $12 million primarily due to business growth
    and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

•

Chile by $12 million primarily due to higher compensation
    costs, higher spending on infrastructure and marketing programs
    and growth, partially offset by a decrease in DAC amortization
    related to inflation indexing.



•

Hong Kong by $11 million due to the acquisition of the
    remaining 50% interest in MetLife Fubon and the resulting
    consolidation of the operation.

•

Ireland by $10 million due to additional

start-up

costs, as well as $5 million of foreign currency
    transaction losses.

•

Brazil by $9 million primarily due to changes in foreign
    currency exchange rates, partially offset by an increase in
    litigation liabilities in 2006.

•

The United Kingdom by $2 million due to changes in foreign
    currency rates and higher spending on business initiatives,
    partially offset by lower DAC amortization resulting from
    calculation refinements.

Partially offsetting these increases in other expenses were
    decreases in:

•

Taiwan by $118 million primarily due to a one-time increase
    in DAC amortization in 2006 of $77 million due to a loss
    recognition adjustment resulting from low interest rates
    relative to product guarantees coupled with high persistency
    rates on certain blocks of business, an increase in DAC
    amortization in 2006 associated with the implementation of a new
    valuation system, expenses of $17 million in 2006 related
    the termination of the agency distribution channel and expense
    reductions recognized in 2007 due to elimination of the agency
    distribution channel.

•

The home office of $4 million primarily due to the
    elimination of certain intercompany expenses previously charged
    to the International Segment, offset by higher spending on
    growth and infrastructure initiatives.

Decreases in other countries accounted for the remainder of the
    change.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for a
    $105 million increase in total expenses.

Net
    Income

Net income decreased by $161 million, or 37%, to
    $275 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $436 million for the comparable 2007 period.

The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an
    increase in net investment losses of $98 million, net of
    income tax, and an increase in policyholder benefits and claims
    of $75 million, net of income tax.

The increase in net investment losses is due to an increase in
    losses on fixed maturity and equity securities. The increase in
    losses on fixed maturity and equity securities is primarily
    attributable to an increase in impairments associated with
    financial services industry holdings which experienced losses as
    a result of bankruptcies, FDIC receivership, and federal
    government assisted capital market infusion transactions in the
    third and fourth quarters of 2008, as well as other credit
    related impairments or losses on fixed maturity and equity
    securities where the Company did not intend to hold securities
    until recovery in conjunction with overall market declines
    occurring throughout the year.

The increase in policyholder benefits and claims of
    $75 million, net of income tax, was comprised primarily of
    an increase of $134 million, net of income tax, in
    catastrophe losses resulting from severe thunderstorms and
    tornadoes in the Midwestern and Southern states in the second
    quarter of the current year and hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Hanna
    in the third quarter of the current year, offset by
    $20 million, net of income tax, of additional favorable
    development of prior years’ catastrophe losses and loss
    adjustment expenses, primarily from hurricane Katrina. A
    decrease in non-catastrophe policyholder benefits and claims
    improved net income by $39 million, net of income tax,
    resulting from $51 million, net of income tax, of lower
    losses due to lower severity in the auto line of business and
    $8 million, net of income tax, of additional favorable
    development of prior year non-catastrophe losses and
    $8 million, net of income tax, in unallocated loss
    adjustment expenses, primarily from lower employee costs, offset
    by an increase of $23 million, net of income tax, from
    higher non-catastrophe claim frequencies primarily in the
    homeowners line of business and a $5 million, net of income
    tax, increase related to higher earned exposures.

Offsetting this decrease in net income was an increase in
    premiums of $3 million, net of income tax, comprised of an
    increase of $11 million, net of income tax, related to
    increased exposures and an increase of $16 million, net of
    income tax, from a decrease in catastrophe reinsurance costs.
    Offsetting these increases in premiums was a decrease of
    $20 million, net of income tax, related to a reduction in
    average earned premium per policy and a decrease of
    $4 million, net of income tax, in premiums from various
    involuntary programs.

In addition, net investment income decreased by $6 million,
    net of income tax, primarily due to a smaller asset base.

Also impacting net income was a decrease of $16 million,
    net of income tax, in other expenses and a decrease of
    $3 million, net of income tax, in other revenues.

Income taxes contributed $2 million to net income over the
    expected amount primarily due to favorable resolution of a prior
    year audit. A greater proportion of tax advantaged investment
    income resulted in a decline in the segment’s effective tax
    rate.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $10 million, or 0.3%, to $3,195 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $3,205 million for the comparable 2007 period.

Premiums increased by $5 million due to an increase of
    $14 million related to increased exposures and a decrease
    of $25 million in catastrophe reinsurance costs. These
    increases in premiums were offset by a decrease of
    $28 million related to a reduction in average earned
    premium per policy and a decrease of $6 million in premiums
    primarily from various involuntary programs.

Net investment income decreased by $10 million primarily
    due to a smaller asset base. Other revenues decreased
    $5 million primarily related to slower than anticipated
    claims payments resulting in slower recognition of deferred
    income in 2008 related to a reinsurance contract as compared to
    2007 and less income from COLI.



Expenses

Total expenses increased by $88 million, or 3%, to
    $2,728 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $2,640 million for the comparable 2007 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $112 million
    due to an increase of $202 million in catastrophe losses
    primarily resulting from severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in
    the Midwestern and Southern states in the second quarter of the
    current year and hurricanes Ike, Gustav and Hanna in the third
    quarter of the current year, offset by $31 million of
    additional favorable development of prior years’
    catastrophe losses and adjusting expenses, primarily from
    hurricane Katrina. Non-catastrophe policyholder benefits and
    claims decreased $59 million resulting from
    $79 million of lower losses due to lower severities,
    primarily in the auto line of business, $11 million of
    additional favorable development of prior year losses and a
    $12 million decrease in unallocated loss adjustment
    expenses primarily from lower employee costs, offset by an
    increase of $34 million from higher non-catastrophe claim
    frequencies, primarily in the homeowners line of business and a
    $9 million increase related to earned exposures.

Other expenses decreased by $25 million resulting mainly
    from a $21 million decrease in commissions, a
    $3 million decrease in surveys and underwriting reports and
    a $5 million decrease in other sales related expenses,
    offset by a $13 million change in deferred acquisition
    costs, all due to a decrease in policy activity, a decrease of
    $4 million related to a 2007 charge for structured
    settlements and a $5 million decrease from other minor
    fluctuations in a number of expense categories. Policyholder
    dividends increased by $1 million.

Underwriting results, including catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were unfavorable for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 than as compared to the 2007
    period, as the combined ratio, including catastrophes, increased
    to 91.2% from 88.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, as the combined ratio, excluding
    catastrophes, decreased to 83.1% from 86.3% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended

    Home

Net
    Income

Net income increased by $20 million, or 5%, to
    $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $416 million for the comparable 2006 period.

The increase in net income was primarily attributable to an
    increase in premiums of $28 million, net of income tax. The
    increase in premiums was principally due to an increase of
    $38 million, net of income tax, related to increased
    exposures, an increase of $4 million, net of income tax,
    from various voluntary and involuntary programs and an increase
    of $4 million, net of income tax, resulting from the change
    in estimate on auto rate refunds due to a regulatory
    examination. Offsetting these increases was a $14 million,
    net of income tax, decrease related to a reduction in average
    earned premium per policy and an increase in catastrophe
    reinsurance costs of $4 million, net of income tax.

In addition, net investment income increased by
    $12 million, net of income tax, due primarily to a
    realignment of economic capital and an increase in net
    investment income from higher yields, somewhat offset by a lower
    asset base. Net investment gains (losses) increased by
    $8 million, net of income tax, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006.

In addition, other revenues increased by $14 million, net
    of income tax, due primarily to slower than anticipated claims
    payments in 2006 resulting in slower recognition of deferred
    income in 2006 related to a reinsurance contract as compared to
    2007.

Negatively impacting net income were additional policyholder
    benefits and claims of $59 million, net of income tax,
    primarily due to $39 million, $20 million, and
    $16 million, all net of income tax, of losses related to
    higher claim frequencies, higher earned exposures and higher
    losses due to severity, respectively. In addition, a
    $13 million increase, net of income tax, in unallocated
    claims adjusting expenses and an increase of $12 million,
    net of income tax, from a reduction in favorable development of
    2006 losses negatively impacted net income. Offsetting



these increases was a $41 million, net of income tax,
    decrease in catastrophe losses, which included favorable
    development of 2006 catastrophe liabilities of $10 million,
    net of income tax.

In addition, there was a decrease of $1 million, net of
    income tax, in policyholder dividends that positively impacted
    net income.

Also favorably impacting net income was a reduction of
    $11 million, net of income tax, in other expenses related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $82 million, or 3%, to $3,205 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 from $3,123 million
    for the comparable 2006 period.

Premiums increased by $42 million due principally to a
    $59 million increase in premiums related to increased
    exposures, an increase of $5 million from various voluntary
    and involuntary programs and an increase in premiums of
    $5 million, resulting from the change in estimate on auto
    rate refunds due to a regulatory examination. Offsetting these
    increases was a $21 million decrease related to a reduction
    in average earned premium per policy and an increase in
    catastrophe reinsurance costs of $6 million.

Net investment income increased by $19 million due to a
    realignment of economic capital and an increase in net
    investment income from higher yields, somewhat offset by a lower
    asset base.

In addition, other revenues increased $21 million due
    primarily to slower than anticipated claims payments resulting
    in slower recognition of deferred income in 2006 related to a
    reinsurance contract as compared to 2007.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $72 million, or 3%, to
    $2,640 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $2,568 million for the comparable 2006 period.

Policyholder benefits and claims increased by $90 million
    which was primarily due to an increase of $59 million from
    higher claim frequencies, as a result of a return to normal
    weather patterns in 2007 compared to the milder weather in 2006
    across the majority of the country, and a $25 million and
    $30 million increase in losses related to higher severity
    and higher earned exposures, respectively. In addition, an
    increase of $20 million in unallocated loss adjustment
    expenses, primarily resulting from an increase in claims-related
    information technology costs, and a $19 million decrease in
    favorable development of 2006 losses, representing
    $148 million of favorable development for 2007 as compared
    to $167 million for the 2006 period, increased policyholder
    benefits and claims. Offsetting these increases in losses was a
    decrease of $63 million in catastrophe losses, which
    includes $15 million of favorable loss development from
    2006 catastrophes.

Policyholder dividends decreased by $1 million in 2007 as
    compared to 2006.

Other expenses decreased by $17 million primarily related
    to lower information technology and advertising costs, partially
    offset by minor changes in a variety of expense categories.

Underwriting results, excluding catastrophes, in the
    Auto & Home segment were favorable for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, although lower than the comparable
    period of 2006, as the combined ratio, excluding catastrophes,
    increased to 86.3% from 82.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations decreased by $79 million,
    or 32%, to $166 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 from $245 million for the prior year.

Included in this decrease in income from continuing operations
    is an increase in net investment gains of $586 million, net
    of income tax. The increase in net investment gains arises
    principally from the elimination of $993 million, net of
    income tax, of net investment losses arising from the transfer
    of fixed maturity securities between segments. This was
    partially offset by increased losses of $263 million, net
    of income tax, primarily due to net investment losses on fixed
    maturity securities and derivatives, and, to a much lesser
    degree, losses on equity securities, mortgage and consumer
    loans, and other limited partnership interests which are
    partially offset by foreign currency transaction gains
    originating within Corporate & Other. The fixed
    maturity and equity security losses include losses on sales of
    securities and impairments associated with financial services
    industry holdings which experienced losses as a result of
    bankruptcies, FDIC receivership, and federal government assisted
    capital infusion transactions in the third and fourth quarters
    of 2008, as well as other credit related impairments or losses
    on fixed maturity or equity securities where the Company did not
    intend to hold the securities until recovery in conjunction with
    overall market declines occurring throughout the year. The
    derivative losses were primarily driven by foreign currency
    swaps caused by unfavorable interest rate and foreign exchange
    movements. The derivative losses were partially offset by
    foreign currency transaction gains associated with foreign
    denominated long-term debt.

Excluding the impact of net investment gains (losses), income
    from continuing operations decreased by $665 million,
    compared to the prior year.



The decrease in income from continuing operations excluding net
    investment gains (losses) was primarily attributable to lower
    net investment income, higher corporate expenses, higher
    interest expense, higher legal costs and higher interest
    credited to policyholder account balances of $391 million
    $216 million, $104 million, $46 million and
    $5 million, respectively, each of which were net of income
    tax. This decrease was partially offset by higher other
    revenues, lower interest on uncertain tax positions, and lower
    interest credited to bankholder deposits of $73 million,
    $27 million and $21 million, respectively, each of
    which were net of income tax. Tax benefits decreased by
    $17 million over the prior year primarily due to a
    $16 million recognition of a deferred tax liability related
    to the RGA split-off and $1 million decrease from the
    difference of finalizing the Company’s 2007 tax return in
    2008 when compared to finalizing the Company’s 2006 tax
    return in 2007 and the actual and the estimated tax rate
    allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    decreased by $497 million, or 33%, to $1,029 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    $1,526 million for the prior year.

This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net investment
    income excluding MetLife Bank of $644 million, mainly due
    to reduced yields on other limited partnership interests
    including hedge funds and real estate and real estate joint
    ventures partially offset by higher securities lending results.
    This decrease in yields was partially offset by a higher asset
    base related to the investment of proceeds from issuances of
    junior subordinated debt in December 2007 and April 2008,
    collateral financing arrangements to support statutory reserves
    in May 2007 and December 2007, common stock in October 2008, and
    funding agreements with FHLB of NY in November 2008 partially
    offset by repurchases of outstanding common stock, the
    prepayment of shares subject to mandatory redemption in October
    2007 and the reduction of commercial paper outstanding. A
    fractional repositioning of the portfolio from short-term
    investments resulted in higher leveraged lease income. Net
    investment income on MetLife Bank increased $42 million
    from higher asset base and mortgage loan production primarily
    from acquisitions in 2008. Other revenues increased
    $112 million primarily related to MetLife Bank loan
    origination and servicing fees of $126 million from
    acquisitions in 2008, an adjustment in the prior year of
    surrender values on COLI policies of $13 million, and
    income from counterparties on collateral pledged in 2008 of
    $6 million, partially offset by $37 million lower
    revenue from a prior year resolution of an indemnification claim
    associated with the 2000 acquisition of GALIC. Also included as
    a component of total revenues was the elimination of
    intersegment amounts which was offset within total expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $498 million, or 34%, to
    $1,953 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $1,455 million for the prior year.

Corporate expenses were higher by $333 million primarily
    due to higher MetLife Bank costs of $164 million for
    compensation, rent, and mortgage loan origination and servicing
    expenses primarily related to acquisitions in 2008, higher post
    employment related costs of $101 million in the current
    year associated with the implementation of an enterprise-wide
    cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative, higher
    corporate support expenses of $72 million, which included
    incentive compensation, rent, advertising, and information
    technology costs. Corporate expenses also increased from lease
    impairments of $38 million for company use space that is
    currently vacant, and higher costs from MetLife Foundation
    contributions of $18 million, partially offset by a
    reduction in deferred compensation expenses of $60 million.
    Interest expense was higher by $158 million due to the
    issuances of junior subordinated debt in December 2007 and April
    2008 and collateral financing arrangements in May 2007 and
    December 2007, partially offset by rate reductions on variable
    rate collateral financing arrangements in 2008, the prepayment
    of shares subject to mandatory redemption in October 2007 and
    the reduction of commercial paper outstanding. Legal costs were
    higher by $72 million primarily due to asbestos insurance
    costs of $38 million, which included $35 million for
    the commutation of three asbestos-related excess insurance
    policies and $3 million for amortization and valuation of
    those policies prior to the commutation, $29 million higher
    for decreases in prior year legal liabilities partially offset
    by current year decreases resulting from the resolution of
    certain matters, and an increase in other legal fees of
    $5 million. Interest credited to policyholder account
    balances was $7 million in the current year as a result of
    issuance of funding agreements with FHLB of NY in November



2008. Interest on uncertain tax positions was lower by
    $41 million as a result of a settlement payment to the IRS
    in December 2007 and a decrease in published IRS interest rates.
    Interest credited on bankholder deposits decreased by
    $33 million at MetLife Bank due to lower interest rates,
    partially offset by higher bankholder deposits. Also included as
    a component of total expenses was the elimination of
    intersegment amounts which were offset within total revenues.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006 — Corporate &
    Other

Income
    from Continuing Operations

Income from continuing operations increased by
    $284 million, to a gain of $245 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from a loss of $39 million for
    2006. Included in this increase were lower net investment losses
    of $129 million, net of income tax. Excluding the impact of
    net investment gains (losses), income from continuing operations
    increased by $155 million.

The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily
    attributable to higher net investment income, lower corporate
    expenses, higher other revenues, integration costs incurred in
    2006, and lower legal cost of $274 million,
    $59 million, $19 million, $17 million, and
    $7 million, respectively, each of which were net of income
    tax. This was partially offset by higher interest expense on
    debt, higher interest on uncertain tax positions, and higher
    interest credited to bankholder deposits of $86 million,
    $23 million, and $3 million respectively, each of
    which were net of income tax. Tax benefits decreased by
    $102 million over the comparable period in 2006 due to the
    Company’s implementation of FIN 48, the difference of
    finalizing the Company’s 2006 tax return in 2007 when
    compared to finalizing the Company’s 2005 tax return in
    2006 and the difference between the actual and the estimated tax
    rate allocated to the various segments.

Revenues

Total revenues, excluding net investment gains (losses),
    increased by $448 million, or 42%, to $1,526 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $1,078 million for 2006. This increase was primarily due to
    increased net investment income of $421 million, mainly on
    fixed maturity securities, driven by a higher asset base related
    to the reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of the Peter
    Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town properties during the fourth
    quarter of 2006 and the investment of proceeds from issuances of
    junior subordinated debt in December 2006 and December 2007 and
    collateral financing arrangements to support statutory reserves
    in May 2007 and December 2007. Net investment income also
    increased on other limited partnerships, real estate and real
    estate joint ventures, and mortgage loans. Other revenues
    increased by $29 million primarily related to the
    resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the 2000
    acquisition of GALIC, offset by an adjustment of surrender
    values on COLI policies. Also included as a component of total
    revenues was the elimination of intersegment amounts which was
    offset within total expenses.

Expenses

Total expenses increased by $55 million, or 4%, to
    $1,455 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $1,400 million for 2006. Interest expense was higher
    by $133 million due to the issuances of junior subordinated
    debt in December 2006 and December 2007 and collateral financing
    arrangements in May 2007 and December 2007, respectively, and
    from settlement fees on the prepayment of shares subject to
    mandatory redemption in October 2007, partially offset by the
    maturity of senior notes in December 2006 and the reduction of
    commercial paper outstanding. Interest on uncertain tax
    positions was higher by $35 million as a result of an
    increase in published Internal Revenue Service interest rates
    and a change in the method of estimating interest expense on tax
    contingencies associated with the Company’s implementation
    of FIN 48. As a result of higher interest rates, interest
    credited on bank deposits increased by $5 million at
    MetLife Bank. Corporate expenses are lower by $90 million
    primarily due to lower corporate support expenses of
    $67 million, which included advertising,

start-up

costs for new products and information technology costs, and
    lower costs from reductions of MetLife Foundation contributions
    of $23 million. Integration costs incurred in prior year
    were $25 million. Legal costs were lower by
    $11 million primarily due to a reduction in 2007 of
    $35 million of legal liabilities resulting from the
    settlement of certain cases; lower other legal costs of
    $3 million partially offset by higher amortization and
    valuation of an asbestos insurance



recoverable of $27 million. Also included as a component of
    total expenses was the elimination of intersegment amounts which
    were offset within total revenues.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Extraordinary
    Market Conditions

Since mid-September 2008, the global financial markets have
    experienced unprecedented disruption, adversely affecting the
    business environment in general, as well as financial services
    companies in particular. The U.S. Government, as well as
    governments in many foreign markets in which the Company
    operates, have responded to address market imbalances and taken
    meaningful steps intended to eventually restore market
    confidence. Continuing adverse financial market conditions could
    significantly affect the Company’s ability to meet
    liquidity needs and obtain capital.

Liquidity Management.

Based upon the strength
    of its franchise, diversification of its businesses and strong
    financial fundamentals, management believes that the Company has
    ample liquidity and capital resources to meet business
    requirements under current market conditions.

Processes for monitoring and managing liquidity risk, including
    liquidity stress models, have been enhanced to take into account
    the extraordinary market conditions, including the impact on
    policyholder and counterparty behavior, the ability to sell
    various investment assets and the ability to raise incremental
    funding from various sources. Management has taken steps to
    strengthen liquidity in light of its assessment of the impact of
    market conditions and will continue to monitor the situation
    closely. Asset/Liability Management (“ALM”) needs and
    opportunities are also being evaluated and managed in light of
    market conditions and, where appropriate, ALM strategies are
    adjusted to achieve management goals and objectives. The
    Company’s short-term liquidity position (cash and cash
    equivalents and short term investments, excluding cash
    collateral received under the Company’s securities lending
    program and in connection with derivative instruments that has
    been reinvested in cash, cash equivalents, short-term
    investments and publicly-traded securities) was
    $26.7 billion and $10.9 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. This higher than normal level of
    short-term liquidity was accumulated to provide additional
    flexibility to address potential variations in cash needs while
    credit market conditions remained distressed. In 2009, we
    anticipate short-term liquidity will be brought down in a
    prudent manner and invested according to the Company’s ALM
    discipline in appropriate assets over time. There may be
    potential implications for earnings if the reinvestment process
    occurs over an extended period of time due to challenging market
    conditions or asset availability. The asset portfolio will
    continue to be defensively positioned in 2009 with an emphasis
    on higher credit quality, more liquid asset types. However,
    considering the continued, somewhat uncertain credit market
    conditions, management plans to continue to maintain a slightly
    higher than normal level of short-term liquidity.

During this extraordinary market environment, management is
    continuously monitoring and adjusting its liquidity and capital
    plans for the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in light of
    changing needs and opportunities. The dislocation in the credit
    markets has limited the access of financial institutions to
    long-term debt and hybrid capital. While, in general, yields on
    benchmark U.S. Treasury securities were historically low
    during 2008, related spreads on debt instruments, in general,
    and those of financial institutions, specifically, were as high
    as they have been in MetLife’s history as a public company.

Liquidity Needs of the Insurance
    Business.

With respect to the Company’s
    insurance businesses, Individual and Institutional segments tend
    to behave differently under these extraordinary market
    conditions. In the Company’s Individual segment, which
    includes individual life and annuity products, lapses and
    surrenders occur in the normal course of business in many
    product areas. These lapses and surrenders have not deviated
    materially from management expectations during the financial
    crisis. For both fixed and variable annuities, net flows were
    positive and lapse rates declined.

Within the Institutional segment, the retirement &
    savings business consists of general account values of
    $101 billion at December 31, 2008. Approximately,
    $97 billion of that amount is comprised of pension
    closeouts, other fixed annuity contracts without surrender or
    withdrawal options, as well as global GICs that have stated
    maturities and cannot be put back to the Company prior to
    maturity. As a result, the surrenders or withdrawals are



fairly predictable and even during this difficult environment
    they have not deviated materially from management expectations.

With regard to Institutional’s retirement &
    savings liabilities where customers have limited liquidity
    rights at December 31, 2008, there were $3 billion of
    funding agreements that could be put back to the Company after a
    period of notice. While the notice requirements vary, the
    shortest is 90 days, and that applies to only
    $1 billion of these liabilities. The remainder of the
    notice periods are between 6 and 13 months, so even on the
    small portion of the portfolio where there is ability to
    accelerate withdrawal, the exposure is relatively limited. With
    respect to credit ratings downgrade triggers that permit early
    termination, less than $1 billion of the
    retirement & savings liabilities were subject to such
    triggers. In addition, such early terminations payments are
    subject to 90 day prior notice. Management controls the
    liquidity exposure that can arise from these various product
    features.

Securities Lending.

The Company’s
    securities lending business has been affected by the
    extraordinary market environment. In this activity, blocks of
    securities, which are included in fixed maturity and short-term
    investments, are loaned to third parties, primarily major
    brokerage firms and commercial banks. The Company generally
    requires a minimum of 102% of the current estimated fair value
    of the loaned securities to be obtained at inception of a loan,
    and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for
    duration of the loan. During the extraordinary market events
    occurring in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company, in limited
    instances, accepted collateral less than 102% at the inception
    of certain loans, but never less than 100%, of the market value
    of loaned such loaned securities. These loans involved
    U.S. Treasury bills, which are considered to have limited
    variation in their market value during the term of the loan.
    Securities with a cost or amortized cost of $20.8 billion
    and $41.1 billion and an estimated fair value of
    $22.9 billion and $42.1 billion were on loan under the
    program at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or
    repledged by the transferee. The Company was liable for cash
    collateral under its control of $23.3 billion and
    $43.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Of this $23.3 billion of cash collateral at
    December 31, 2008, $5.1 billion was on open terms,
    meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to
    the Company on the next business day requiring return of cash
    collateral and $14.7 billion and $3.5 billion are due
    within 30 days and 60 days, respectively. The
    estimated fair value of the securities related to the cash
    collateral on open at December 31, 2008 has been reduced to
    $5.0 billion from $15.8 billion at November 30,
    2008. Of the $5.0 billion of estimated fair value of the
    securities related to the cash collateral on open at
    December 31, 2008, $4.4 billion were
    U.S. Treasury and agency securities which, if put to the
    Company, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash
    requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan are
    primarily U.S. Treasury and agency securities and very
    liquid residential mortgage-backed securities. The
    U.S. Treasury securities on loan were primarily holdings of

on-the-run

U.S. Treasury securities, the most liquid
    U.S. Treasury securities available. If these high quality
    securities that were on loan were put back to the Company, the
    proceeds from immediately selling these securities could be used
    to satisfy the related cash requirements. The estimated fair
    value of the reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash
    collateral was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2008, and
    consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including
    residential mortgage-backed, asset-backed, U.S. corporate
    and foreign corporate securities). If the on loan securities or
    the reinvestment portfolio were to become less liquid, the
    Company has the liquidity resources of most of its general
    account available to meet any potential cash demand when
    securities are put back to the Company. Based upon present
    market conditions, management anticipates the securities lending
    programs will be maintained in the $18 to $25 billion
    range. This estimate has been factored into the Company’s
    liquidity and investment plans. Management plans to continue to
    lend securities and believes it has appropriate policies and
    guidelines in place to manage this activity at a reduced level
    through this extraordinary business environment. See
    “— Investments — Securities
    Lending.”

Internal Asset Transfers.

MetLife employs an
    internal asset transfer process that allows for the sale of
    securities among the business portfolio segments for the
    purposes of efficient asset/liability matching. The execution of
    the internally transferred assets is permitted when mutually
    beneficial to both business segments. The asset is transferred
    at estimated fair market value with corresponding gains (losses)
    being eliminated in Corporate & Other.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, at a time of severe market
    disruption, internal asset transfers were utilized extensively
    to preserve economic value for MetLife by transferring assets
    across business segments instead of selling them to external
    parties at depressed market prices. Securities with an estimated
    fair value of $11.3 billion



were transferred across business segments in the fourth quarter
    of 2008 generating $1.4 billion in net investment losses,
    principally within Individual and Institutional, with the offset
    in Corporate & Other’s net investment gains
    (losses).

Collateral.

The Company does not operate a
    financial guarantee or financial products business with
    exposures in derivative products that could give rise to
    extremely large collateral calls. The Company is a net receiver
    of collateral from counterparties under the Company’s
    current derivative transactions. With respect to derivative
    transactions with credit ratings downgrade triggers, a two notch
    downgrade would impact the Company’s derivative collateral
    requirements by less than $200 million at December 31,
    2008. As a result, the Company does not have significant
    exposure to any credit ratings dependent liquidity factors
    resulting from current derivatives positions.

Holding Company.

The Holding Company relies
    principally on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash
    requirements. None of the Holding Company long-term debt is due
    before 2011, so there is no near-term roll-over risk. The
    Holding Company’s commercial paper program, which amounts
    to $300 million at December 31, 2008, is kept active
    but is not used to fund on-going operating business
    requirements. In addition to its other fixed obligations, the
    Holding Company has and may be required to pledge further
    collateral under collateral support agreements if the estimated
    fair value of the related derivatives

and/or

collateral financing arrangements declines. The Holding Company
    holds significant liquid assets of $2.7 billion at
    December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2008, the Holding
    Company had pledged $820 million of liquid assets under
    collateral support agreements. See
    “— Investments — Assets on Deposit,
    Held in Trust and Pledged as Collateral.”

Government Programs.

The Company is
    participating in certain economic stabilization programs
    established by various government institutions as described
    under “The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources.”

Capital.

This shift resulted in a relative
    increase in the cost of new debt capital and new credit. For
    example, in August 2008, MetLife remarketed senior unsecured
    debt with a ten-year maturity at a 6.817% coupon. At
    December 31, 2008, the average coupon on ten-year senior
    unsecured debt of the Holding Company, excluding the debt
    remarketed in August 2008, is 5.40%, or 1.40% less than that of
    the debt remarketed in August 2008.

MetLife has no floating rate debt, other than that of the
    collateral financing arrangements of $5.2 billion which
    float based upon

3-month

LIBOR and the proceeds of which are invested in floating rate
    assets, and has issued $600 million in a single series of
    LIBOR-based preferred stock with a 4% floor. This series
    represents a small portion of MetLife’s fixed charges. At
    current levels, LIBOR would have to increase by 180 basis
    points (over 145% increase) to have any impact on the dividend
    for these preferred securities.

MetLife amended and restated certain of its credit agreements in
    December 2008. These changes included increases in pricing for
    these agreements compared to the original rates.

In February 2009, the Holding Company closed the successful
    remarketing of the Series B portion of the junior
    subordinated debentures underlying the common equity units. The
    Series B junior subordinated debentures were modified as
    permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior debt securities,
    Series B, due February 15, 2019. See
    “— Subsequent Events.” This issuance
    reflects a moderate increase in the Company’s cost of
    borrowing.

As discussed above, market values experienced significant
    volatility during the third and fourth quarters of 2008. This
    market disruption impacted unrealized gains and losses, which
    are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    To strengthen our capital position and increase our cushion
    against potential realized and unrealized losses in October
    2008, the Company issued common stock for gross proceeds of
    $2.3 billion to be used for general corporate purposes and
    potential strategic initiatives.

MetLife has no current plans to raise additional capital.



The
    Company

Capital

Capital and liquidity represent the financial strength of the
    Company and reflect its ability to generate strong cash flows at
    the operating companies, borrow funds at competitive rates and
    raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs. To
    strengthen its capital position, in October 2008, the Company
    issued $2.3 billion of common stock. The Company’s
    capital structure is managed to maintain a “AA”
    financial strength ratings target.

Statutory Capital and Dividends.

Our insurance
    subsidiaries have statutory surplus and RBC levels well above
    levels to meet current regulatory requirements and levels needed
    to support the business risk at an “AA” financial
    strength rating.

RBC requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the
    National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) and the state insurance departments to
    identify companies that merit further regulatory action. RBC is
    based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various
    asset, premium and statutory reserve items. The formula takes
    into account the risk characteristics of the insurer, including
    asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business risk
    and is calculated on an annual basis. The formula is used as an
    early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately
    capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory
    action, and not as a means to rank insurers generally. These
    rules apply to each of the Holding Company’s domestic
    insurance subsidiaries. State insurance laws provide insurance
    regulators the authority to require various actions by, or take
    various actions against, insurers whose total adjusted capital
    does not exceed certain RBC levels. At the date of the most
    recent annual statutory financial statements filed with
    insurance regulators, the total adjusted capital of each of
    these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those RBC levels.

The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay
    to MetLife, Inc. or other parent entities is constrained by the
    amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings, and to
    provide an additional margin for risk protection and for future
    investment in our businesses. We proactively take actions to
    maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives, which
    may include adjusting dividend amounts and redeploying financial
    resources from internal or external sources of capital. Certain
    of these activities may require regulatory approval.

Rating Agencies.

The rating agencies assign
    insurer financial strength ratings to the Company’s
    domestic life subsidiaries and credit ratings to subsidiaries of
    the Company which directly issue or guarantee substantially all
    of the Company’s senior unsecured obligations. The level
    and composition of our regulatory capital at the subsidiary
    level and equity capital of the Company are among the many
    factors considered in determining the Company’s insurer
    financial strength and credit ratings. Each agency has its own
    capital adequacy evaluation methodology and assessments are
    generally based on a combination of factors.

The Company’s financial strength ratings targets for its
    domestic life insurance companies are “AA/Aa2/AA/A+”
    for S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and A.M. Best. The
    Company’s long-term senior debt credit rating targets are
    “A/A2/A/a” for S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and
    A.M. Best.

In November 2008, A.M. Best downgraded the insurer
    financial strength rating for Texas Life Insurance Company from
    A to A-.

At December 31, 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch, Moody’s
    and S&P each had MetLife and its Subsidiaries’ insurer
    financial strength and credit ratings on “stable”
    outlook; however, (i) on February 9, 2009,
    Moody’s revised its outlook to “negative,”
    (ii) on February 11, 2009, Fitch revised its outlook
    to “negative” and anticipates completing its review
    within the next several weeks and will reflect those results in
    the ratings at that time, (iii) on February 20, 2009,
    A.M. Best downgraded the credit ratings of MetLife, Inc.
    and certain of its subsidiaries with a stable outlook, and
    (iv) on February 26, 2009, S&P downgraded the
    insurer financial strength and credit ratings of MetLife, Inc.
    and certain of its subsidiaries, with a “substantive”
    outlook.

In September and October 2008, A.M. Best, Fitch,
    Moody’s, and S&P each revised its outlook for the
    U.S. life insurance sector to negative from stable. In
    January 2009, S&P reiterated its negative outlook on the
    U.S. life insurance sector. Management believes that the
    rating agencies may heighten the level of scrutiny that they
    apply to such institutions, may increase the frequency and scope
    of their credit reviews, may request additional information



from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the
    capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency
    models for maintenance of certain ratings levels.

A downgrade in the credit or financial strength (i.e.,
    claims-paying) ratings of the Company or its subsidiaries would
    likely impact the cost and availability of unsecured financing
    for the Company and its subsidiaries and result in additional
    collateral requirements or other required payments under certain
    agreements, which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by
    posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the
    agreements.

Liquidity

Liquidity refers to a company’s ability to generate
    adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs. The Company’s
    liquidity position is defined as cash and cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding
    (i) cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded
    securities; (ii) cash collateral received from
    counterparties in connection with derivative instruments;
    (iii) cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    publicly-traded securities on deposit with regulatory agencies;
    and (iv) securities

held-in-trust

in support of collateral financing arrangements and pledged in
    support of debt and funding agreements. The Company’s
    liquidity position was $139.4 billion and
    $163.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Liquidity needs are determined from a rolling

12-month

forecast by portfolio and are monitored daily. Asset mix and
    maturities are adjusted based on forecast. Cash flow testing and
    stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity,
    which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early
    contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. Management believes
    that the Company has ample liquidity and capital resources to
    meet business requirements and unlikely but reasonably possible
    stress scenarios under current market conditions. The Company
    includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its
    products, including general account institutional pension
    products (generally group annuities, including GICs, and certain
    deposit fund liabilities) sold to employee benefit plan
    sponsors. Certain of these provisions prevent the customer from
    making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product.

In the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements
    beyond normal liquidity needs, the Company has various
    alternatives available depending on market conditions and the
    amount and timing of the liquidity need. These options include
    cash flows from operations, the sale of liquid assets, global
    funding sources and various credit facilities.

Under stressful market and economic conditions, liquidity
    broadly deteriorates which could negatively impact the
    Company’s ability to sell investment assets. If the Company
    requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess
    of normal cash requirements, the Company may have difficulty
    selling investment assets in a timely manner, be forced to sell
    them for less than the Company otherwise would have been able to
    realize, or both. In addition, in the event of such forced sale,
    accounting rules require the recognition of a loss and may
    require the impairment of other such securities based upon the
    Company’s ability to hold such securities which, may
    negatively impact the Company’s financial statements.

In extreme circumstances, all general account assets —
    other than those which may have been pledged to a specific
    purpose — within a statutory legal entity are
    available to fund obligations of the general account within that
    legal entity. A disruption in the financial markets could limit
    the Holding Company’s access to or cost of liquidity. See
    “Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Cash Flows from Operations.

The Company’s
    principal cash inflows from its insurance activities come from
    insurance premiums, annuity considerations and deposit funds. A
    primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows is
    the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal.
    See “Extraordinary Market Conditions” and
    “Liquidity and Capital Uses — Contractual
    Obligations.”

Cash Flows from Investments.

The
    Company’s principal cash inflows from its investment
    activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from
    maturities and sales of invested assets and net investment
    income. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these
    cash inflows are the risk of default by debtors and market



volatilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these
    risks through its credit risk management process. During the
    latter half of 2008, the Company increased its short-term
    liquidity position in response to the extraordinary market
    conditions. The Company’s short-term liquidity position
    defined as cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
    excluding both cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and collateral received
    from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments
    was $26.7 billion and $10.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See
    “— Investments — Current
    Environment.”

Liquid Assets.

An integral part of the
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding
    (i) cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded
    securities; (ii) cash collateral received from
    counterparties in connection with derivative instruments;
    (iii) cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
    securities on deposit with regulatory agencies; and
    (iv) securities held in trust in support of collateral
    financing arrangements and pledged in support of debt and
    funding agreements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had $139.4 billion and $163.8 billion in
    liquid assets, respectively. For further discussion of invested
    assets on deposit with regulatory agencies, held in trust in
    support of collateral financing arrangements and pledged in
    support of debt and funding agreements. See
    “— Investments — Assets on Deposit,
    Held in Trust and Pledged as Collateral.”

Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of short-term instruments, including
    repurchase agreements and commercial paper. Capital is provided
    by a variety of long-term instruments, including medium- and
    long-term debt, junior subordinated debt securities, capital
    securities and stockholders’ equity. The diversity of the
    Company’s funding sources enhances flexibility, limits
    dependence on any one source of funds and generally lowers the
    cost of funds. See “Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

During the turbulent market conditions of 2008, the Company has
    utilized various means of short-term and long-term financing
    including:

•

The Company is participating in certain economic stabilization
    programs established by various government institutions. The
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Commercial Paper Funding
    Facility (“CPFF”) is intended to improve liquidity in
    short-term funding markets by increasing the availability of
    term commercial paper funding to issuers and by providing
    greater assurance to both issuers and investors that firms will
    be able to rollover their maturing commercial paper. MetLife
    Short Term Funding LLC, the issuer of commercial paper under a
    program supported by funding agreements issued by Metropolitan
    Life Insurance Company and MetLife Insurance Company of
    Connecticut, was accepted in October 2008 for the CPFF and may
    issue a maximum amount of $3.8 billion under the CPFF. At
    December 31, 2008, MetLife Short Term Funding LLC had used
    $1,650 million of its available capacity under the CPFF,
    and such amount was deposited under the related funding
    agreements. MetLife Funding, Inc. was accepted in November 2008
    for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s CPFF and may
    issue a maximum amount of $1 billion under the CPFF. No
    drawdown by MetLife Funding, Inc. has taken place under this
    facility as of the date hereof. In December 2008, MetLife, Inc.
    elected to continue to participate in the debt guarantee
    component of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s
    (“FDIC”) Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the
    “FDIC Program”). Under the terms of the FDIC Program,
    the FDIC will guarantee through June 2012 (or maturity, if
    earlier) the payment of certain newly-issued senior unsecured
    debt of MetLife, Inc. and any eligible affiliates. The Company
    also notified the FDIC that it elected the option of excluding
    specified senior unsecured debt maturing after June 30,
    2012 from the guarantee before reaching the limits on the amount
    of guaranteed debt under the FDIC Program ($398 million for
    MetLife, Inc. and $178 million for MetLife Bank, N.A. which
    may issue guaranteed debt under its limit, as well as unused
    amounts under MetLife, Inc.’s limit). The Company opted out
    of the component of the FDIC Program that guarantees
    non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts. Management
    cannot predict how the markets may react to these elections or
    to any debt issued subject to the terms of the FDIC Program.

MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. each have commercial
    paper programs. The commercial paper markets have effectively
    closed to certain issuers, depending upon their ratings.
    Depending on market conditions, we may issue shorter maturities
    than we would otherwise like.



•

MetLife Bank, N.A. has pledged loans and securities with the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York to have the capacity to borrow
    at the Discount Window or under the Term Auction Facility. At
    December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank had borrowed
    $950 million under the Term Auction Facility for various
    short-term maturities. In addition, as a member of the Federal
    Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB of NY”), MetLife
    Bank has entered into repurchase agreements with FHLB of NY on a
    short-term and long-term basis, with a total liability for
    repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY of $1.8 billion
    at December 31, 2008. Management expects MetLife Bank to
    take further advantage of these funding sources in the future.
    In addition, the Company had obligations under funding
    agreements with the FHLB of NY of $15.2 billion and
    $4.6 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007 respectively for MLIC and with the FHLB
    of Boston of $526 million and $726 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 respectively
    for MICC. The FHLB of Boston had also advanced $300 million
    to MICC at December 31, 2008, which is included in
    short-term debt. In the current market environment, the Federal
    Home Loan Bank system has demonstrated its commitment to provide
    funding to its members especially through these stressful market
    conditions. Management expects the renewal of these funding
    resources. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements

As described below in “Debt Issuances and Other
    Borrowings” and above in “Extraordinary Market
    Conditions” the Company sold various long-term debt
    securities in August 2008 and February 2009 in connection with
    the remarketing of the junior subordinated debentures issued in
    connection with the common equity units. The Company also issued
    common stock in October 2008 as described in “Extraordinary
    Market Conditions.”

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had outstanding
    $2.7 billion and $667 million in short-term debt,
    respectively, and $9.7 billion and $9.1 billion in
    long-term debt, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, the Company had outstanding $5.2 billion and
    $4.9 billion in collateral financing arrangements,
    respectively, and $3.8 billion and $4.1 billion in
    junior subordinated debt, respectively. Long-term and short-term
    debt includes certain advances from the FHLB of NY.

Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings.

In April
    2008, MetLife Capital Trust X, a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) consolidated by the Company, issued
    exchangeable surplus trust securities (the “2008
    Trust Securities”) with a face amount of
    $750 million. The 2008 Trust Securities will be
    exchanged into a like amount of the Holding Company’s
    junior subordinated debentures on April 8, 2038, the
    scheduled redemption date, mandatory under certain
    circumstances, and at any time upon the Holding Company
    exercising its option to redeem the securities. The 2008
    Trust Securities will be exchanged for junior subordinated
    debentures prior to repayment. The final maturity of the
    debentures is April 8, 2068. The Holding Company may cause
    the redemption of the 2008 Trust Securities or debentures
    (i) in whole or in part, at any time on or after
    April 8, 2033 at their principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or (ii) in
    certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior to
    April 8, 2033 at their principal amount plus accrued and
    unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a
    make-whole price. Interest on the 2008 Trust Securities or
    debentures is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 9.25% up
    to, but not including, April 8, 2038, the scheduled
    redemption date. In the event the 2008 Trust Securities or
    debentures are not redeemed on or before the scheduled
    redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 5.540%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    2008 Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the 2008
    Trust Securities, the Holding Company entered into a
    replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). As a part of the
    RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem,
    or purchase the debentures on or before April 8, 2058,
    unless, subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds
    from the sale of specified capital securities. The RCC will
    terminate upon the occurrence of certain events, including an
    acceleration of the debentures due to the occurrence of an event
    of default. The RCC is not intended for the benefit of holders
    of the debentures and may not be enforced by them. The RCC is
    for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated
    series of its indebtedness (which will initially be its
    5.70% senior notes due June 15, 2035). The Holding
    Company also entered into a replacement capital obligation which
    will commence in 2038 and under which the Holding Company must
    use



reasonable commercial efforts to raise replacement capital
    through the issuance of certain qualifying capital securities.
    Issuance costs associated with the offering of the 2008
    Trust Securities of $8 million have been capitalized,
    are included in other assets, and are amortized using the
    effective interest method over the period from the issuance date
    of the 2008 Trust Securities until their scheduled
    redemption. Interest expense on the 2008 Trust Securities
    was $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In December 2007, MetLife Capital Trust IV
    (“Trust IV”), a VIE consolidated by the Company,
    issued exchangeable surplus trust securities (the “2007
    Trust Securities”) with a face amount of
    $700 million and a discount of $6 million
    ($694 million). The 2007 Trust Securities will be
    exchanged into a like amount of Holding Company junior
    subordinated debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled
    redemption date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at
    any time upon the Holding Company exercising its option to
    redeem the securities. The 2007 Trust Securities will be
    exchanged for junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment.
    The final maturity of the debentures is December 15, 2067.
    The Holding Company may cause the redemption of the 2007
    Trust Securities or debentures (i) in whole or in
    part, at any time on or after December 15, 2032 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to December 15, 2032 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest on the
    2007 Trust Securities or debentures is payable
    semi-annually at a fixed rate of 7.875% up to, but not
    including, December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption
    date. In the event the 2007 Trust Securities or debentures
    are not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date,
    interest will accrue at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 3.96%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    2007 Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the 2007
    Trust Securities, the Holding Company entered into a RCC.
    As a part of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will
    not repay, redeem, or purchase the debentures on or before
    December 15, 2057, unless, subject to certain limitations,
    it has received proceeds from the sale of specified capital
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the debentures due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of its indebtedness
    (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered into a
    replacement capital obligation which will commence in 2037 and
    under which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial
    efforts to raise replacement capital through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated
    with the offering of the 2007 Trust Securities of
    $10 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and are amortized using the effective interest method
    over the period from the issuance date of the 2007
    Trust Securities until their scheduled redemption. Interest
    expense on the 2007 Trust Securities was $55 million
    and $3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively.

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston, a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with this
    transaction, MRC issued, to investors placed by an unaffiliated
    financial institution, $2.5 billion of 35 year surplus
    notes to provide statutory reserve support for the assumed
    closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes accrues
    at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make
    interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is
    contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval. At both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, surplus notes outstanding were
    $2.5 billion. Simultaneous with the issuance of the surplus
    notes, the Holding Company entered into an agreement with the
    unaffiliated financial institution, under which the Holding
    Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus
    notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below. Under this agreement, the Holding Company
    may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to
    the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in
    the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments
    would be accounted for as a receivable and included under other
    assets on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    and would not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the
    surplus notes. In addition, the Holding Company may also be
    required to make a payment to the unaffiliated financial
    institution in connection with any early termination of this
    agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the



Holding Company paid $800 million to the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to a decline in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. This payment reduced the amount
    under the agreement on which the Holding Company’s interest
    payment is due but did not reduce the outstanding amount of the
    surplus notes. In addition, the Holding Company had pledged
    collateral of $230 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution at December 31, 2008. No collateral had been
    pledged at December 31, 2007. A majority of the proceeds
    from the offering of the surplus notes were placed in trust,
    which is consolidated by the Company, to support MRC’s
    statutory obligations associated with the assumed closed block
    liabilities. During 2007 and 2008, the Company deposited
    $2.0 billion and $314 million, respectively, into the
    trust, from the proceeds of the surplus notes issued in 2007. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the estimated fair value of
    assets held in trust by the Company was $2.1 billion and
    $2.0 billion, respectively. The assets are principally
    invested in fixed maturity securities and are presented as such
    within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with the
    related income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated income statement. Interest on the
    collateral financing arrangement is included as a component of
    other expenses. Total interest expense was $117 million and
    $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. See “The Holding Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Uses — Support Agreements”
    for a description of the support arrangement entered into in
    connection with this transaction.

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MetLife Reinsurance Company
    of South Carolina (“MRSC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of the Company, entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $2.7 billion and
    $2.4 billion, respectively, had been drawn upon under the
    collateral financing arrangement. The collateral financing
    arrangement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing. Proceeds from the collateral financing
    arrangement were placed in trust to support MRSC’s
    statutory obligations associated with the reinsurance of
    secondary guarantees. The trust is a VIE which is consolidated
    by the Company. The unaffiliated financial institution is
    entitled to the return on the investment portfolio held by the
    trust. In connection with the collateral financing arrangement,
    the Holding Company entered into an agreement with the same
    unaffiliated financial institution under which the Holding
    Company is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio
    held by the trust established in connection with this collateral
    financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of a stated
    rate of return to the unaffiliated financial institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may
    also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trust, as
    well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination
    of the collateral financing arrangement. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company paid
    $320 million to the unaffiliated financial institution as a
    result of the decline in the estimated fair value of the assets
    in the trust. All of the $320 million was deposited into
    the trust. In January 2009, the Holding Company paid an
    additional $360 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution as a result of the continued decline in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in trust which was also
    deposited into the trust. In addition, the Holding Company may
    be required to pledge collateral to the unaffiliated financial
    institution under this agreement. At December 31, 2008, the
    Holding Company had pledged $86 million under the
    agreement. No collateral had been pledged under the agreement at
    December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company held assets in trust with an estimated fair value of
    $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively,
    associated with this transaction. The assets are principally
    invested in fixed maturity securities and are presented as such
    within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with the
    related income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated income statement. Interest on the
    collateral financing arrangement is included as a component of
    other expenses. Transaction costs associated with the collateral
    financing arrangement of $5 million have been capitalized,
    are included in other assets, and are amortized using the
    effective interest method over the period from the issuance of
    the collateral financing arrangement to its expiration. Total
    interest expense was $107 million and $84 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    See “The Holding Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Uses — Support Agreements” for a description of
    the support arrangement entered into in connection with this
    transaction.

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. The
    debentures are scheduled for redemption on December 15,
    2036; the final maturity of the



debentures is December 15, 2066. The Holding Company may
    redeem the debentures (i) in whole or in part, at any time
    on or after December 15, 2031 at their principal amount
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption, or
    (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or in part, prior
    to December 15, 2031 at their principal amount plus accrued
    and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, a
    make-whole price. Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed
    rate of 6.40% up to, but not including, December 15, 2036,
    the scheduled redemption date. In the event the debentures are
    not redeemed on or before the scheduled redemption date,
    interest will accrue at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for
    more than five consecutive years, the Holding Company may be
    required to use proceeds from the sale of its common stock or
    warrants on common stock to satisfy its obligation. In
    connection with the issuance of the debentures, the Holding
    Company entered into a RCC. As part of the RCC, the Holding
    Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the
    debentures on or before December 15, 2056, unless, subject
    to certain limitations, it has received proceeds from the sale
    of specified capital securities. The RCC will terminate upon the
    occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration of the
    debentures due to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC
    is not intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and
    may not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of
    holders of one or more other designated series of its
    indebtedness (which will initially be its 5.70% senior
    notes due June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered
    into a replacement capital obligation which will commence in
    2036 and under which the Holding Company must use reasonable
    commercial efforts to raise replacement capital through the
    issuance of certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance
    costs associated with the offering of the debentures of
    $13 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and are amortized using the effective interest method
    over the period from the issuance date of the debentures until
    their scheduled redemption. Interest expense on the debentures
    was $80 million, $80 million and $2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

MetLife Bank has entered into several repurchase agreements with
    the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife Bank has issued repurchase
    agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB of NY has
    been granted a blanket lien on MetLife Bank’s residential
    mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to collateralize
    MetLife Bank’s obligations under the repurchase agreements.
    The repurchase agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is
    limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the
    outstanding repurchase agreements. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, MetLife Bank received
    advances totaling $220 million, $390 million and
    $260 million, respectively, from the FHLB of NY, which were
    included in long-term debt. MetLife Bank also made repayments of
    $371 million, $175 million and $117 million to
    the FHLB of NY during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, in 2008 following the
    acquisition of a mortgage origination and servicing business,
    MetLife Bank began a program of taking short-term advances from
    the FHLB of NY. The amount of the Company’s liability for
    repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY that is included in
    long-term debt was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively and the amount
    that is included in short-term debt was $695 million at
    December 31, 2008.

MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife Funding”), a
    subsidiary of MLIC, serves as a centralized finance unit for the
    Company. Pursuant to a support agreement, MLIC has agreed to
    cause MetLife Funding to have a tangible net worth of at least
    one dollar. At both December 31, 2008 and 2007, MetLife
    Funding had a tangible net worth of $12 million. MetLife
    Funding raises cash from various funding sources and uses the
    proceeds to extend loans, through MetLife Credit Corp., another
    subsidiary of MLIC, to the Holding Company, MLIC and other
    affiliates. MetLife Funding manages its funding sources to
    enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of MLIC and
    other affiliated companies. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    MetLife Funding had total outstanding liabilities, including
    accrued interest payable, of $414 million and
    $358 million, respectively, consisting primarily of
    commercial paper.

The Company is participating in certain economic stabilization
    programs established by various government institutions,
    including the CPFF and the FDIC program, as described above.

Credit Facilities.

The Company maintains
    committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating
    $3.2 billion at December 31, 2008. When drawn upon,
    these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance
    with the respective agreements as specified below. The
    facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, at



December 31, 2008, $2.9 billion of the facilities also
    served as

back-up

lines of credit for the Company’s commercial paper
    programs. Management has no reason to believe that its lending
    counterparties are unable to fulfill their respective
    contractual obligations.

Total fees associated with these credit facilities were
    $17 million, of which $11 million related to deferred
    amendment fees for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Information on these credit facilities at December 31, 2008

In December 2008, the Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc.
    entered into an amended and restated $2.85 billion credit
    agreement with various financial institutions. The agreement
    amended and restated the $3.0 billion credit agreement
    entered into in June 2007. Proceeds are available to be used for
    general corporate purposes, to support their commercial paper
    programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. The Company
    limits its commercial paper outstanding relative to the amount
    of unused commitments under this facility. All borrowings under
    the credit agreement must be repaid by June 2012, except that
    letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain
    outstanding until June 2013. The borrowers and the lenders under
    this facility may agree to extend the term of all or part of the
    facility to no later than June 2014, except that letters of
    credit outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until
    June 2015. Fees for this agreement include a 0.25% facility fee,
    0.075% fronting fee, a letter of credit fee between 1% and 5%
    based on certain market rates and a 0.05% utilization fee, as
    applicable, and may vary based on MetLife, Inc.’s senior
    unsecured ratings. The Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc.
    incurred amendment costs of $11 million related to the
    $2,850 million amended and restated credit agreement, which
    have been capitalized and included in other assets. These costs
    will be amortized over the term of the agreement. The Holding
    Company did not have any deferred financing costs associated
    with the original June 2007 credit agreement.

(2)

In July 2008, the facility was increased by $100 million
    and its maturity extended for one year to July 2009. Fees for
    this agreement include a commitment fee of $10,000 and a margin
    of Federal Funds plus 0.11%, as applicable.

Committed Facilities.

The Company maintains
    committed facilities aggregating $11.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008. When drawn upon, these facilities bear
    interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective
    agreements as specified below. The facilities are used for
    collateral for certain of the Company’s insurance
    liabilities. Management has no reason to believe that its
    lending counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual
    obligations.



Total fees associated with these committed facilities were
    $35 million, of which $13 million related to deferred
    amendment fees for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In September 2008, MRV and the Holding Company entered into a

30-year,

$3.5 billion letter of credit facility with an unaffiliated
    financial institution. These letters of credit serve as
    collateral for MRV’s obligations under a reinsurance
    agreement.

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2008,
    the Company had outstanding $6.6 billion in letters of
    credit from various financial institutions of which
    $4.3 billion and $2.3 billion were part of committed
    and credit facilities, respectively. As commitments associated
    with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire
    unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.

Covenants.

Certain of the Company’s debt
    instruments, credit facilities and committed facilities contain
    various administrative, reporting, legal and financial
    covenants. The Company believes it is in compliance with all
    covenants at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Liquidity
    and Capital Uses

Debt Repayments.

On October 31, 2007, the
    Company redeemed $125 million of 8.525% GenAmerica Capital
    I Capital Securities which were due to mature on June 30,
    2027. As a result of this repayment, the Company recognized
    additional interest expense of $10 million.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    MetLife Bank made repayments of $371 million,
    $175 million, and $117 million, respectively, to the
    FHLB of NY related to long-term borrowings. During the year
    ended December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank made repayments of
    $4.6 billion to the FHLB of NY and $650 million to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York related to short-term
    borrowings. See “Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Debt Issuances and Other Borrowings” for further
    information.

The Holding Company repaid a $500 million 5.25% senior
    note which matured in December 2006.

Insurance Liabilities.

The Company’s
    principal cash outflows primarily relate to the liabilities
    associated with its various life insurance, property and
    casualty, annuity and group pension products, operating expenses
    and income tax, as well as principal and interest on its
    outstanding debt obligations. Liabilities arising from its
    insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under
    the aforementioned products, as well as payments for policy
    surrenders, withdrawals and loans. See “Contractual
    Obligations.”

Investment and Other.

Additional cash outflows
    include those related to obligations of securities lending
    activities, investments in real estate, limited partnerships and
    joint ventures, as well as litigation-related liabilities.

Securities Lending.

The Company participates
    in a securities lending program whereby blocks of securities,
    which are included in fixed maturity and equity securities, are
    loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms and
    commercial banks. The Company requires collateral equal to 102%
    of the current estimated fair value of the loaned securities to
    be obtained at the inception of a loan, and maintained at a
    level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the
    loan. During the extraordinary market events occurring in the
    fourth quarter of 2008, the Company, in limited instances,
    accepted collateral less than 102% at the inception of certain
    loans, but never less than 100%, of the estimated fair value of
    such loaned securities. These loans involved U.S. Treasury
    Bills which are considered to have limited variation in their
    estimated fair value during the term of the loan. The Company
    was liable for cash collateral under its control of
    $23.3 billion and $43.3 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. During the unprecedented market
    disruption since mid-September 2008, the demand for securities
    loans from the Company’s counterparties has decreased. The
    volume of securities lending has decreased in line with reduced
    demand from counterparties and reduced trading capacity of
    certain segments of the fixed income securities market. See
    “Extraordinary Market Conditions” for further
    information.

Separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above.
    Generally, the separate account owner, rather than the Company,
    bears the investment risk of these funds. The separate account
    assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims
    that arise out of any other business of the Company. Net
    deposits, net investment income and realized and unrealized
    capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully
    offset by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders
    whose liability is reflected with the separate account
    liabilities. Separate account liabilities are fully funded by
    cash flows from the separate account assets and are set equal to
    the estimated fair value of separate account assets as
    prescribed by

SOP 03-1.

The Company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and
    services in the normal course of business; however, these
    purchase obligations are not material to its consolidated
    results of operations or financial position at December 31,
    2008.

Additionally, the Company has agreements in place for services
    it conducts, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to
    insurance, reinsurance, loans, and capitalization. Intercompany
    transactions have appropriately been eliminated in
    consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance
    subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the
    appropriate departments of insurance as required.

Support Agreements.

The Holding Company and
    several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are
    parties to various capital support commitments, guarantees and
    contingent reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of
    the Holding Company and a corporation in which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under these arrangements, each
    Obligor, with respect to the applicable entity, has agreed to
    cause such entity to meet specified



capital and surplus levels, has guaranteed certain contractual
    obligations or has agreed to provide, upon the occurrence of
    certain contingencies, reinsurance for such entity’s
    insurance liabilities. Management anticipates that to the extent
    that these arrangements place significant demands upon the
    Company, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to
    enable the Company to meet these demands. See “The Holding
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses —
    Support Agreements.”

Litigation.

Putative or certified class action
    litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments
    against the Company, in addition to those discussed elsewhere
    herein and those otherwise provided for in the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of
    the Company’s business, including, but not limited to, in
    connection with its activities as an insurer, employer,
    investor, investment advisor and taxpayer. Further, state
    insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state
    authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations
    concerning the Company’s compliance with applicable
    insurance and other laws and regulations.

It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome
    of all pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses except as noted elsewhere
    herein in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to herein, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcome of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to
    have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Fair Value.

The estimated fair value of the
    Company’s fixed maturity securities, equity securities,
    trading securities, short-term investments, derivatives, and
    embedded derivatives along with their fair value hierarchy, are
    described and disclosed in Note 24 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and
    “— Investments.”

Unprecedented credit and equity market conditions have resulted
    in difficulty in valuing certain asset classes due to inactive
    or disorderly markets and less observable market data. See
    “Extraordinary Market Conditions.” Rapidly changing
    market conditions and less liquid markets could materially
    change the valuation of securities within our consolidated
    financial statements and

period-to-period

changes in value could vary significantly. The ultimate value at
    which securities may be sold could differ significantly from the
    valuations reported within the consolidated financial statements
    and could impact our liquidity.

Further, recent events have prompted accounting standard setters
    and law makers to study the definition and application of fair
    value accounting. It appears likely that further disclosures
    regarding the application of, and amounts carried at, fair value
    will be required.

See also “— Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Other.

Based on management’s analysis of
    its expected cash inflows from operating activities, the
    dividends it receives from subsidiaries, that are permitted to
    be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval and its
    portfolio of liquid assets and other anticipated cash flows,
    management believes there will be sufficient liquidity to enable
    the Company to make payments on debt, make cash dividend
    payments on its common and preferred stock, pay all operating
    expenses, and meet its cash needs. The nature of the
    Company’s diverse product portfolio and customer base
    lessens the likelihood that normal operations will result in any
    significant strain on liquidity.

Consolidated Cash Flows.

Net cash provided by
    operating activities increased by $0.8 billion to
    $10.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008 as
    compared to $9.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Cash flows from operations represent net
    income earned adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in
    operating assets and liabilities. The net cash generated from
    operating activities is used to meet the Company’s
    liquidity needs, such as debt and dividend payments, and
    provides cash available for investing activities. Cash flows
    from operations are affected by the timing of receipt of
    premiums and other revenues as well as the payment of the
    Company’s insurance liabilities. In 2008 cash flows from
    operations includes the impact of the Company entering the
    mortgage origination and servicing business.



Net cash provided by operating activities increased by
    $3.3 billion to $9.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to $6.6 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 primarily due to higher net
    investment income and premiums, fees and other revenues.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.2 billion
    and $3.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $2.3 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. In
    2008 the Company reduced securities lending activities in line
    with market conditions, which resulted in a decrease of
    $20.0 billion in the cash collateral received in connection
    with the securities lending program. Partially offsetting this
    decrease was a net increase of $15.8 billion in
    policyholder account balances, which primarily reflected the
    Company’s increased level of funding agreements with the
    FHLB of NY and with MetLife Short Term Funding LLC, an issuer of
    commercial paper (See “Extraordinary Market
    Conditions” and “Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Global Funding Sources”). The Company
    also experienced a $6.9 billion increase in cash collateral
    received under derivatives transactions, primarily as a result
    of the improvement in estimated fair value of the derivatives.
    The cash collateral received under derivatives transactions is
    invested in cash, cash equivalents and other short-term
    investments, which partly explains the major increase in this
    category of liquid assets. The Company increased short-term debt
    by $2.0 billion in 2008 compared with a decrease of
    $0.8 billion in 2007, which primarily reflected new
    activity at MetLife Bank, which borrowed $1.0 billion from
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York under the Term Auction
    Facility and entered into $0.7 billion of short-term
    borrowing from the FHLB of NY in order to fund mortgage
    origination activity acquired by the Company in 2008 and provide
    a cost effective substitute for cash collateral received in
    connection with securities lending. In 2008 the net cash paid
    related to collateral financing arrangements was
    $0.5 billion resulting from the incurrence of price
    returns, which compares to $4.9 billion of cash provided by
    collateral financing arrangement transactions completed in 2007,
    as market conditions in 2008 reduced the availability and
    attractiveness of such financing. In 2008, there was a net
    issuance of $0.7 billion of long-term debt and junior
    subordinated debentures, compared to a net issuance in 2007 of
    $1.1 billion. Finally, in order to strengthen its capital
    base, in 2008 the Company reduced its level of common stock
    repurchase activity by $0.5 billion compared with 2007 only
    repurchasing $1.3 billion of common stock in 2008 as
    compared to $1.8 billion in 2007 and issued $3.3 billion of
    stock compared with no issuance in 2007. The Company also paid
    dividends on the preferred stock and common stock of $0.7
    billion which was comparable to the dividends paid in 2007.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $3.9 billion
    and $15.4 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities decreased by $11.5 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year.
    Net cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily
    because cash collateral received in connection with securities
    lending activity and other transactions was a decrease in cash
    $1.7 billion lower for the year ended December 31,
    2007 as compared to the prior year where cash increased by $11.3
    billion due to an expansion of the securities lending program in
    2006. In 2007 the Company benefited from a $4.0 billion
    increase in cash from the issuance of collateral financing
    arrangements as favorable opportunities to execute such
    transactions arose. Also in 2007, cash provided by the
    Company’s debt financing program decreased to $0.2 billion
    as compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year from
    short-term, long-term and subordinated debt financings as the
    mixture and amount of debt was adjusted in line with the
    Company’s capital structure plans and market opportunities.
    In addition, the Company increased the common stock repurchase
    program to $1.7 billion in 2007 as compared to the prior
    year of $0.5 billion in order to accomplish the Company’s
    capital structure plans. The Company also paid dividends on its
    preferred stock and common stock of $0.7 billion which was
    $0.1 billion higher than prior year reflecting the increase
    in the common stock dividend. The remaining decrease in cash was
    due to slightly lower net flows on policyholder account balances.

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.7 billion and
    $10.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $7.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 as compared to the prior year. The
    Company reduced the level of cash available for investing
    activities in 2008 in order to significantly increase cash and
    cash equivalents as a liquidity cushion in response to the
    deterioration in securities markets in 2008. Cash and cash
    equivalents increased $13.9 billion at December 31,
    2008 compared to the prior year. The net decrease in the amount
    of cash used in investing activities was primarily reflected in
    a decrease in net purchases of fixed maturity and equity
    securities of $15.8 billion and $2.4 billion,
    respectively, as well as a decrease in the net purchases of real
    estate and real estate joint ventures of



$0.5 billion, a decrease in other invested assets of
    $0.5 billion and a decrease of $0.5 billion in the net
    origination of mortgage and consumer loans. In addition, the
    2007 period included the sale of MetLife Australia’s
    annuities and pension businesses of $0.7 billion. These
    decreases in net cash used in investing activities were
    partially offset by an increase in cash invested in short-term
    investments of $11.3 billion due to a repositioning from
    other investment classes due to volatile market conditions, an
    increase in net purchases of other limited partnership interests
    of $0.1 billion and an increase in policy loans of
    $0.3 billion. In addition, the 2008 period includes an
    increase of $0.4 billion of cash used to purchase
    businesses and the decrease of $0.3 billion of cash held by
    a subsidiary, which was split-off from the Company.

Net cash used in investing activities was $10.6 billion and
    $18.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Accordingly, net cash used in investing
    activities decreased by $8.3 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to prior year. In 2007, cash
    available for the purchase of invested assets decreased by
    $11.5 billion as a result of the reduction in cash provided
    by financing activities discussed above. Also, partially
    offsetting this decrease was an increase of $3.3 billion in
    net cash provided by operating activities discussed above. The
    lower amount of cash available for investing activities resulted
    in a decrease in net purchases of fixed maturity securities of
    $15.9 billion, other invested assets of $1.4 billion,
    and a decrease in net origination of mortgage and consumer loans
    of $0.6 billion. This was partially offset by increases in
    the net purchases of real estate and real estate joint ventures
    of $6.3 billion, equity securities of $1.4 billion and
    other limited partnership interests of $0.8 billion. Also,
    there was a decrease in cash provided by short-term investments
    of $0.5 billion. In addition, the 2007 period includes the
    sale of MetLife Australia’s annuities and pension
    businesses and the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in
    MetLife Fubon of $0.7 billion, while the 2006 period
    includes additional consideration paid related to purchases of
    businesses $0.1 billion.

As it relates to cash flows during 2009, the Company anticipates
    it will pay $30 million in dividends on its series A
    and series B preferred shares in March 2009 as
    announced in February, 2009 and the Company received
    $1,035 million in cash in connection with the settlement of
    the stock purchase contracts as described more fully in
    “The Holding Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Remarketing of Junior Subordinated
    Debentures and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.”

Liquidity
    and Capital

Liquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable
    and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and
    future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of
    sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified
    mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale
    financial markets and the ability to borrow through committed
    credit facilities. The Holding Company is an active participant
    in the global financial markets through which it obtains a
    significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as
    cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of the
    Holding Company’s liquidity and capital management.
    Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs,
    prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted
    liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the
    financial markets could limit the Holding Company’s access
    to liquidity. See “Extraordinary Market Conditions.”

The Holding Company’s ability to maintain regular access to
    competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current
    high credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies.
    Management views its capital ratios, credit quality, stable and
    diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and its
    liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining high
    credit ratings. See “The Company —
    Capital — Rating Agencies.”

Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity
    risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid
    asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow
    obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and
    debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on the
    Holding Company’s liquidity.

Liquidity
    and Capital Sources

Dividends.

The primary source of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity is dividends it receives from its
    insurance subsidiaries. The Holding Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the
    payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their
    respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the
    surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding
    calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting
    practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various
    states in which the Company conducts business, differ in certain
    respects from accounting principles used in financial statements
    prepared in conformity with GAAP. The



significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain
    deferred income tax, required investment reserves, reserve
    calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes. Management
    of the Holding Company cannot provide assurances that the
    Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries will have
    statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the
    Holding Company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash
    requirements and pay cash dividends and that the applicable
    insurance departments will not disapprove any dividends that
    such insurance subsidiaries must submit for approval.

The table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid by
    the respective insurance subsidiary without insurance regulatory
    approval and the respective dividends paid:

In the fourth quarter of 2008, MICC declared and paid an
    ordinary dividend of $500 million to the Holding Company.
    In the third quarter of 2008, MLIC used its otherwise ordinary
    dividend capacity through a non-cash dividend in conjunction
    with the RGA split-off as approved by the New York Insurance
    Commissioner.

Under New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount
    of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the
    lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or
    (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital
    gains). MLIC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the
    Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only
    if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend
    and the amount thereof with the Superintendent and the
    Superintendent does not disapprove the distribution within
    30 days of its filing.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, $235 million in
    dividends from other subsidiaries were paid to the Holding
    Company. For the year ended December 31, 2007,
    $190 million in dividends from other subsidiaries were
    paid, of which $176 million were returns of capital, to the
    Holding Company.

Liquid Assets.  A

n integral part of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity management is the amount of liquid
    assets it holds. Liquid assets include cash, cash equivalents,
    short-term investments and publicly-traded securities. Liquid
    assets exclude cash collateral received under the Company’s
    securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash,
    cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded
    securities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Holding
    Company had $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion in liquid
    assets, respectively. At December 31, 2008, the Holding
    Company had pledged $0.8 billion of liquid assets under
    collateral support agreements as described in
    “— Investments — Assets on Deposit,
    Held in Trust and Pledged as Collateral.” The Holding
    Company did not pledge any liquid assets at December 31,
    2007.



Global Funding Sources.

Liquidity is also
    provided by a variety of short-term instruments, including
    commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of long-term
    instruments, including medium- and long-term debt, junior
    subordinated debt securities, collateral financing arrangements,
    capital securities and stockholders’ equity. The diversity
    of the Holding Company’s funding sources enhances funding
    flexibility and limits dependence on any one source of funds and
    generally lowers the cost of funds. Other sources of the Holding
    Company’s liquidity include programs for short-and
    long-term borrowing, as needed.

During this extraordinary market environment, management is
    continuously monitoring and adjusting its liquidity and capital
    plans for the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in light of
    changing needs and opportunities. The dislocation in the credit
    markets has limited the access of financial institutions to
    long-term debt and hybrid capital. While, in general, yields on
    benchmark U.S. Treasury securities were historically low
    during 2008, related spreads on debt instruments, in general,
    and those of financial institutions, specifically, were as high
    as they have been in our history as a public company.

This shift resulted in a relative increase in the cost of new
    debt capital and new credit. For example, in August 2008,
    MetLife remarketed senior unsecured debt with a ten-year
    maturity at a 6.817% coupon. At December 31, 2008, the
    average coupon on ten-year senior unsecured debt of the Holding
    Company, excluding the debt remarketed in August 2008 is 5.4%,
    or 1.4% less than that of the debt remarketed in August 2008.

MetLife has issued $600 million in a single series of
    LIBOR-based preferred stock with a 4% floor. This series
    represents a small portion of MetLife’s fixed charges. At
    current levels, LIBOR would have to increase by 180 basis
    points (over 145% increase) to have any impact on the dividend
    for these preferred securities.

MetLife amended and restated certain of its credit agreements in
    December 2008. These changes included increases in pricing for
    these agreements compared to the original rates.

In February 2009, the Holding Company closed the successful
    remarketing of the Series B portion of the junior
    subordinated debentures underlying the common equity units. The
    Series B junior subordinated debentures were modified as
    permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior debt
    securities, Series B, due February 15, 2019. See
    “— Subsequent Events.” This issuance
    reflects a moderate increase in the Company’s cost of
    borrowing.

MetLife has no current plans to raise additional capital.

The Company is participating in certain economic stabilization
    programs established by various government institutions. See
    “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources.”

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Holding Company had
    $300 million and $310 million in short-term debt
    outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the Holding Company had $7.7 billion and $7.0 billion
    of unaffiliated long-term debt outstanding, respectively. At
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Holding Company had
    $500 million of affiliated long-term debt outstanding,
    respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Holding
    Company had $2.3 billion and $3.4 billion of junior
    subordinated debt securities outstanding. At December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the Holding Company had $2.7 billion and
    $2.4 billion in collateral financing arrangements
    outstanding, respectively.

In November 2007, the Holding Company filed a shelf registration
    statement (the “2007 Registration Statement”) with the
    SEC, which was automatically effective upon filing, in
    accordance with SEC rules which also allow for pay-as-you-go
    fees and the ability to add securities by filing automatically
    effective amendment for companies, such as the Holding Company,
    which qualify as “Well-Known Seasoned Issuers.” The
    2007 Registration Statement registered an unlimited amount of
    debt and equity securities and supersedes the shelf registration
    statement that the Holding Company filed in April 2005. The
    terms of any offering will be established at the time of the
    offering.

Debt Issuances.

As described more fully in
    “Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debentures and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts” the Holding Company
    sold senior notes in August 2008 and February 2009.

As described more fully in “The Company
    — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Debt
    Issuances,” during April 2008, Trust X issued 2008
    Trust Securities with a face amount of $750 million,
    and a fixed rate of interest of 9.25% up to, but not including,
    April 8, 2038, the scheduled redemption date. The
    beneficial interest in Trust X held by the



Holding Company is not represented by an investment in
    Trust X but rather by a financing agreement between the
    Holding Company and Trust X. The assets of Trust X are
    $750 million of 8.595% surplus notes of MICC, which are
    scheduled to mature April 8, 2038, and rights under the
    financing agreement. Under the financing agreement, the Holding
    Company has the obligation to make payments
    (i) semiannually at a fixed rate of 0.655% of the surplus
    notes outstanding and owned by Trust X or if greater
    (ii) equal to the difference between the 2008
    Trust Securities interest payment and the interest received
    by Trust X on the surplus notes. The ability of MICC to
    make interest and principal payments on the surplus notes to the
    Trust is contingent upon regulatory approval. The 2008
    Trust Securities will be exchanged into a like amount of
    Holding Company junior subordinated debentures on April 8,
    2038, the scheduled redemption date; mandatorily under certain
    circumstances; and at any time upon the Holding Company
    exercising its option to redeem the securities. The 2008
    Trust Securities will be exchanged for junior subordinated
    debentures prior to repayment and the Holding Company is
    ultimately responsible for repayment of the junior subordinated
    debentures. The Holding Company’s other rights and
    obligations as it relates to the deferral of interest,
    redemption, replacement capital obligation and RCC associated
    with the issuance of the 2008 Trust Securities are more
    fully described in “The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Debt Issuances.”

During December 2007, Trust IV issued 2007
    Trust Securities with a face amount of $700 million
    and a discount of $6 million ($694 million) and a
    fixed rate of interest of 7.875% up to, but not including,
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date. The
    beneficial interest of Trust IV held by the Holding Company
    is not represented by an investment in Trust IV but rather
    by a financing agreement between the Holding Company and
    Trust IV. The assets of Trust IV are $700 million
    of 7.375% surplus notes of MLIC, which are scheduled to mature
    December 15, 2037, and rights under the financing
    agreement. Under the financing agreement, the Holding Company
    has the obligation to make payments (i) semiannually at a
    fixed rate of 0.50% of the surplus notes outstanding and owned
    by Trust IV or if greater (ii) equal to the difference
    between the 2007 Trust Securities interest payment and the
    interest received by Trust IV on the surplus notes. The
    ability of MLIC to make interest and principal payments on the
    surplus notes to the Holding Company is contingent upon
    regulatory approval. The 2007 Trust Securities, will be
    exchanged into a like amount of Holding Company junior
    subordinated debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled
    redemption date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at
    any time upon the Holding Company exercising its option to
    redeem the securities. The 2007 Trust Securities will be
    exchanged for junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment
    and the Holding Company is ultimately responsible for repayment
    of the junior subordinated debentures. The Holding
    Company’s other rights and obligations as it relates to the
    deferral of interest, redemption, replacement capital obligation
    and RCC associated with the issuance of the
    Trust Securities are more fully described in “The
    Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources —
    Debt Issuances.”

As described more fully in “The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Debt Issuances”:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under which
    the Holding Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on
    the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly.

Under this agreement, the Holding Company may also be required
    to pledge collateral or make payments to the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to any decline in the estimated
    fair value of the surplus notes and in connection with any early
    termination of this agreement. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company paid
    $800 million to the unaffiliated financial institution
    related to a decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus
    notes. This payment reduced the amount under the agreement on
    which the Holding Company’s interest payment is due but did
    not reduce the outstanding amount of the surplus notes. In
    addition, the Holding Company had pledged collateral of
    $230 million to the unaffiliated financial institution at
    December 31, 2008. No collateral was pledged at
    December 31, 2007. The Holding Company’s net cost of
    0.57% has been allocated to MRC. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, this amount was $14 million. For
    the year ended December 31, 2007 this amount was immaterial.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated



financial institution under which the Holding Company is
    entitled to the return on the investment portfolio held by a
    trust established in connection with this collateral financing
    arrangement in exchange for the payment of a stated rate of
    return to the unaffiliated financial institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may
    also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the fair value of the assets held by the trust, as well as
    amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination of the
    collateral financing arrangement. As a result of this agreement,
    the Holding Company effectively assumed the $2.4 billion
    liability under the collateral financing agreement along with a
    beneficial interest in the trust holding the associated assets.
    The Holding Company simultaneously contributed to MRSC its
    beneficial interest in the trust, along with any return to be
    received on the investment portfolio held by the trust. For the
    year ended December 31, 2008, the Holding Company paid
    $320 million to the unaffiliated financial institution as a
    result of the decline in the fair value of the assets in the
    trust. All of the $320 million was deposited into the
    trust. In January 2009, the Holding Company paid an additional
    $360 million to the unaffiliated financial institution as a
    result of the continued decline in the fair value of the assets
    in trust which was also deposited into the trust. In addition,
    the Holding Company may be required to pledge collateral to the
    unaffiliated financial institution under this agreement. At
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company had pledged
    $86 million under the agreement. No collateral had been
    pledged under the agreement as December 31, 2007. Interest
    expense incurred by the Holding Company under the collateral
    financing arrangement for the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007 was $107 million and $84 million,
    respectively. The allocation of these financing costs to MRSC is
    included in other revenues and recorded as an additional
    investment in MRSC.

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. See
    “The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Debt Issuances” for further information.

In September 2006, the Holding Company issued $204 million
    of affiliated long-term debt with an interest rate of 6.07%
    maturing in 2016.

In March 2006, the Holding Company issued $10 million of
    affiliated long-term debt with an interest rate of 5.70%
    maturing in 2016.

Credit Facilities.

The Holding Company and
    MetLife Funding entered into a $2,850 million credit
    agreement with various financial institutions, the proceeds of
    which are available to be used for general



corporate purposes, to support their commercial paper programs
    and for the issuance of letters of credit. All borrowings under
    the credit agreement must be repaid by June 2012, except that
    letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain
    outstanding until June 2013. The borrowers and the lenders under
    this facility may agree to extend the term of all or part of the
    facility to no later than June 2014, except that letters of
    credit outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until
    June 2015. Total fees associated with these credit facilities
    were $17 million, of which $11 million related to
    deferred amendment fees for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

At December 31, 2008, $2.3 billion of letters of
    credit have been issued under these unsecured credit facilities
    on behalf of the Holding Company.

Management has no reason to believe that its lending
    counterparties are unable to fulfill their respective
    contractual obligations. See “— The Company
    — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Credit
    Facilities.”

Committed Facilities.

The Holding Company
    maintains committed facilities aggregating $11.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008. When drawn upon, these facilities bear
    interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective
    agreements as specified below. The facilities are used for
    collateral for certain of the Company’s insurance
    liabilities. Management has no reason to believe that its
    lending counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual
    obligations. See “— The Company —
    Liquidity and Capital Sources — Committed
    Facilities.”

Total fees associated with these committed facilities were
    $35 million, of which $13 million related to deferred
    amendment fees, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2008,
    the Holding Company had outstanding $2.8 billion in letters
    of credit from various financial institutions, of which
    $500 million and $2.3 billion were part of committed
    and credit facilities, respectively. As commitments associated
    with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire
    unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the Holding
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.

Covenants.

Certain of the Holding
    Company’s debt instruments, credit facilities and committed
    facilities contain various administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants. The Holding Company believes it is in
    compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debentures and Settlement
    of Stock Purchase Contracts.

On August 15,
    2008, the Holding Company closed the successful remarketing of
    the Series A portion of the junior subordinated debentures
    underlying the common equity units. The Series A junior
    subordinated debentures were modified as permitted by their
    terms to be 6.817% senior debt securities Series A,
    due August 15, 2018. The Holding Company did not receive
    any proceeds from the remarketing. Most common equity unit
    holders chose to have their junior subordinated debentures
    remarketed and used the remarketing proceeds to settle their
    payment obligations under the applicable stock purchase
    contract. For those common equity unit holders that elected not
    to participate in the remarketing and elected to use their own
    cash to satisfy the payment obligations under the stock purchase
    contract, the terms of the debt are the same as the remarketed
    debt. The initial settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    occurred on August 15, 2008, providing proceeds to the
    Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 20,244,549 shares of its common stock held in
    treasury at a value of $1,064 million to settle the stock
    purchase contracts.

On February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series B portion of the
    junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity
    units. The Series B junior subordinated debentures were
    modified as permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior
    debt securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debentures remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt. The subsequent
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts occurred on
    February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the Holding
    Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock to settle the stock purchase contracts. See —
    “Subsequent Events.”



Common Stock Issuance.

On October 8,
    2008, the Holding Company issued 86,250,000 shares of its
    common stock at a price of $26.50 per share for gross proceeds
    of $2.3 billion. Of the shares issued,
    75,000,000 shares were issued from treasury stock.

Preferred Stock.

During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company issued no new
    preferred stock. In December 2008, the Holding Company entered
    into a replacement capital covenant (the “Replacement
    Capital Covenant”) whereby the Company agreed for the
    benefit of holders of one or more series of the Company’s
    unsecured long-term indebtedness designated from time to time by
    the Company in accordance with the terms of the Replacement
    Capital Covenant (“Covered Debt”), that the Company
    will not repay, redeem or purchase and will cause its
    subsidiaries not to repay, redeem or purchase, on or before the
    termination of the Replacement Capital Covenant on
    December 31, 2018 (or earlier termination by agreement of
    the holders of Covered Debt or when there is no longer any
    outstanding series of unsecured long-term indebtedness which
    qualifies for designation as “Covered Debt”), the
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, of
    the Company or the 6.500% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock,
    Series B, of the Company, unless such repayment, redemption
    or purchase is made from the proceeds of the issuance of certain
    replacement capital securities and pursuant to the other terms
    and conditions set forth in the Replacement Capital Covenant.

Liquidity
    and Capital Uses

The primary uses of liquidity of the Holding Company include
    debt service, cash dividends on common and preferred stock,
    capital contributions to subsidiaries, payment of general
    operating expenses, acquisitions and the repurchase of the
    Holding Company’s common stock.

Future common stock dividend decisions will be determined by the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors after taking into
    consideration factors such as the Company’s current
    earnings, expected medium- and long-term earnings, financial
    condition, regulatory capital position, and applicable
    governmental regulations and policies. Furthermore, the payment
    of dividends and other distributions to the Holding Company by
    its insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and
    regulations.

Share Repurchases.

In October 2004, the
    Holding Company’s Board of Directors authorized a
    $1 billion common stock repurchase program. In February
    2007, the Holding Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase program.
    In September 2007, the Holding Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase
    program which began after the completion of the $1 billion
    common stock repurchase program authorized in February 2007. In
    January 2008, the Holding Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized an additional $1 billion common stock repurchase
    program, which began after the completion of the September 2007
    program. Under these authorizations, the Holding Company may
    purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust,
    in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set
    trading plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act and in privately negotiated transactions).



In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Holding Company entered into the

    Company’s common stock to the Holding Company resulting in

    purchased the common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. Also, in November 2007, the Holding Company
    received a cash adjustment of $19 million based on the
    trading price of the common stock during the repurchase period,
    for a final purchase price of $731 million. The Holding
    Company recorded the shares initially repurchased as treasury
    stock and recorded the amount received as an adjustment to the

    the common stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties
    and purchased common stock in the open market to return to such
    third parties. In June 2007, the Holding Company paid a cash
    adjustment of $17 million for a final purchase price of
    $767 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

•

In December 2006, the Holding Company repurchased
    3,993,024 shares of its outstanding common stock at an
    aggregate cost of $232 million under an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed
    the common stock sold to the Holding Company from third parties
    and purchased the common stock in the open market to return to
    such third parties. In February 2007, the Holding Company paid a
    cash adjustment of $8 million for a final purchase price of
    $240 million. The Holding Company recorded the shares
    initially repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount
    paid as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

In connection with the split-off of RGA as described in
    Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock with a
    net book value of $1,716 million resulting in a loss on
    disposition, including transaction costs, of $458 million.

The Company also repurchased 1,550,000 and 3,171,700 shares
    through open market purchases for $88 million and
    $200 million, respectively, during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Cumulatively, the Company repurchased 21,266,418, 26,626,824 and
    8,608,824 shares of its common stock for
    $1,250 million, $1,705 million and $500 million
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, 97,515,737, 3,864,894 and 3,056,559 shares
    of common stock were issued from treasury stock for
    $5,221 million, $172 million and



$102 million, respectively. In addition, 11,250,000 new
    shares were issued during the year ended December 31, 2008
    in connection with the October 2008 common stock offering.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $216 million
    remaining on the October 2004 common stock repurchase program
    which was subsequently reduced by $8 million to
    $208 million after the February 2007 cash adjustment to the
    December 2006 accelerated common stock repurchase agreement. The
    February 2007 stock repurchase program authorization was fully
    utilized during 2007. At December 31, 2007,
    $511 million remained on the Company’s September 2007
    common stock repurchase program. The $511 million remaining
    on the September 2007 common stock repurchase program was
    reduced by $450 million to $61 million upon settlement
    of the accelerated stock repurchase agreement executed during
    December 2007 but for which no settlement occurred until January
    2008. Subsequent to the April 2008 authorization, the amount
    remaining under these repurchase programs was
    $1,261 million.

Future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several
    factors, including the Company’s capital position, its
    financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions
    and the price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock. The Company
    does not intend to make any purchases under the common stock
    repurchase program in 2009.

Support Agreements.

In October 2007, the
    Holding Company, in connection with MRV’s reinsurance of
    certain universal life and term life insurance risks, committed
    to the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and
    Health Care Administration to take necessary action to cause
    each of the two initial protected cells of MRV to maintain total
    adjusted capital equal to or greater than 200% of such protected
    cell’s authorized control level risk-based capital
    (“RBC”), as defined in state insurance statutes. This
    transaction is more fully described in Note 10, Long-term
    and Short-term Debt, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. See “The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Committed Facilities.”

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of a portion of the liabilities associated with the
    closed block, committed to the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance to make capital contributions, if necessary, to MRC so
    that MRC may at all times maintain its total adjusted capital at
    a level of not less than 200% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes as in
    effect on the date of determination or December 31, 2007,
    whichever calculation produces the greater capital requirement,
    or as otherwise required by the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance. This collateral financing arrangement is more fully
    described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. See “The Company
    — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Debt
    Issuances.”

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to cause MRSC to maintain total adjusted capital equal to
    the greater of $250,000 or 100% of MRSC’s authorized
    control level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes.
    This collateral financing arrangement is more fully described in
    Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. See “The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Debt Issuances.”

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by
    state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it
    to meet its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSMIC
    to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for MSMIC to
    maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as calculated in
    accordance with the Insurance Business Law of Japan, and to make
    such loans to MSMIC as may be necessary to ensure that MSMIC has
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment
    obligations as they fall due.



The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter Reassurance Company, Ltd., under a
    reinsurance agreement with MSMIC, under which Exeter reinsures
    variable annuity business written MSMIC.

Management anticipates that to the extent that these
    arrangements place significant demands upon the Holding Company,
    there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the
    Holding Company to meet these demands.

Based on management’s analysis and comparison of its
    current and future cash inflows from the dividends it receives
    from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior
    insurance regulatory approval, its asset portfolio and other
    cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets,
    management believes there will be sufficient liquidity and
    capital to enable the Holding Company to make payments on debt,
    make cash dividend payments on its common and preferred stock,
    contribute capital to its subsidiaries, pay all operating
    expenses and meet its cash needs.

Holding Company Cash Flows.

Net cash provided
    by operating activities, primarily the result of subsidiary
    dividends, was similar at $1.2 billion for the years ending
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The net cash generated from
    operating activities was used to meet the Holding Company’s
    liquidity and capital needs such as debt servicing, dividend
    payments, capital contributions to subsidiaries, stock buybacks
    and acquisitions, as well as other corporate uses.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by
    $2.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006
    primarily due to $3.0 billion lower dividends from
    subsidiaries. The 2006 operating activities included
    $2.2 billion of extraordinary dividends in conjunction with
    the sale of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $50 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $2.9 billion of net cash used for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities increased by $2.9 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year. In
    2008 net cash paid related to collateral financing
    arrangements was $800 million resulting from the incurrence
    of price return payments compared to zero outflows for this
    purpose in 2007. Finally, in order to strengthen its capital
    base, in 2008 the Holding Company reduced its level of common
    stock repurchase activity by $500 million compared to the
    prior year and issued $3.3 billion of common stock compared
    with zero issuance in 2007.

Net cash used by financing activities was $2.9 billion for
    the years ended December 31, 2007, compared to
    $239 million of net cash provided for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    financing activities decreased by $3.1 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year
    primarily due to increased stock repurchase of $1.2 billion
    and a net decrease in debt issuance of $748 million.
    Financing activity results are the result of the Holding
    Company’s debt and equity financing activities, as well as
    changes due to the needs of securities lending and collateral
    financing arrangements.

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.2 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $742 million provided for the year ended December 31,
    2007. Accordingly, net cash provided by investing activities
    decreased by $1.9 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year primarily due
    to increases in capital contributions to subsidiaries and
    changes in short-term investments.

Net cash provided by investing activities was $742 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
    $2.8 billion of net cash used for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Accordingly, net cash provided by
    investing activities increased by $3.5 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the prior year
    primarily due to a decrease in net purchases of fixed maturity
    securities. Investing activity results are generally due to the
    Holding Company’s management of its capital, as well as the
    needs of its subsidiaries and any business development
    opportunities.

As it relates to cash flows during 2009, the Holding Company
    anticipates it will pay $30 million in dividends on its
    Series A and Series B preferred shares in March 2009
    as announced in February 2009 and the Holding Company received
    $1,035 million in cash in connection with the settlement of
    the stock purchase contracts as described more fully in
    “Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debentures and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts.”



Subsequent
    Events

Dividends

On February 18, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    announced dividends of $0.25 per share, for a total of
    $6 million, on its Series A preferred shares, and
    $0.40625 per share, for a total of $24 million, on its
    Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 5, 2009,
    the earliest date permitted in accordance with the terms of the
    securities. Both dividends will be payable March 16, 2009
    to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2009.

Remarketing
    of Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts
    Underlying Common Equity Units

On February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series B portion of the
    junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity
    units. The junior subordinated debentures were modified as
    permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior debt
    securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debentures remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt.

The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    occurred on February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the
    Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock to settle the remaining stock purchase contracts issued as
    part of the common equity units sold in June 2005.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. The
    amounts of these unfunded commitments were $4.5 billion and
    $4.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Once funded, those commitments are classified in the
    consolidated balance sheet according to their nature as other
    limited partnership interests, real estate joint ventures or
    other invested assets. The Company anticipates that these
    amounts will be invested in partnerships over the next five
    years. There are no other obligations or liabilities arising
    from such arrangements that are reasonably likely to become
    material.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company intends
    to sell the majority of these originated residential mortgage
    loans. Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans
    that will be held-for-sale are considered derivatives pursuant
    to SFAS 133, and their estimated fair value and notional
    amounts are included within financial forwards in the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be held-for-investment. The
    amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $2.7 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The purpose of these loans is to
    enhance the Company’s total return on its investment
    portfolio. There are no other obligations or liabilities arising
    from such arrangements that are reasonably likely to become
    material.

The purpose of the Company’s loan program is to enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio. There
    are no other obligations or liabilities arising from such
    arrangements that are reasonably likely to become material.



Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.0 billion and
    $1.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The purpose of these commitments and any related
    fundings is to enhance the Company’s total return on its
    investment portfolio. There are no other obligations or
    liabilities arising from such arrangements that are reasonably
    likely to become material.

Lease
    Commitments

The Company, as lessee, has entered into various lease and
    sublease agreements for office space, data processing and other
    equipment. The Company’s commitments under such lease
    agreements are included within the contractual obligations
    table. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Investment and Other.”

Credit
    Facilities, Committed Facilities and Letters of
    Credit

The Company maintains committed and unsecured credit facilities
    and letters of credit with various financial institutions. See
    “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    The Company — Liquidity and Capital
    Sources — Credit Facilities,”
    “— Committed Facilities” and
    “— Letters of Credit” for further
    descriptions of such arrangements.

Share-Based
    Arrangements

In connection with the issuance of common equity units, the
    Holding Company issued forward stock purchase contracts under
    which the Holding Company delivered 44,587,703 shares of
    its common stock in settlements of the stock purchase contracts.
    In February 2009, 24,343,154 shares of common stock were
    delivered. See “— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Sources — Remarketing of Securities and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts Underlying Common Equity
    Units” for further information.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities and guarantees that are triggered by, among other
    things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
    provided by the Company. In addition, in the normal course of
    business, the Company provides indemnifications to
    counterparties in contracts with triggers similar to the
    foregoing, as well as for certain other liabilities, such as
    third party lawsuits. These obligations are often subject to
    time limitations that vary in duration, including contractual
    limitations and those that arise by operation of law, such as
    applicable statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum
    potential obligation under the indemnities and guarantees is
    subject to a contractual limitation ranging from less than
    $1 million to $800 million, with a cumulative maximum
    of $1.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are
    not specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations
    are not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe
    that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    that could become due under these guarantees in the future.
    Management believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to
    make any material payments under these indemnities, guarantees,
    or commitments.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.



During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recorded $7 million of additional liabilities for
    guarantees related to certain investment transactions. The term
    for these guarantees and their associated liabilities varies,
    with a maximum of 18 years. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments the Company could be required to pay under these
    guarantees is $202 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company reduced $7 million of
    previously recorded liabilities related to indemnifications
    provided in connection with the disposition of real estate
    property and other investment transactions. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities were $6 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 for indemnities, guarantees and
    commitments.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in
    exchange for the referenced credit obligation. If a credit
    event, as defined by the contract, occurs the Company’s
    maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced
    credit obligations is zero, was $1.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008. However, the Company believes that any
    actual future losses will be significantly lower than this
    amount. Additionally, the Company can terminate these contracts
    at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an
    amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the
    credit default swaps. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    would have paid $37 million to terminate all of these
    contracts.

Other
    Commitments

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut is a member of the
    Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the “FHLB of
    Boston”) and holds $70 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of Boston at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, which is
    included in equity securities. MICC has also entered into
    funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has
    issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of Boston has been granted a blanket lien on
    certain MICC assets, including residential mortgage-backed
    securities, to collateralize MICC’s obligations under the
    funding agreements. MICC maintains control over these pledged
    assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any
    portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MICC’s liability to
    the FHLB of Boston. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was
    $526 million and $726 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, which is included in policyholder
    account balances. In addition, at December 31, 2008, MICC
    had advances of $300 million from the FHLB of Boston with
    original maturities of less than one year and therefore, such
    advances are included in short-term debt. These advances and the
    advances on these funding agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $1.3 billion and $901 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a member of the FHLB of
    NY and holds $830 million and $339 million of common
    stock of the FHLB of NY at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, which is included in equity securities. MLIC has
    also entered into funding agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MLIC has issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and
    for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC
    assets, including residential mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MLIC’s obligations under the funding
    agreements. MLIC maintains control over these pledged assets,
    and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of
    the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the
    remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the
    collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC,
    the FHLB of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to
    the amount of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The
    amount of the Company’s liability for funding agreements
    with the FHLB of NY was $15.2 billion and $4.6 billion
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is
    included in policyholder account balances. The advances on these
    agreements are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities with
    estimated fair values of $17.8 billion and
    $4.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

MetLife Bank is a member of the FHLB of NY and holds
    $89 million and $64 million of common stock of the
    FHLB of NY at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively,
    which is included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also
    entered into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MetLife Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for
    cash and for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket
    lien on MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages and
    mortgage-backed securities to collateralize MetLife Bank’s
    obligations under the repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank
    maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use,
    commingle,



encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as
    there is no event of default and the remaining qualified
    collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance
    level. The repurchase agreements and the related security
    agreement represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any
    event of default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery
    is limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under
    the outstanding repurchase agreements. The amount of the
    Company’s liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB
    of NY was $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt and short-term debt depending on the original
    tenor of the advance. The advances on these repurchase
    agreements are collateralized by residential mortgage-backed
    securities and residential mortgage loans with estimated fair
    values of $3.1 billion and $1.3 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Collateral
    for Securities Lending

The Company has non-cash collateral for securities lending on
    deposit from customers, which cannot be sold or repledged, and
    which has not been recorded on its consolidated balance sheets.
    The amount of this collateral was $279 million and
    $40 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. Impairment testing is performed using the fair
    value approach, which requires the use of estimates and
    judgment, at the “reporting unit” level. A reporting
    unit is the operating segment or a business one level below the
    operating segment, if discrete financial information is prepared
    and regularly reviewed by management at that level.

The allocation of the goodwill to the reporting units is
    performed at the time of the respective acquisition. The
    $470 million of goodwill within Corporate & Other
    relates to goodwill acquired as a part of the Travelers
    acquisition of $405 million, as well as acquisitions by
    MetLife Bank which resides within Corporate & Other.
    For purposes of goodwill impairment testing at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, $405 million of Corporate & Other
    goodwill has been attributed to the Individual and Institutional
    segment reporting units. The Individual segment was attributed
    $210 million, (traditional life —
    $23 million, variable & universal
    life — $11 million and annuities —
    $176 million) and the Institutional segment was attributed
    $195 million, (group life — $2 million,
    retirement & savings — $186 million,
    and non-medical health & other —
    $7 million) at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated
    fair value, there is an indication of impairment, and the
    implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same
    manner as the amount of goodwill would be determined in a
    business acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of
    goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized
    as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.
    The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests
    during the third quarter of 2008 based upon data as of
    June 30, 2008. Such tests indicated that goodwill was not
    impaired as of September 30, 2008. Current economic
    conditions, the sustained low level of equity markets, declining
    market capitalizations in the insurance industry and lower
    operating earnings projections, particularly for the Individual
    segment, required management of the Company to consider the
    impact of these events on the recoverability of its assets, in
    particular its goodwill. Management concluded it was appropriate
    to perform an interim goodwill impairment test at
    December 31, 2008. Based upon the tests performed
    management concluded no impairment of goodwill had occurred for
    any of the Company’s reporting units at December 31,
    2008.



In performing its goodwill impairment tests, when management
    believes meaningful comparable market data are available, the
    estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined
    using a market multiple approach. When relevant comparables are
    not available, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model.
    For reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market
    assumptions, such as the annuities and variable &
    universal life reporting units within the Individual segment,
    the Company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using
    additional valuation methodologies.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value include projected operating
    earnings, current book value (with and without accumulated other
    comprehensive income), the level of economic capital required to
    support the mix of business, long term growth rates, comparative
    market multiples, the account value of our in-force business,
    projections of new and renewal business as well as margins on
    such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity market levels, and the discount rate management believes
    appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of the annuity and
    variable & universal life reporting units are
    particularly sensitive to the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, management also considers
    its market capitalization in relation to its book value.
    Management believes that the overall decrease in the
    Company’s current market capitalization is not
    representative of a long-term decrease in the value of the
    underlying reporting units.

Management applies significant judgment when determining the
    estimated fair value of its reporting units and when assessing
    the relationship of its market capitalization to the estimated
    fair value of its reporting units and their book value. The
    valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments
    and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair
    value are inherently uncertain and represent only
    management’s reasonable expectation regarding future
    developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions
    upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood,
    differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in
    the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units
    could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which
    could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations or financial position.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Continued deteriorating or adverse market conditions for
    certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the
    estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result
    in future impairments of goodwill.

Pensions
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Description
    of Plans

Plan
    Description Overview

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (“the
    Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and either final average or career average
    earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts, which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2008, the majority of active participants are
    accruing benefits under the cash balance formula; however,
    approximately 95% of the Subsidiaries’ obligations result
    from benefits calculated with the traditional formula. The
    non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits, in
    excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to certain
    executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.



Financial
    Summary

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, establishes the
    accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87, the
    projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarial present value of vested and non-vested
    pension benefits accrued based on future salary levels. The
    accumulated pension benefit obligation (“ABO”) is the
    actuarial present value of vested and non-vested pension
    benefits accrued based on current salary levels. The PBO and ABO
    of the pension plans are set forth in the following section.

Prior to December 31, 2006, SFAS 87 also required the
    recognition of an additional minimum pension liability and an
    intangible asset (limited to unrecognized prior service cost) if
    the estimated fair value of pension plan assets was less than
    the ABO at the measurement date. The excess of the additional
    minimum pension liability over the allowable intangible asset
    was charged, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s additional
    minimum pension liability was $78 million, and the
    intangible asset was $12 million, at December 31,
    2005. The excess of the additional minimum pension liability
    over the intangible asset of $66 million ($41 million,
    net of income tax) was recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s additional minimum pension liability was
    $92 million. The additional minimum pension liability of
    $59 million, net of income tax of $33 million, was
    recorded as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive
    income.

SFAS No. 106,

Employers Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,

as amended,
    (“SFAS 106”), establishes the accounting for
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike the PBO for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligation (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement
    benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a
    particular date. The APBO is recorded in the financial
    statements and is set forth below.

As described more fully in “— Adoption of New
    Accounting Pronouncements,” the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans

—

an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS 158”), effective December 31,
    2006. Upon adoption, the Company was required to recognize in
    the consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Funded
    status is measured as the difference between the estimated fair
    value of plan assets and the benefit obligation, which is the
    PBO for pension plans and the APBO for other postretirement
    benefit plans. The change to recognize funded status eliminated
    the additional minimum pension liability provisions of
    SFAS 87. In addition, the Company recognized as an
    adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net
    of income tax, those amounts of actuarial gains and losses,
    prior service costs and credits, and the remaining net
    transition asset or obligation that had not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit cost at the date of adoption. The adoption
    of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of $744 million,
    net of income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), which is included as a component of total consolidated



stockholders’ equity. The following table summarizes the
    adjustments to the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit pension
    plans are determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine
    the present value of future benefit payments, the expected rate
    of compensation increases and average expected retirement age.

Assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as
    follows:

December 31,



Weighted average discount rate

6.60%

6.65%

Rate of compensation increase

3.5% - 7.5%

3.5% - 8%

Average expected retirement age



The discount rate is determined annually based on the yield,
    measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio
    constructed of high-quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate PBO when due. The yield of this
    hypothetical portfolio, constructed of bonds rated AA or better
    by Moody’s resulted in a discount rate of approximately
    6.60% and 6.65% for the defined pension plans at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.



A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the PBO. This increase (decrease) to the PBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2008 PBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the PBO of $168 million.

At the end of 2008, total net actuarial losses were
    $2,184 million as compared to $623 million in 2007. In
    2008, the decrease in discount rate had a nominal effect on the
    increase in the actuarial losses. The substantial increase in
    net actuarial losses during 2008 occurred due to the substantial
    decline in the estimated fair value of plan assets. These losses
    will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the average
    remaining service period of active employees expected to receive
    benefits under the benefit plans. At the end of 2008, the
    average remaining service period of active employees was
    7.9 years for the pension plans. The increase in net
    periodic benefit cost in 2009 associated with the amortization
    of these net actuarial losses is described in the respective
    section which follows.

As the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are
    calculated as a percentage of future earnings, an assumption of
    future compensation increases is required to determine the
    projected benefit obligation. This assumption is based on a
    building block approach that best-estimates future compensation
    increases due to inflation, merit and productivity. The future
    compensation rate is derived from a Consumer Price Index
    (“CPI”) assumption and through periodic analysis of
    historical demographic data conducted. A recent review of these
    underlying assumptions demonstrated that the CPI assumption
    should be lowered by 50 basis points based on forecasts
    from various economic reports. The last review of the historical
    data was conducted using salary information through 2006 and the
    Company believes that no circumstances have subsequently
    occurred that would result in a material change to the future
    compensation rate. The 50 basis point change in future
    compensation rate caused a decrease in PBO of $62 million.
    This rate is reviewed annually.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

The APBO is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions,
    from which actual results may vary. Some of the more significant
    of these assumptions include the discount rate, the healthcare
    cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age. The
    determination of the discount rate and the average expected
    retirement age are substantially consistent with the
    determination described previously for the pension plans.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-Medicare eligible claims

8.8% down to 5.8% in 2018 and

8.5% down to 5% in 2014 and

gradually decreasing  until 2079

remaining constant  thereafter

reaching the ultimate rate of 4.1%

Medicare eligible claims

8.8% down to 5.8% in 2018 and

10.5% down to 5% in 2018 and

gradually decreasing  until 2079

remaining constant thereafter

reaching the ultimate rate of 4.1%

A recent review of the healthcare cost trend assumption
    indicated the need for a slight modification in this assumption
    as set forth in the table above. This assumption change in our
    healthcare cost trend rate increased the APBO by
    $62 million. This rate is reviewed annually.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. A
    one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend
    rates would have the following effects:

$

(86

)

A decrease (increase) in the discount rate increases (decreases)
    the APBO. This increase (decrease) to the APBO is amortized into
    earnings as an actuarial loss (gain). Based on the
    December 31, 2008 APBO, a 25 basis point decrease
    (increase) in the discount rate would result in an increase
    (decrease) in the APBO of $44 million.



At the end of 2008, total net actuarial losses were
    $147 million as compared to net actuarial gains of
    $112 million in 2007. In 2008, the decrease in discount
    rate had a nominal effect on the increase in the actuarial
    losses. The increase in net actuarial losses during 2008
    occurred due to the substantial decline in the estimated fair
    value of plan assets. These losses will be amortized on a
    straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
    active employees expected to receive benefits under the other
    postretirement benefit plans. At the end of 2008, the average
    remaining service period of active employees was 7.9 years
    for the other postretirement benefit plans. The increase in net
    periodic benefit cost in 2009 associated with the amortization
    of these net actuarial losses is described in the respective
    section which follows.

In 2004, the Company adopted the guidance in Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position
    (“FSP”)

No. 106-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of

(“FSP 106-2”),

to account for future subsidies to be received under the
    Prescription Drug Act. The Company began receiving these
    subsidies during 2006. A summary of the reduction to the APBO
    and related reduction to the components of net periodic other

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Pension
    Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the pension plans are invested
    within group annuity and life insurance contracts issued by the
    Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in separate
    accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account values of
    assets held with the Subsidiaries were $5,502 million and
    $6,440 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all
    material respects with those the Subsidiaries offer to
    unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

Net assets invested in separate accounts are stated at the
    aggregate estimated fair value of units of participation. Such
    value reflects accumulated contributions, dividends and realized
    and unrealized investment gains or losses apportioned to such
    contributions, less withdrawals, distributions, allocable
    expenses relating to the purchase, sale and maintenance of the
    assets and an allocable part of such separate accounts’
    investment expenses.



Separate account investments in fixed income and equity
    securities are generally carried at published market value, or
    if published market values are not readily available, at
    estimated fair values. Investments in short-term fixed income
    securities are generally reflected as cash equivalents and
    carried at fair value. Real estate investments, in the form of
    real estate investment trusts, are carried at estimated fair
    value based on appraisals performed by third-party real estate
    appraisal firms, and generally, determined by discounting
    projected cash flows over periods of time and at interest rates
    deemed appropriate for each investment. Information on the
    physical value of the property and the sales prices of
    comparable properties is used to corroborate fair value
    estimates. Estimated fair value of hedge fund net assets is
    generally determined by third-party pricing vendors using quoted
    market prices or through the use of pricing models which are
    affected by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates, financial indices, credit spreads, market supply and
    demand, market volatility and liquidity.

The following table summarizes the actual and target
    weighted-average allocations of pension plan assets within the
    separate accounts:

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective
    of maximizing returns and minimizing volatility of net assets
    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions.

Credit and equity market volatility during 2008 resulted in a
    substantial decrease in the estimated fair value of the pension
    plan’s assets at December 31, 2008. This decline in
    asset values resulted in a substantial increase in net actuarial
    losses at December 31, 2008, as described in the preceding
    section on pension plan obligations, and will result in a
    significant increase in net periodic pension cost during 2009,
    as described in the following section on net periodic benefit
    cost.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets

Substantially all assets of the other postretirement benefit
    plans are invested within life insurance and reserve contracts
    issued by the Subsidiaries. The majority of assets are held in
    separate accounts established by the Subsidiaries. The account
    values of assets held with the Subsidiaries were
    $949 million and $1,125 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The terms of these contracts are
    consistent in all material respects with those the Subsidiaries
    offer to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

The valuation of separate accounts and the investments within
    such separate accounts invested in by the other postretirement
    benefit plans are similar to that described in the preceding
    section on pension plans.

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective

    economic factors and market conditions.

Credit and equity market volatility during 2008 resulted in a
    decrease in the estimated fair value of the other postretirement
    benefit plan’s assets at December 31, 2008. This
    decline in asset values resulted in an increase in net actuarial
    losses at December 31, 2008, as described in the preceding
    section on other postretirement benefit plan obligations, and
    will result in a significant increase in net periodic other
    postretirement benefit plan cost during 2009, as described in
    the following section on net periodic benefit cost.

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Net Periodic Benefit Cost

Pension
    Cost

Net periodic pension cost is comprised of the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    projected pension benefit obligation resulting from benefits
    payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service rendered
    during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the projected pension benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    pension fund assets in a particular year.

iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to pension benefit cost for service
    provided in prior years due to amendments in plans or initiation
    of new plans. As the economic benefits of these costs are
    realized in the future periods, these costs are amortized to
    pension expense over the expected service years of the employees.

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on pension plan
    assets or projected pension benefit obligation during a
    particular period. These gains and losses are accumulated and,
    to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected
    pension benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
    assets, they are amortized into pension expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.



The Subsidiaries recognized pension expense of $65 million
    in 2008 as compared to $93 million in 2007 and
    $175 million in 2006. The major components of net periodic
    pension cost described above were as follows:

The decrease in expense from 2006 to 2007 was primarily the
    result of an increase in the expected return on plan assets and
    a decrease in amortization of net actuarial losses resulting
    from the $350 million contribution made in 2006. The
    increase in the interest cost resulted from the increase in the
    discount rate.

The decrease in expense from 2007 to 2008 was primarily the
    result of better than anticipated returns on plan assets in
    2007, coupled with the increase in the discount rate.

For 2009 pension expense, we anticipate an increase of
    approximately $275 million due to poor plan asset
    performance as a result of the economic downturn of the
    financial markets. The expected increase in expense can be
    attributed to lower expected return on assets and increased
    amortization of net actuarial losses.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service cost for
    the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net periodic
    benefit cost over the next year are $198 million and
    $9 million, respectively.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic pension cost was 6.65%, 6.00% and 5.82% for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan
    assets used to calculate the net periodic pension cost for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 8.25%. The
    expected rate of return on plan assets is based on anticipated
    performance of the various asset sectors in which the plan
    invests, weighted by target allocation percentages. Anticipated
    future performance is based on long-term historical returns of
    the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the Subsidiaries’
    long-term expectations on the performance of the markets. While
    the precise expected return derived using this approach will
    fluctuate from year to year, the Subsidiaries’ policy is to
    hold this long-term assumption constant as long as it remains
    within reasonable tolerance from the derived rate.

Based on the December 31, 2008 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $14 million for the pension
    plans.

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Cost

The net periodic other postretirement benefit plan cost consists
    of the following:

i)

Service Cost — Service cost is the increase in the
    expected postretirement plan benefit obligation resulting from
    benefits payable to employees of the Subsidiaries on service
    rendered during the current year.

ii)

Interest Cost on the Liability — Interest cost is the
    time value adjustment on the expected postretirement benefit
    obligation at the end of each year.

iii)

Expected Return on Plan Assets — Expected return on
    plan assets is the assumed return earned by the accumulated
    other postretirement fund assets in a particular year.



iv)

Amortization of Prior Service Cost — This cost relates
    to the increase or decrease to other postretirement benefit plan
    cost for service provided in prior years due to amendments in
    plans or initiation of new plans. As the economic benefits of
    these costs are realized in the future periods these costs are
    amortized to other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

v)

Amortization of Net Actuarial Gains or Losses —
    Actuarial gains and losses result from differences between the
    actual experience and the expected experience on other
    postretirement benefit plan assets or expected postretirement
    plan benefit obligation during a particular year. These gains
    and losses are accumulated and, to the extent they exceed 10% of
    the greater of the accumulated postretirement plan benefit
    obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, they are
    amortized into other postretirement benefit expense over the
    expected service years of the employees.

The Subsidiaries recognized no other postretirement benefit
    expense in 2008 as compared to $8 million in 2007 and
    $58 million in 2006. The major components of net periodic
    other postretirement benefit plan cost described above were as
    follows:

The decrease in benefit cost from 2006 to 2007 primarily
    resulted from a change in the Medicare integration methodology
    for certain retirees. The decrease in benefit cost from 2007 to
    2008 was due to primarily to increases in the discount rate and
    better than expected medical trend experience.

For 2009 postretirement benefit expense, we anticipate an
    increase of approximately $25 million due to poor plan
    asset performance as a result of the economic downturn of the
    financial markets. The expected increase in expense can be
    attributed to lower expected return on assets and increased
    amortization of net actuarial losses.

The estimated net actuarial losses and prior service credit for
    the other postretirement benefit plans that will be amortized
    from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net
    periodic benefit cost over the next year are less than
    $10 million and ($36) million, respectively.

The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the net
    periodic postretirement cost was 6.65%, 6.00% and 5.82% for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets used
    to calculate the net other postretirement benefit plan cost for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 7.33%,
    7.47% and 7.42%, respectively. The expected rate of return on
    plan assets is based on anticipated performance of the various
    asset sectors in which the plan invests, weighted by target
    allocation percentages. Anticipated future performance is based
    on long-term historical returns of the plan assets by sector,
    adjusted for the Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on
    the performance of the markets. While the precise expected
    return derived using this approach will fluctuate from year to
    year, the Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term
    assumption constant as long as it remains within reasonable
    tolerance from the derived rate.

Based on the December 31, 2008 asset balances, a
    25 basis point increase (decrease) in the expected rate of
    return on plan assets would result in a decrease (increase) in
    net periodic benefit cost of $3 million for the other
    postretirement benefit plans.



Funding
    and Cash Flows of Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Obligations

Pension
    Plan Obligations

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of ERISA, as amended. In accordance with such
    practice, no contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 or 2007. No contributions will be
    required for 2009. The Subsidiaries made a discretionary
    contribution of $300 million to the qualified pension plans
    during the year ended December 31, 2008. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, the Subsidiaries did not make any
    discretionary contributions to the qualified pension plans. The
    Subsidiaries expect to make additional discretionary
    contributions of $150 million in 2009.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $43 million and $48 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These benefit
    payments are expected to be at approximately the same level in
    2009.

Gross pension benefit payments for the next ten years, which
    reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to
    be as follows:

Other
    Postretirement Benefit Plan Obligations

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have partially funded such
    plans in advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to
    primarily use their general assets, net of participants’
    contributions, to pay postretirement medical claims as they come
    due in lieu of utilizing plan assets. Total payments equaled
    $149 million and $173 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $120 million, net of participants’ contributions,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2009. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

Gross other postretirement benefit payments for the next ten
    years, which reflect expected future service where appropriate,
    and gross subsidies to be received under the Prescription Drug
    Act are expected to be as follows:

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets. Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments
    are as follows:

Effects
    of Inflation

The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material
    effect on its consolidated results of operations, except insofar
    as inflation may affect interest rates.

Inflation in the United States has remained contained and been
    in a general downtrend for an extended period. However, in light
    of recent and ongoing aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus
    measures by the U.S. federal government and foreign
    governments, it is possible that inflation could increase in the
    future. An increase in inflation could affect our business in
    several ways. During inflationary periods, the value of fixed
    income investments falls which could increase realized and
    unrealized losses. Inflation also increases expenses for labor
    and other materials, potentially putting pressure on
    profitability if such costs can not be passed through in our
    product prices. Inflation could also lead to increased costs for
    losses and loss adjustment expenses in our Auto & Home
    business, which could require us to adjust our pricing to
    reflect our expectations for future inflation. If actual
    inflation exceeds the expectations we use in pricing our
    policies, the profitability of our Auto & Home business
    would be adversely affected. Prolonged and elevated inflation
    could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy
    generally, and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a
    restrictive fiscal and monetary policy, which could constrain
    overall economic activity, inhibit revenue growth and reduce the
    number of attractive investment opportunities.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Fair
    Value

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

.
    SFAS 157 which defines fair value, establishes a consistent
    framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure
    fair value, and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
    measurements and applied the provisions of the statement
    prospectively to assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
    The adoption of SFAS 157 changed the valuation of certain
    freestanding derivatives by moving from a mid to



bid pricing convention as it relates to certain volatility
    inputs as well as the addition of liquidity adjustments and
    adjustments for risks inherent in a particular input or
    valuation technique. The adoption of SFAS 157 also changed
    the valuation of the Company’s embedded derivatives, most
    significantly the valuation of embedded derivatives associated
    with certain riders on variable annuity contracts. The change in
    valuation of embedded derivatives associated with riders on
    annuity contracts resulted from the incorporation of risk
    margins associated with non capital market inputs and the
    inclusion of the Company’s own credit standing in their
    valuation. At January 1, 2008, the impact of adopting
    SFAS 157 on assets and liabilities measured at estimated
    fair value was $30 million ($19 million, net of income
    tax) and was recognized as a change in estimate in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of income where it was
    presented in the respective income statement caption to which
    the item measured at estimated fair value is presented. There
    were no significant changes in estimated fair value of items
    measured at fair value and reflected in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss). The addition of risk margins and
    the Company’s own credit spread in the valuation of
    embedded derivatives associated with annuity contracts may
    result in significant volatility in the Company’s
    consolidated net income in future periods. Note 24 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presents the
    estimated fair value of all assets and liabilities required to
    be measured at estimated fair value as well as the expanded fair
    value disclosures required by SFAS 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    the option to measure most financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value at specified election dates and to
    recognize related unrealized gains and losses in earnings. The
    fair value option is applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis upon adoption of the standard, upon the acquisition of an
    eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment
    or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair
    value election is an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option
    on fixed maturity and equity securities backing certain pension
    products sold in Brazil. Such securities will now be presented
    as trading securities in accordance with SFAS 115 on the
    consolidated balance sheet with subsequent changes in estimated
    fair value recognized in net investment income. Previously,
    these securities were accounted for as available-for-sale
    securities in accordance with SFAS 115 and unrealized gains
    and losses on these securities were recorded as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The
    Company’s insurance joint venture in Japan also elected the
    fair value option for certain of its existing single premium
    deferred annuities and the assets supporting such liabilities.
    The fair value option was elected to achieve improved reporting
    of the asset/liability matching associated with these products.
    Adoption of SFAS 159 by the Company and its Japanese joint
    venture resulted in an increase in retained earnings of
    $27 million, net of income tax, at January 1, 2008.
    The election of the fair value option resulted in the
    reclassification of $10 million, net of income tax, of net
    unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) to retained earnings on January 1, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”)

No. FAS 157-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
    No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address
    Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or
    Measurement under Statement 13

(“FSP 157-1”).

FSP 157-1

amends SFAS 157 to provide a scope out exception for lease
    classification and measurement under SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

. The Company also adopted FSP

No. FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

which
    delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for certain
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair
    value on a nonrecurring basis. The effective date is delayed
    until January 1, 2009 and impacts balance sheet items
    including nonfinancial assets and liabilities in a business
    combination and the impairment testing of goodwill and
    long-lived assets.

Effective September 30, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active

(“FSP 157-3”).

FSP 157-3

provides guidance on how a company’s internal cash flow and
    discount rate assumptions should be considered in the
    measurement of fair value when relevant market data does not
    exist, how observable market information in an inactive market
    affects fair value measurement and how the use of market quotes
    should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable
    and unobservable data available to measure fair value. The
    adoption of

FSP 157-3

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

.



Investments

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8,

Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers
    of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities

(“FSP 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8”).

FSP 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8

requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures
    about a transferors’ continuing involvement in transferred
    financial assets and involvement in VIE. The exact nature of the
    additional required VIE disclosures vary and depend on whether
    or not the VIE is a qualifying special purpose entity
    (“QSPE”). For VIEs that are QSPEs, the additional
    disclosures are only required for a non-transferor sponsor
    holding a variable interest or a non-transferor servicer holding
    a significant variable interest. For VIEs that are not QSPEs,
    the additional disclosures are only required if the Company is
    the primary beneficiary, and if not the primary beneficiary,
    only if the Company holds a significant variable interest or is
    the sponsor. The Company provided all of the material required
    disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP
    No. Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)

99-20-1,

Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue

No. 99-20

(“FSP

EITF 99-20-1”).

FSP

EITF 99-20-1

amends the guidance in EITF Issue

No. 99-20,

Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
    Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to
    Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,

to
    more closely align the guidance to determine whether an
    other-than-temporary impairment has occurred for a beneficial
    interest in a securitized financial asset with the guidance in
    SFAS 115 for debt securities classified as
    available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. The adoption of FSP

EITF 99-20-1

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP
    No. FAS

133-1

and

FIN 45-4,

Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain
    Guarantees — An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and
    Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement
    No. 161

(“FSP 133-1

and

FIN 45-4”).

FSP 133-1

and

FIN 45-4

amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”) to require certain enhanced
    disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives by requiring
    additional information about the potential adverse effects of
    changes in their credit risk, financial performance, and cash
    flows. It also amends FIN No. 45,

Guarantor’s
    Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
    Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and
    Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34

(“FIN 45”), to require an additional
    disclosure about the current status of the payment/performance
    risk of a guarantee. The Company provided all of the material
    required disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue

No. E-23,

Clarification of the Application of the Shortcut Method

(“Issue

E-23”).

Issue

E-23

amended SFAS 133 by permitting interest rate swaps to have
    a non-zero fair value at inception when applying the shortcut
    method of assessing hedge effectiveness, as long as the
    difference between the transaction price (zero) and the fair
    value (exit price), as defined by SFAS 157, is solely
    attributable to a bid-ask spread. In addition, entities are not
    precluded from applying the shortcut method of assessing hedge
    effectiveness in a hedging relationship of interest rate risk
    involving an interest bearing asset or liability in situations
    where the hedged item is not recognized for accounting purposes
    until settlement date as long as the period between trade date
    and settlement date of the hedged item is consistent with
    generally established conventions in the marketplace. The
    adoption of Issue

E-23

did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS 133 and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;



(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a QSPE from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely from the
    embedded call options in the underlying financial assets. The
    adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument through Exercise
    of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue
    B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
    Call Options That Are Exercisable Only by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies that the
    potential settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a creditor
    occurring upon exercise of a put or call option meets the net
    settlement criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39 clarifies that
    an embedded call option, in which the underlying is an interest
    rate or interest rate index, that can accelerate the settlement
    of a debt host financial instrument should not be bifurcated and
    fair valued if the right to accelerate the settlement can be
    exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower) and the investor
    will recover substantially all of its initial net investment.
    The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    tax recognized in a company’s financial statements.
    FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is
    “more likely than not” that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
    measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties,
    along with any related interest and penalties. Previously
    recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this standard
    are required to be charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $35 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits and a $9 million decrease in the
    interest liability for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as a
    $17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits and a $5 million increase in the interest
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are included in
    liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale. The corresponding
    reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
    earnings was $37 million, net of $11 million of
    minority interest included in liabilities of subsidiaries
    held-for-sale. See also Note 15 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Insurance
    Contracts

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted

SOP 05-1

which provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises
    for DAC on internal replacements of insurance and investment
    contracts other than those specifically described in
    SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement and is effective for internal
    replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006.



In addition, in February 2007, the American Institute of
    Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) issued related
    Technical Practice Aids (“TPAs”) to provide further
    clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs became effective concurrently with the adoption of

SOP 05-1.

As a result of the adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs, if an internal replacement modification
    substantially changes a contract, then the DAC is written off
    immediately through income and any new deferrable costs
    associated with the new replacement are deferred. If a contract
    modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC
    amortization on the original contract will continue and any
    acquisition costs associated with the related modification are
    immediately expensed.

The adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs resulted in a reduction to DAC and VOBA on
    January 1, 2007 and an acceleration of the amortization
    period relating primarily to the Company’s group life and
    health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset
    provisions. Prior to the adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts was amortized over the expected renewable
    life of the contract. Upon adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts is to be amortized over the rate reset
    period. The impact as of January 1, 2007 was a cumulative
    effect adjustment of $292 million, net of income tax of
    $161 million, which was recorded as a reduction to retained
    earnings.

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the estimated fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there was no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date. See also
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical
    Accounting Estimates” and Note 17 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the SEC in Staff Accounting
    Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,

Share-Based
    Payment

— using the modified prospective
    transition method. In accordance with the modified prospective
    transition method, results for prior periods have not been
    restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of all
    stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS 123 on a
    prospective basis effective January 1, 2003. The Company
    did not modify the substantive terms of any existing awards
    prior to adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions



of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).

The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested prior to
    the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations as of the date of
    adoption.

Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility. The pro forma
    impact of this change in expense recognition policy for
    stock-based compensation is detailed in Note 18 of the
    Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Other
    Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

(“FSP 39-1”).

FSP 39-1

amends FIN 39,

Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
    Contracts

(“FIN 39”), to permit a reporting
    entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to
    reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to
    return cash collateral (a payable) against fair value amounts
    recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
    counterparty under the same master netting arrangement that have
    been offset in accordance with FIN 39.

FSP 39-1

also amends FIN 39 for certain terminology modifications.
    Upon adoption of

FSP 39-1,

the Company did not change its accounting policy of not
    offsetting fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments under master netting arrangements. The adoption of

FSP 39-1

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 109,

Written Loan Commitments Recorded at
    Fair Value through Earnings

(“SAB 109”),
    which amends SAB No. 105,

Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments

. SAB 109 provides
    guidance on (i) incorporating expected net future cash
    flows when related to the associated servicing of a loan when
    measuring fair value; and (ii) broadening the SEC
    staff’s view that internally-developed intangible assets
    should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative
    loan commitment or to written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings.
    Internally-developed intangible assets are not considered a
    component of the related instruments. The adoption of
    SAB 109 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 07-6,

Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate When the Agreement
    Includes a Buy-Sell Clause

(“EITF 07-6”)

prospectively.

EITF 07-6

addresses whether the existence of a buy-sell arrangement would
    preclude partial sales treatment when real estate is sold to a
    jointly owned entity.

EITF 07-6

concludes that the existence of a buy-sell clause does not
    necessarily preclude partial sale treatment under current
    guidance. The adoption of EITF

07-6

did not
    have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. EITF 00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP

EITF 00-19-2”).

FSP

EITF 00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately



recognized and measured in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies.

The adoption of FSP

EITF 00-19-2

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP 13-2”).

FSP 13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition,

FSP 13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The adoption of

FSP 13-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other
    requirements, SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a
    servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes
    an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a
    servicing contract in certain situations. The adoption of
    SFAS 156 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively EITF Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF 05-7”).

EITF 05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized upon the
    modification as a discount (or premium) associated with the
    debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of

EITF 05-7

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF 05-8”).

EITF 05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a temporary difference; and
    (ii) the establishment of the deferred tax liability for
    the basis difference should result in an adjustment to
    additional paid-in capital.

EITF 05-8

was applied retrospectively for all instruments with a
    beneficial conversion feature accounted for in accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 98-5,

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios

, and EITF Issue

No. 00-27,

Application of Issue

No. 98-5

to Certain Convertible Instruments. T

he adoption of

EITF 05-8

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(“SFAS 154”).
    SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
    periods’ financial statements for a voluntary change in
    accounting principle unless it is deemed



impracticable. It also requires that a change in the method of
    depreciation, amortization, or depletion for long-lived,
    non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting
    estimate rather than a change in accounting principle. The
    adoption of SFAS 154 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations — A
    Replacement of FASB Statement No. 141

(“SFAS 141(r)”) and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). Under SFAS 141(r) and
    SFAS 160:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Certain acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair
    value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at
    either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under
    existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies.

•

Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income
    tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect
    income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.

The pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008 and apply prospectively to
    business combinations after that date. Presentation and
    disclosure requirements related to noncontrolling interests must
    be retrospectively applied. The Company will apply the guidance
    in SFAS 141(r) prospectively on its accounting for future
    acquisitions and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160
    to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-6,

Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations

(“EITF 08-6”).

EITF 08-6

addresses a number of issues associated with the impact that
    SFAS 141(r) and SFAS 160 might have on the accounting
    for equity method investments, including how an equity method
    investment should initially be measured, how it should be tested
    for impairment, and how changes in classification from equity
    method to cost method should be treated.

EITF 08-6

is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning on or
    after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of

EITF 08-6

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-7,

Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets

(“EITF 08-7”).

EITF 08-7

requires that an acquired defensive intangible asset (i.e., an
    asset an entity does not intend to actively use, but rather,
    intends to prevent others from using) be accounted for as a
    separate unit of accounting at time of acquisition, not combined
    with the acquirer’s existing intangible assets. In
    addition, the EITF concludes that a defensive intangible asset
    may not be considered immediately abandoned following its



acquisition or have indefinite life. The Company will apply the
    guidance of

EITF 08-7

prospectively to its intangible assets acquired after fiscal
    years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”). This change is intended to
    improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS 141(r) and other GAAP.

FSP 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The requirement for determining
    useful lives and related disclosures will be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired as of, and
    subsequent to, the effective date.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

—

An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161
    requires enhanced qualitative disclosures about objectives and
    strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about
    fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative
    instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related
    contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    Company will provide all of the material required disclosures in
    the appropriate future interim and annual periods.

Other
    Pronouncements

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 132(r)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

(“FSP 132(r)-1”). FSP 132(r)-1
    amends SFAS No. 132(r),

Employers’ Disclosures
    about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

to enhance
    the transparency surrounding the types of assets and associated
    risks in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan. The FSP requires an employer to disclose
    information about the valuation of plan assets similar to that
    required under SFAS 157. FSP 132(r)-1 is effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company
    will provide all of the material required disclosures in the
    appropriate future annual period.

In September 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair
    Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement

(“EITF 08-5”).

EITF 08-5

concludes that an issuer of a liability with a third-party
    credit enhancement should not include the effect of the credit
    enhancement in the fair value measurement of the liability. In
    addition,

EITF 08-5

requires disclosures about the existence of any third-party
    credit enhancement related to liabilities that are measured at
    fair value.

EITF 08-5

is effective beginning in the first reporting period after
    December 15, 2008 and will be applied prospectively, with
    the effect of initial application included in the change in fair
    value of the liability in the period of adoption. The Company
    does not expect the adoption of

EITF 08-5

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In June 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) Is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

(“EITF 07-5”).

EITF 07-5

provides a framework for evaluating the terms of a particular
    instrument and whether such terms qualify the instrument as
    being indexed to an entity’s own stock.

EITF 07-5

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied by
    recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance
    of retained earnings at the date of adoption. The Company does
    not expect the adoption of

EITF 07-5

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 140-3,

Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets and Repurchase
    Financing Transactions

(“FSP 140-3”).

FSP 140-3

provides guidance for evaluating whether to account for a
    transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing as a
    single transaction or as two separate transactions.

FSP 140-3

is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company
    does not expect the adoption of

FSP 140-3

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.



Investments

Investment Risks.

The Company’s primary
    investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax,
    risk-adjusted investment income and risk-adjusted total return
    while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The Company is exposed to four primary
    sources of investment risk:

•

credit risk, relating to the uncertainty associated with the
    continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of
    principal and interest;

•

interest rate risk, relating to the market price and cash flow
    variability associated with changes in market interest rates;

•

liquidity risk, relating to the diminished ability to sell
    certain investments in times of strained market
    conditions; and

•

market valuation risk.

The Company manages risk through in-house fundamental analysis
    of the underlying obligors, issuers, transaction structures and
    real estate properties. The Company also manages credit risk,
    market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and
    issuer diversification and asset allocation. For real estate and
    agricultural assets, the Company manages credit risk and market
    valuation risk through geographic, property type and product
    type diversification and asset allocation. The Company manages
    interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management
    strategies; product design, such as the use of market value
    adjustment features and surrender charges; and proactive
    monitoring and management of certain non-guaranteed elements of
    its products, such as the resetting of credited interest and
    dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments. The
    Company also uses certain derivative instruments in the
    management of credit and interest rate risks.

Current Environment.

Concerns over the
    availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market,
    geopolitical issues, energy costs, inflation and a declining
    real estate market in the United States have contributed to
    increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy
    and the financial markets going forward. These factors, combined
    with declining business and consumer confidence and increased
    unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and with
    the National Bureau of Economic Research having announced in the
    4th quarter of 2008 an ongoing U.S. recession that
    began in December 2007. As a result of the stress experienced by
    the global financial markets, the fixed-income markets are
    experiencing a period of extreme volatility which has negatively
    impacted market liquidity conditions. Initially, the concerns on
    the part of market participants were focused on the sub-prime
    segment of the mortgage-backed securities market. However, these
    concerns have since expanded to include a broad range of
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed and other fixed income
    securities, including those rated investment grade, the
    U.S. and international credit and inter-bank money markets
    generally, and a wide range of financial institutions and
    markets, asset classes and sectors. Securities that are less
    liquid are more difficult to value and have fewer opportunities
    for disposal.

As a result of this unprecedented disruption and market
    dislocation, we have experienced both volatility in the
    valuation of certain investments and decreased liquidity in
    certain asset classes and, as such, have experienced an increase
    in certain Level 3 investments. As demonstrated in “-
    Fixed Maturity Securities — Available for
    Sale — Fair Value Hierarchy,” during 2008 we have
    experienced an increase in certain Level 3 investments
    which include less liquid fixed maturity securities and equity
    securities with very limited trading activity. Even some of our
    very high quality assets have been more illiquid for periods of
    time as a result of the recent challenging market conditions.
    These market conditions have also lead to an increase in
    unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities in
    2008, particularly for residential and commercial
    mortgage-backed, asset-backed and corporate fixed maturity

Year
    Ended December 31, 2008 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2007

Net investment income decreased by $2,024 million, or 11%,
    to $16,304 million for the year ended December 31,
    2008 from $18,328 million for the comparable 2007 period.
    Excluding the impacts of discontinued operations and periodic
    settlement payments on derivatives instruments as described in
    notes 4 and 5 of the yield table presented above, net
    investment income decreased by $1,767 million, or 10%, to
    $16,296 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    from $18,063 million for the comparable 2007 period.
    Management attributes $3,141 million of this change to a
    decrease in yields, partially offset by an increase of
    $1,374 million due to growth in average invested assets.
    Average invested assets are calculated on the cost basis without
    unrealized gains and losses. The decrease in net investment
    income attributable to lower yields was primarily due to lower
    returns on other limited partnership interests, real estate
    joint ventures, short-term investments, fixed maturity
    securities, and mortgage loans partially offset by improved
    securities lending results. The reduction in yields associated
    with other limited partnership interests were primarily due to
    the lack of liquidity and credit in the financial markets as
    well as unprecedented investor redemptions in an environment
    with steep declines in the public equity and debt markets. The
    decrease in real estate joint ventures yields was primarily due
    to a slow down in lease and related sales activities in a period
    with declining property values as well as fund investment
    write-downs. The decrease in short-term investment yields was
    primarily attributable to declines in short-term interest rates.
    The decrease in the fixed maturity securities’ yield was
    primarily due to lower yields on floating rate securities due to
    declines in short-term interest rates and an increased
    allocation to lower yielding



U.S. Treasuries, partially offset by improved securities
    lending results. The decrease in yields associated with our
    mortgage loan portfolio was primarily attributable to lower
    prepayments on commercial mortgage loans and lower yields on
    variable rate loans due to declines in short-term interest
    rates. The decrease in net investment income attributable to
    lower yields was partially offset by increased net investment
    income attributable to an increase in average invested assets on
    an amortized cost basis, primarily within short-term
    investments, other invested assets including derivatives,
    mortgage loans, other limited partnership interests, and real
    estate joint ventures.

Investment
    Outlook

Management anticipates that the significant volatility in the
    equity, credit and real estate markets will continue in 2009
    which could continue to impact net investment income and the
    related yields on private equity funds, hedge funds and real
    estate joint ventures, included within our other limited
    partnerships and real estate and real estate joint venture
    portfolios

.

Further, in light of the current market
    conditions, liquidity will be reinvested in a prudent manner and
    invested according to our ALM discipline in appropriate assets
    over time. However, considering the continued, uncertain credit
    market conditions, management plans to continue to maintain a
    slightly higher than normal level of short-term liquidity. Net
    investment income may be adversely affected if the reinvestment
    process occurs over an extended period of time due to
    challenging market conditions or asset availability.

Year
    Ended December 31, 2007 compared with the Year Ended
    December 31, 2006

Net investment income increased by $1,699 million, or 10%,
    to $18,328 million for the year ended December 31,
    2007 from $16,629 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    Excluding the impacts of discontinued operations and periodic
    settlement payments on derivatives instruments as described in
    notes 4 and 5 to the yield table presented above, net
    investment income increased by $1,816 million, or 11%, to
    $18,063 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    from $16,247 million for the comparable 2006 period.
    Management attributes $1,078 million of this increase to
    growth in the average asset base and $738 million to an
    increase in yields. Average invested assets are calculated on
    the cost basis without unrealized gains and losses. The increase
    in net investment income attributable to higher yields was
    primarily due to higher returns on fixed maturity securities,
    other limited partnership interests excluding hedge funds,
    equity securities and improved securities lending results,
    partially offset by lower returns on real estate and real estate
    joint ventures, cash and short-term investments, hedge funds and
    mortgage loans. The improvement in yields associated with fixed
    maturity securities was due primarily to higher bond prepayment
    fees related to decreasing interest rates in the second half of
    2007 and to a repositioning of the portfolio in 2006 during a
    rising interest rate environment. The improvement in yields
    associated with other limited partnership interests, excluding
    hedge funds, was due primarily to a robust private equity market
    resulting in improved returns on equity based funds and
    increased distributions on cost basis funds. The increase in
    equity securities yields is primarily related to increased
    earnings on the non-redeemable preferred securities comprised of
    perpetual hybrid securities and higher dividend income on our
    common stock holdings. The decrease in real estate and real
    estate joint ventures yields was primarily due lower income from
    the sale of the Peter Cooper and Stuyvesant Town properties in
    fourth quarter 2006 and reinvestment in real estate joint
    ventures and development funds with more variable income
    streams. The decrease in yields for cash and short-term
    investment was primarily attributable to declines in short-term
    interest rates in the second half of 2007. The decrease in hedge
    fund yields was primarily due to increasing volatility in
    private equity markets in the latter half of 2007, driven by
    economic uncertainty as reflected in credit and equity markets.
    The decrease in yields associated with our mortgage loan
    portfolio was primarily attributable to lower prepayments on
    commercial mortgage loans as well as new loan production at
    lower yields due to the declines in interest rates in the second
    half of 2007.

Fixed
    Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale

Fixed maturity securities consisted principally of
    publicly-traded and privately placed fixed maturity securities,
    and represented 58% and 71% of total cash and invested assets at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on
    estimated fair value, public fixed maturity securities
    represented $156.7 billion, or 83%, and
    $196.7 billion, or 85%, of total fixed maturity securities
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Based on
    estimated fair value, private fixed maturity securities
    represented $31.6 billion, or 17%, and $35.6 billion,
    or 15%, of total fixed maturity securities at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.



Valuation of Securities.

Management is
    responsible for the determination of estimated fair value. The
    estimated fair value of publicly-traded fixed maturity, equity
    and trading securities as well as short-term investments is
    determined by management after considering one of three primary
    sources of information: quoted market prices in active markets,
    independent pricing services, or independent broker quotations.
    The number of quotes obtained varies by instrument and depends
    on the liquidity of the particular instrument

.

Generally
    we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all
    asset classes and do obtain multiple prices for certain
    securities, but ultimately utilize the price with the highest
    placement in the fair value hierarchy. Independent pricing
    services that value these instruments use market standard
    valuation methodologies based on inputs that are market
    observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market. The market standard
    valuation methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or similar techniques. The
    assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard
    valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to,
    interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or counterparty,
    industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions,
    sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated duration, and
    management’s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated
    future cash flows. When a price is not available in the active
    market or through an independent pricing service, management
    will value the security primarily using independent non-binding
    broker quotations. Independent non-binding broker quotations
    utilize inputs that are not market observable or cannot be
    derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data.

Senior management, independent of the trading and investing
    functions, is responsible for the oversight of control systems
    and valuation policies, including reviewing and approving new
    transaction types and markets, for ensuring that observable
    market prices and market-based parameters are used for valuation
    wherever possible and for determining that judgmental valuation
    adjustments, if any, are based upon established policies and are
    applied consistently over time. Management reviews its valuation
    methodologies on an ongoing basis and ensures that any changes
    to valuation methodologies are justified. The Company gains
    assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent
    application of input assumptions, valuation methodologies, and
    compliance with accounting standards for fair value
    determination through various controls designed to ensure that
    the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately
    valued and represent an exit price. The control systems and
    procedures include, but are not limited to, analysis of
    portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns, comparing
    a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value
    estimates, comparing fair value estimates to management’s
    knowledge of the current market, reviewing the bid/ask spreads
    to assess activity and ongoing confirmation that independent
    pricing services use, wherever possible, market-based parameters
    for valuation. Management determines the observability of inputs
    used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing
    sources or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be
    corroborated by observable market data. The Company also follows
    a formal process to challenge any prices received from
    independent pricing services that are not considered
    representative of fair value. If we conclude that prices
    received from independent pricing services are not reflective of
    market activity or representative of estimated fair value, we
    will seek independent non-binding broker quotes or use an
    internally developed valuation to override these prices. Such
    overrides are classified as Level 3. Despite the credit
    events prevalent in the current dislocated markets and reduced
    levels of liquidity at the end of 2008, our internally developed
    valuations of current estimated fair value, which reflect our
    estimates of liquidity and non performance risks, compared with
    pricing received from the independent pricing services, did not
    produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed
    maturity securities portfolio. Our estimates of liquidity and
    non performance risks are generally based on available market
    evidence and on what other market participants would use. In
    absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is
    used. As a result, we generally continued to use the price
    provided by the independent pricing service under our normal
    pricing protocol and pricing overrides were not material. As
    discussed in the “— Fair Value Hierarchy” below,
    during 2008 due to these conditions, we have experienced an
    increase in Level 3 securities holdings which include less
    liquid fixed maturity and equity securities, some with very
    limited trading activity. Even some of our very high quality
    invested assets have been more illiquid for periods of time as a
    result of the challenging market conditions. The Company uses
    the results of this analysis for classifying the estimated fair
    value of these instruments in Level 1, 2 or 3. For example,
    management will review the estimated fair values received to
    determine whether corroborating evidence (i.e., similar
    observable positions and actual



trades) will support a Level 2 classification in the
    estimated fair value hierarchy. Security prices which cannot be
    corroborated due to relatively less pricing transparency and
    diminished liquidity will be classified as Level 3.

For privately placed fixed maturity securities, the Company
    determines the estimated fair value generally through matrix
    pricing or discounted cash flow techniques. The discounted cash
    flow valuations rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the
    security, credit spreads of comparable public securities, and
    secondary transactions, as well as taking account of, among
    other factors, the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced
    liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities.

The Company has reviewed the significance and observability of
    inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the
    appropriate SFAS 157 fair value hierarchy level for each of
    its securities. Based on the results of this review and
    investment class analyses, each instrument is categorized as
    Level 1, 2, or 3 based on the priority of the inputs to the
    respective valuation methodologies. While prices for certain
    U.S. Treasury and agency fixed maturity securities, certain
    foreign government fixed maturity securities, exchange-traded
    common stock, and certain short-term money market securities
    have been classified into Level 1 because of high volumes
    of trading activity and narrow bid/ask spreads, most securities
    valued by independent pricing services have been classified into
    Level 2 because the significant inputs used in pricing
    these securities are market observable or can be corroborated
    using market observable information. Most investment grade
    privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified
    within Level 2, while most below investment grade or
    distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been
    classified within Level 3. Where estimated fair values are
    determined by independent pricing sources or by independent
    non-binding broker quotations that utilize inputs that are not
    market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data, these instruments have
    been classified as Level 3. Use of independent non-binding
    broker quotations generally indicates there is a lack of
    liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the process to
    develop these price estimates causing them to be considered
    Level 3.

Ratings.

The Securities Valuation Office of
    the NAIC evaluates the fixed maturity investments of insurers
    for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one
    of six investment categories called “NAIC
    designations.” The NAIC ratings are similar to the rating
    agency designations of the Nationally Recognized Statistical
    Rating Organizations (“NRSROs”) for marketable bonds.
    NAIC ratings 1 and 2 include bonds generally considered
    investment grade (rated “Baa3” or higher by
    Moody’s or rated “BBB — ” or higher by
    S&P and Fitch), by such rating organizations. NAIC ratings
    3 through 6 include bonds generally considered below investment
    grade (rated “Ba1” or lower by Moody’s, or rated
    “BB+” or lower by S&P and Fitch).

The following table presents the Company’s total fixed
    maturity securities by NRSRO designation and the equivalent
    ratings of the NAIC, as well as the percentage, based on

Amounts presented are based on rating agency designations.
    Comparisons between NAIC ratings and rating agency designations
    are published by the NAIC. The rating agency designations are
    based on availability and the midpoint of the applicable ratings
    among Moody’s, S&P and Fitch. If no rating is
    available from a rating agency, then the MetLife rating is used.



Below Investment Grade or Non-Rated Fixed Maturity
    Securities.

The Company held fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair values that were below investment
    grade or not rated by an independent rating agency that totaled
    $12.4 billion and $17.4 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. These securities had net unrealized
    losses of $5,094 million and $103 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Non-Income Producing Fixed Maturity
    Securities.

Non-income producing fixed maturity
    securities at estimated fair value were $75 million and
    $12 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Net unrealized gains (losses) associated with
    non-income producing fixed maturity securities were
    ($19) million and $11 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Enhanced by Financial
    Guarantee Insurers.

At December 31, 2008,
    $4.9 billion of the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s fixed maturity securities were credit enhanced by
    financial guarantee insurers of which $2.0 billion,
    $2.0 billion and $0.9 billion, are included within
    state and political subdivision securities, U.S. corporate
    securities, and asset-backed securities, respectively, and 15%
    and 68% were guaranteed by financial guarantee insurers who were
    Aa and Baa rated, respectively. As described below, all of the
    asset-backed securities that are credit enhanced by financial
    guarantee insurers are asset-backed securities which are backed
    by sub-prime mortgage loans.

Composition and pricing source for significant Level 3
    fixed maturity and equity securities are as follows:

As shown above, the majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity
    and equity securities (91%) are concentrated in four of the
    sectors shown above, U.S. and foreign corporate securities,
    asset-backed securities and non-redeemable preferred securities.
    The pricing sources for these sectors are as follows at
    December 31, 2008:

Level 3 fixed maturity securities are priced principally
    through independent broker quotations or market standard
    valuation methodologies using inputs that are not market
    observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated
    by observable market data. Level 3 fixed maturity
    securities consists of less liquid fixed maturity securities
    with very limited trading activity or where less price
    transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation
    methodologies including below investment grade private
    placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities
    (included in U.S. and foreign corporate securities) and
    less liquid asset-backed securities including securities
    supported by sub-prime mortgage loans (included in asset-backed
    securities). Level 3 non-redeemable preferred securities
    include securities with very limited trading activity or where
    less price transparency exists around the inputs to the
    valuation.

The change in Level 3 fixed maturity securities during the
    period was as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2008, Level 3 fixed
    maturity securities decreased by $5,910 million or 25%, due
    primarily to increased unrealized losses recognized in other
    comprehensive income (loss) and to a lesser extent sales and
    settlements in excess of purchases. The increased unrealized
    losses in fixed maturity securities were concentrated in
    asset-backed securities (including residential mortgage-backed
    securities backed by sub-prime mortgage loans), U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities and to a lesser extent commercial
    mortgage-backed securities due to current market conditions
    including less liquidity and increased spreads for such
    securities. Net sales and settlements in excess of purchases of
    fixed maturity securities were concentrated in asset-backed
    securities (including residential mortgage-backed securities
    backed by sub-prime mortgage loans) and U.S. and foreign
    corporate securities.



A rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities measured at estimated fair
    value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable
    (Level 3) inputs for the year ended December 31,

Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 —

a) Total gains and losses (in earnings and other
    comprehensive income (loss)) are calculated assuming transfers
    in (out) of Level 3 occurred at the beginning of the
    period. Items transferred in and out in the same period are
    excluded from the rollforward.

b) Net transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 for fixed maturity securities were
    $1,839 million for the year ended December 31, 2008
    and were comprised of transfers in of $3,522 million and
    transfers out of ($1,683) million. Net transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 for equity securities were ($29) million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 and were comprised of
    transfers in of $38 million and transfers out of
    ($67) million.

c) Included in earnings and other comprehensive income
    (loss) in the above table, that were incurred for transfers in
    subsequent to their transfer to Level 3 were
    ($479) million and ($723) million, respectively, for
    fixed maturity securities, and ($20) million and
    ($3) million, respectively, for equity securities, for the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

d) Overall, transfers in

and/or

out
    of Level 3 are attributable to a change in the
    observability of inputs. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, fixed maturity securities transfers into Level 3 of
    $3,522 million resulted primarily from current market
    conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity,
    decreased liquidity, fixed maturity securities going into
    default, and ratings downgrades (e.g. from investment grade to
    below investment grade). These current market conditions have
    resulted in decreased transparency of valuations, and an
    increased use of broker quotations and unobservable inputs to
    determine fair value. During the year ended December 31,
    2008, fixed maturity securities transfers out of Level 3 of
    ($1,683) million resulted primarily from increased
    transparency of both new issuances that subsequent to issuance
    and establishment of trading activity became priced by pricing
    services and existing issuances that, over time, the Company was
    able to corroborate pricing received from independent pricing
    services with observable inputs.

    Estimates — Investments” for further information
    on the estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
    reported above.

The Company performs a regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are other-than-temporarily impaired. One of the criteria which
    the Company considers in its other-than-temporary impairment
    analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their
    value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized
    cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold securities
    considers broad portfolio management objectives such as
    asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry segment
    exposures, interest rate views and the overall total return
    focus. In following these portfolio management objectives,
    changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past
    reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that
    were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions to sell are
    based on current conditions or the Company’s need to shift
    the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives
    including liquidity needs or



duration targets on asset/liability managed portfolios. The
    Company attempts to anticipate these types of changes and if a
    sale decision has been made on an impaired security and that
    security is not expected to recover prior to the expected time
    of sale, the security will be deemed other-than-temporarily
    impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an
    other-than-temporary impairment loss will be recognized. See
    “— Summary of Critical Accounting
    Estimates — Investments.”

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $8.0 billion and
    $3.9 billion, respectively, of unrealized losses related to
    fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss position of
    less than 20% of cost or amortized cost, which represented 9%
    and 4%, respectively, of the cost or amortized cost of such
    securities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $75 million
    and $316 million, respectively, of unrealized losses
    related to equity securities with an unrealized loss position of
    less than 20% of cost, which represented 13% and 10%,
    respectively, of the cost of such securities.

At December 31, 2008, $20.8 billion and
    $903 million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities, respectively, with an
    unrealized loss position of 20% or more of cost or amortized
    cost, which represented 38% and 43% of the cost or amortized
    cost of such fixed maturity securities and equity securities,
    respectively. Of such unrealized losses of $20.8 billion
    and $903 million, $17.2 billion and $519 million
    related to fixed maturity securities and equity securities,
    respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position for a
    period of less than six months. At December 31, 2007,
    $402 million and $133 million of unrealized losses
    related to fixed maturity securities and equity securities,
    respectively, with an unrealized loss position of 20% or more of
    cost or amortized cost, which represented 28% and 31% of the
    cost or amortized cost of such fixed maturity securities and
    equity securities, respectively. Of such unrealized losses of
    $402 million and $133 million, $383 million and
    $133 million related to fixed maturity securities and
    equity securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss
    position for a period of less than six months.

The Company held 699 fixed maturity securities and 33 equity
    securities, each with a gross unrealized loss at
    December 31, 2008 of greater than $10 million. These
    699 fixed maturity securities represented 50%, or
    $14.5 billion in the aggregate, of the gross unrealized
    loss on fixed maturity securities. These 33 equity securities
    represented 71%, or $699 million in the aggregate, of the
    gross unrealized loss on equity securities. The Company held 23
    fixed maturity securities and six equity securities, each with a
    gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2007 of greater than
    $10 million. These 23 fixed maturity securities represented
    8%, or $357 million in the aggregate, of the gross
    unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities. These six equity
    securities represented 20%, or $90 million in the
    aggregate, of the gross unrealized loss on equity securities.
    The fixed maturity and equity securities, each with a gross
    unrealized loss greater than $10 million, increased
    $14.7 billion during the year ended December 31, 2008.
    These securities were included in the regular evaluation of
    whether such securities are other-than-temporarily impaired.
    Based upon the Company’s current evaluation of these
    securities in accordance with its impairment policy, the cause
    of the decline being primarily attributable to a rise in market
    yields caused principally by an extensive widening of credit
    spreads which resulted from a lack of market liquidity and a
    short-term market dislocation versus a long-term deterioration
    in credit quality, and the Company’s current intent and
    ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity securities with
    unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient for them to
    recover, the Company has concluded that these securities are not
    other-than-temporarily impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    of, and severity of, an unrealized loss position, such as
    unrealized losses of 20% or more for equity securities, which
    was $903 million and $133 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, is given greater weight and
    consideration, than for fixed maturity securities. An extended
    and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security
    may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service
    all scheduled interest and principal payments and the
    Company’s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual
    cash flows, as well as the Company’s ability and intent to
    hold the security, including holding the security until the
    earlier of a recovery in value, or until maturity. In contrast,
    for an equity security, greater weight and consideration is
    given by the Company to a decline in market value and the
    likelihood such market value decline will recover.

Equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20% or more for six
    months or greater was $384 million at December 31,
    2008, of which, $382 million of the unrealized losses, or
    99%, are for non-redeemable preferred securities, of which
    $377 million of the unrealized losses, or 99%, are for
    investment grade non-redeemable preferred securities. Of the
    $377 million of unrealized losses for investment grade
    non-redeemable preferred



securities, $372 million of the unrealized losses, or 99%,
    was comprised of unrealized losses on investment grade financial
    services industry non-redeemable preferred securities, of which
    85% are rated A or higher.

Equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20% or more for
    less than six months was $519 million at December 31,
    2008 of which $427 million of the unrealized losses, or
    82%, are for non-redeemable preferred securities, of which
    $421 million of the unrealized losses, or 98% are for
    investment grade non-redeemable preferred securities. Of the
    $421 million of unrealized losses for investment grade
    non-redeemable preferred securities, $417 million of the
    unrealized losses, or 99%, was comprised of unrealized losses on
    investment grade financial services industry non-redeemable
    preferred securities, of which 81% are rated A or higher.

There were no equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20%
    or more for twelve months or greater.

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process during 2008, the Company evaluated its holdings in
    non-redeemable preferred securities, particularly those of
    financial services industry companies. The Company considered
    several factors including whether there has been any
    deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of
    recovery in value of non-redeemable preferred securities with a
    severe or an extended unrealized loss. With respect to common
    stock holdings, the Company considered the duration and severity
    of the securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more;
    and the duration of the securities in an unrealized loss
    position of 20% or less with an extended unrealized loss
    position (i.e. 12 months or more).

At December 31, 2008, there are $903 million of equity
    securities with an unrealized losses of 20% or more, of which
    $809 million of the unrealized losses, or 90%, were for
    non-redeemable preferred securities. Through December 31,
    2008, $798 million of the unrealized losses of 20% or more,
    or 99%, of the non-redeemable preferred securities were
    investment grade securities, of which, $789 million of the
    unrealized losses of 20% or more, or 99%, are investment grade
    financial services industry non-redeemable preferred securities;
    and all non-redeemable preferred securities with unrealized
    losses of 20% or more, regardless of rating, have not deferred
    any dividend payments.

Also, the Company believes the unrealized loss position is not
    necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of these
    securities, and with respect to fixed maturity securities, it
    has the ability and intent to hold until the earlier of the
    recovery in value, or until maturity, and with respect to equity
    securities, it has the ability and intent to hold until the
    recovery in value.

Future other-than-temporary impairments will depend primarily on
    economic fundamentals, issuer performance, changes in collateral
    valuation, changes in interest rates, and changes in credit
    spreads. If economic fundamentals and other of the above factors
    continue to deteriorate, additional other-than-temporary
    impairments may be incurred in upcoming quarters. See also

Other than credit-related writedowns include items such as
    equity securities where the primary reason for the writedown was
    the severity and/or the duration of an unrealized loss position
    and fixed maturity securities where an interest-rate related
    writedown was taken.



Overview of Fixed Maturity and Equity Security Writedowns.

Writedowns of fixed maturity and equity securities were
    $1.7 billion, $97 million and $80 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Writedowns of fixed maturity securities were $1.3 billion,
    $78 million and $56 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Writedowns
    of equity securities were $430 million, $19 million
    and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company’s credit-related writedowns of fixed maturity
    and equity securities were $1.2 billion, $77 million
    and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company’s credit-related
    writedowns of fixed maturity securities were $1.1 billion,
    $58 million and $56 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    Company’s credit-related writedowns of equity securities
    were $90 million, $19 million and $24 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The $90 million of credit-related equity
    securities writedowns in 2008 were primarily on non-redeemable
    preferred securities.

The Company’s three largest impairments totaled
    $528 million, $19 million and $33 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts
    the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities
    accordingly. The Company does not change the revised cost basis
    for subsequent recoveries in value.

The Company sold or disposed of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss that had an estimated fair value of
    $29.9 billion, $47.1 billion and $69.2 billion
    during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Gross losses excluding impairments for fixed
    maturity and equity securities were $1.8 billion,
    $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

2008 — Financial Institutions, Individually
    Significant and Trust Preferred Security Impairments.

Of the fixed maturity and equity securities impairments of
    $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    $1,014 million were concentrated in the Company’s
    financial services industry securities holdings and were
    comprised of $673 million in impairments on fixed maturity
    securities and $341 million in impairments on equity
    securities. The circumstances that gave rise to these
    impairments were financial restructurings, bankruptcy filings or
    difficult underlying operating environments for the entities
    concerned. A significant portion of the impairments were
    concentrated in three particular financial institutions that
    entered bankruptcy, were subject to Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (“FDIC”) receivership or received federal
    government capital infusions as described further below:

•

Lehman —

In connection with the filing on
    September 15, 2008 by Lehman of a Chapter 11
    bankruptcy petition, the Company recorded in 2008, impairments
    totaling $372 million (i.e., $329 million fixed
    maturity securities and $43 million equity securities) as
    follows related to Lehman — $256 million of
    Lehman senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt,
    $73 million of debt instruments issued by a special-purpose
    entity backed by Lehman obligations, and $43 million of
    Lehman non-redeemable preferred securities. The Company has also
    made secured loans to affiliates of Lehman which are fully
    collateralized; accordingly, no impairment charge has been
    recorded.

•

Washington Mutual —

In connection with the
    September 25, 2008 acquisition of Washington Mutual’s
    banking operation by JP Morgan Chase & Co. relating to
    the FDIC receivership of its bank subsidiaries, which
    transaction excluded the assumption of any senior unsecured
    debt, subordinated debt, and preferred securities of Washington
    Mutual and its bank subsidiaries, the Company recorded
    impairments in 2008, totaling $197 million (i.e.,
    $125 million fixed maturity securities and $72 million
    equity securities) as follows — $125 million of
    Washington Mutual subordinated debt, $71 million of
    Washington Mutual non-redeemable preferred securities, and less
    than $1 million of Washington Mutual common stock holdings.
    These impairments were partially offset by a $17 million
    realized gain on credit default swaps purchased on Washington
    Mutual debt.

•

AIG —

In connection with the September 23,
    2008 definitive agreement between AIG and the Federal Reserve
    Bank of New York for a two-year revolving credit facility and
    issuance of preferred stock that



granted 79.9% common stock voting power to the United States
    Treasury, the Company recorded impairments on securities for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 totaling $37 million
    (i.e., $35 million fixed maturity securities and
    $2 million equity securities) as follows —
    $35 million of AIG unsecured subordinated debt holdings,
    and $2 million of AIG common stock. Additionally, a
    $2 million impairment was recorded on an AIG
    affiliate-managed other limited partnership investment for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, for a total AIG impairment of
    $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Overall, impairments related to these three counterparties
    accounted for impairments on fixed maturity and equity
    securities of $489 million and $117 million,
    respectively, for a total of $606 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. These three counterparties account
    for substantial portion, $489 million, of the financial
    institution related fixed maturity security impairments of
    $673 million; however, at $117 million, they do not
    account for the majority of the financial institution related
    equity security impairments of $341 million which are
    nearly all related to writedowns of non-redeemable preferred
    securities, included in non-redeemable preferred stock.

2008 Impairments — Summary of Fixed Maturity
    Security Impairments.

Overall impairments of fixed maturity
    securities were $1.3 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. This substantial increase over the prior
    year was driven by impairments of: 1) $673 million on
    financial services industry fixed maturity security holdings as
    described previously; 2) $241 million were on
    communication and consumer industries holdings;
    3) $164 million on asset-backed (substantially all are
    backed by or exposed to sub-prime mortgage loans) and below
    investment grade commercial mortgage-backed holdings; and
    4) $218 million in fixed maturity security holdings
    that the Company either lacked the intent to hold, or due to
    extensive credit spread widening, the Company was uncertain of
    its intent to hold these fixed maturity securities for a period
    of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the market value
    decline Overall, $1.1 billion of the impairments were
    considered to be credit-related and are included in the
    $1.2 billion of credit-related impairments of fixed
    maturities and equity securities described previously.

2008 Impairments — Summary of Equity Security
    Impairments.

Equity security impairments recorded in 2008
    totaled $430 million. Included within the $430 million
    of impairments on equity securities in 2008 are
    $341 million related to the financial services industry
    holdings, (of which, $90 million related to the financial
    services industry non-redeemable preferred securities) and
    $89 million across several industries including consumer,
    communications, industrial and utility. As described previously,
    $117 million of these equity security impairments related
    to Lehman, Washington Mutual and AIG. As a result of the
    Company’s equity securities impairment review process,
    which included a review of the duration of, and or the severity
    of the unrealized loss position of its equity securities
    holdings, additional other-than-temporary impairment charges
    totaling $313 million were recorded for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. These additional impairments were
    principally related to impairments on non-redeemable trust
    preferred securities holdings of financial services industry
    securities holdings that had either been in an unrealized loss
    position for an extended duration (i.e., 12 months or
    more), or were in a severe unrealized loss position. In fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Company not only considered the severity
    and duration of unrealized losses on its non-redeemable
    preferred security holdings, but placed greater weight and
    emphasis on whether there has been any credit deterioration in
    the issuer of these holdings in accordance with recent published
    guidance. Overall, $90 million of the impairments were
    considered to be credit related and are included in the
    $1.2 billion of credit related impairments of fixed
    maturity and equity securities described previously.

Future Impairments.

Future other-than-temporary
    impairments will depend primarily on economic fundamentals,
    issuer performance, changes in collateral valuation, changes in
    interest rates, and changes in credit spreads. If economic
    fundamentals and other of the above factors continue to
    deteriorate, additional other-than-temporary impairments may be
    incurred in upcoming periods. See also “ —

The Company maintains a diversified corporate fixed maturity
    portfolio across industries and issuers. The portfolio does not
    have exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of the total
    invested assets of the portfolio. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, the Company’s combined holdings in the ten issuers to
    which it had the greatest exposure totaled $8.4 billion and
    $7.8 billion, respectively, the total of these ten issuers
    being less than 3% of the Company’s total invested assets
    at such dates. The exposure to the largest single issuer of
    corporate fixed maturity securities held at December 31,
    2008 and 2007 was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion,
    respectively.

The Company has hedged all of its material exposure to foreign
    currency risk in its corporate fixed maturity portfolio. In the
    Company’s international insurance operations, both its
    assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local
    currencies.

Collateralized mortgage obligations are a type of
    mortgage-backed security that creates separate pools or tranches
    of pass-through cash flows for different classes of bondholders
    with varying maturities. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities
    are a type of asset-backed security that is secured by a
    mortgage or collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage
    payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through
    an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank,
    which collects the payments, and for fee, remits or passes these
    payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.



Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities.

At
    December 31, 2008, the exposures in the Company’s
    residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio consist of
    agency, prime, and alternative residential mortgage loans
    (“Alt-A”) securities of 68%, 23%, and 9% of the total
    holdings, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    $33.3 billion and $54.7 billion, respectively, or 92%
    and 99% respectively, of the residential mortgage-backed
    securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody’s, S&P or
    Fitch. The majority of the agency residential mortgage-backed
    securities are guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal
    National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
    Corporation or the Government National Mortgage Association.
    Prime residential mortgage lending includes the origination of
    residential mortgage loans to the most credit-worthy customers
    with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A residential mortgage
    loans are a classification of mortgage loans where the risk
    profile of the borrower falls between prime and sub-prime. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities exposure was
    $3.4 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, with an
    unrealized loss of $1,963 million and $139 million,
    respectively. At December 31, 2008 and December 31,
    2007, $2.1 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, or
    63% and 99%, respectively, of the Company’s Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities were rated Aa/AA or
    better by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch; At December 31,
    2008 the Company’s Alt-A holdings are distributed as
    follows: 23% 2007 vintage year, 25% 2006 vintage year; and 52%
    in the 2005 and prior vintage years. Vintage year refers to the
    year of origination and not to the year of purchase. In December
    2008, certain Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities
    experienced ratings downgrades from investment grade to below
    investment grade, contributing to the decrease year over year
    cited above in those securities rated Aa/AA or better. In
    January 2009 Moody’s revised its loss projections for Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities, and the Company
    anticipates that Moody’s will be downgrading virtually all
    2006 and 2007 vintage year Alt-A securities to below investment
    grade, which will increase the percentage of our Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio that will be
    rated below investment grade. Our analysis suggests that
    Moody’s is applying essentially the same default
    methodology to all Alt-A bonds, regardless of the underlying
    collateral. The Company’s Alt-A portfolio has superior
    structure to the overall Alt-A market. The Company’s Alt-A
    portfolio is 88% fixed rate collateral, has zero exposure to
    option ARM mortgages and has only 12% hybrid ARMs. Fixed rate
    mortgages have performed better than both option ARMs and hybrid
    ARMs. Additionally, 83% of the Company’s Alt-A portfolio
    has super senior credit enhancement, which typically provides
    double the credit enhancement of a standard AAA rated bond.
    Based upon the analysis of the Company’s exposure to Alt-A
    mortgage loans through its investment in asset-backed
    securities, the Company continues to expect to receive payments
    in accordance with the contractual terms of the securities.

Asset-Backed Securities.

The Company’s
    asset-backed securities are diversified both by sector and by
    issuer. At December 31, 2008, the largest exposures in the
    Company’s asset-backed securities portfolio were credit
    card receivables, automobile receivables, student loan
    receivables and residential mortgage-backed securities backed by
    sub-prime mortgage loans of 49%, 10%, 10% and 10% of the total
    holdings, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s holdings in asset-backed securities was
    $10.5 billion and $10.6 billion at estimated fair
    value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $7.9 billion and
    $5.7 billion, respectively, or 75% and 54%, respectively,
    of total asset-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch.

The Company’s asset-backed securities included in the
    structured securities table above include exposure to
    residential mortgage-backed securities backed by sub-prime
    mortgage loans. Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of
    residential mortgage loans to customers with weak credit
    profiles. The Company’s exposure exists through investment
    in asset-backed securities which are supported by sub-prime
    mortgage loans. The slowing U.S. housing market, greater
    use of affordable mortgage products, and relaxed underwriting
    standards for some originators of below-prime loans have
    recently led to higher delinquency and loss rates, especially
    within the 2006 and 2007 vintage year. Vintage year refers to
    the year of origination and not to the year of purchase. These
    factors have caused a pull-back in market liquidity and
    repricing of risk, which has led to an increase in unrealized
    losses from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008.
    Based upon the analysis of the Company’s exposure to
    sub-prime mortgage loans through its investment in asset-backed
    securities, the Company expects to receive payments in
    accordance with the contractual terms of the securities.



The following table shows the Company’s exposure to
    asset-backed securities supported by sub-prime mortgage loans by
    credit quality and by vintage year:

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had asset-backed
    securities supported by sub-prime mortgage loans with estimated
    fair values of $1.1 billion and $2.0 billion,
    respectively, and unrealized losses of $730 million and
    $198 million, respectively, as outlined in the tables
    above. At December 31, 2008, approximately 82% of the
    portfolio is rated Aa or better of which 82% was in vintage year
    2005 and prior. At December 31, 2007, approximately 98% of
    the portfolio was rated Aa or better of which 79% was in vintage
    year 2005 and prior. These older vintages benefit from better
    underwriting, improved enhancement levels and higher residential
    property price appreciation. At December 31, 2008, 37% of
    the asset-backed securities backed by sub-prime mortgage loans
    have been guaranteed by financial guarantee insurers, of which
    19% and 37% were guaranteed by financial guarantee insurers who
    were Aa and Baa rated, respectively. At December 31, 2008,
    all of the $1.1 billion of asset-backed securities
    supported by sub-prime mortgage loans were classified as
    Level 3 securities.

Asset-backed securities also include collateralized debt
    obligations backed by sub-prime mortgage loans at an aggregate
    cost of $20 million with an estimated fair value of
    $10 million at December 31, 2008 and an aggregate cost
    of $63 million with an estimated fair value of
    $47 million at December 31, 2007, which are not
    included in the tables above.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities.

There
    have been disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed
    securities market due to market perceptions that default rates
    will increase in part due weakness in commercial real estate
    market fundamentals and due in part to relaxed underwriting
    standards by some originators of commercial mortgage loans
    within the more recent vintage years (i.e. 2006 and later).
    These factors have caused a pull-back in market liquidity,
    increased spreads and repricing of risk, which has led to an
    increase in unrealized losses since third



quarter 2008. Based upon the analysis of the Company’s
    exposure to commercial mortgage-backed securities, the Company
    expects to receive payments in accordance with the contractual
    terms of the securities.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s holdings
    in commercial mortgage-backed securities was $12.6 billion
    and $17.0 billion, respectively, at estimated fair value.
    At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $11.8 billion and
    $14.9 billion, respectively, of the estimated fair value,
    or 93% and 88%, respectively, of the commercial mortgage-backed
    securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody’s, S&P, or
    Fitch. At December 31, 2008, the rating distribution of the
    Company’s commercial mortgage-backed securities holdings
    was as follows: 93% Aaa, 4% Aa, 1% A, 1% Baa, and 1% Ba or
    below. At December 31, 2008, 84% of the holdings are in the
    2005 and prior vintage years. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had no exposure to CMBX securities and its holdings of
    commercial real estate debt obligations securities was
    $121 million at estimated fair value. The weighted average
    credit enhancement of the Company’s commercial
    mortgage-backed securities holdings at December 31, 2008
    was 26%. This credit enhancement percentage represents the
    current weighted average estimated percentage of outstanding
    capital structure subordinated to the Company’s investment
    holding that is available to absorb losses before the security
    incurs the first dollar of loss of principal. The credit
    protection does not include any equity interest or property
    value in excess of outstanding debt.

The following table shows the Company’s exposure to
    commercial mortgage-backed securities by credit quality and by
    vintage year:

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities, and short-term investments are loaned to third
    parties, primarily major brokerage firms



and commercial banks. The Company generally requires collateral
    equal to 102% of the current estimated fair value of the loaned
    securities to be obtained at the inception of a loan, and
    maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the
    duration of the loan. During the extraordinary market events
    occurring in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company, in limited
    instances, accepted collateral less than 102% at the inception
    of certain loans, but never less than 100%, of the estimated
    fair value of such loaned securities. These loans involved
    U.S. Government Treasury Bills which are considered to have
    limited variation in their estimated fair value during the term
    of the loan. Securities with a cost or amortized cost of
    $20.8 billion and $41.1 billion and an estimated fair
    value of $22.9 billion and $42.1 billion were on loan
    under the program at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Securities loaned under such transactions may be
    sold or repledged by the transferee. The Company was liable for
    cash collateral under its control of $23.3 billion and
    $43.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Of this $23.3 billion of cash collateral at
    December 31, 2008, $5.1 billion was on open terms,
    meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to
    the Company on the next business day requiring return of cash
    collateral and $14.7 billion and $3.5 billion,
    respectively were due within 30 days and 60 days. The
    estimated fair value of the securities related to the cash
    collateral on open at December 31, 2008 has been reduced to
    $5.0 billion from $15.8 billion as of
    November 30, 2008. Of the $5.0 billion of estimated
    fair value of the securities related to the cash collateral on
    open at December 31, 2008, $4.4 billion were
    U.S. Treasury and agency securities which, if put to the
    Company, can be immediately sold to satisfy the cash
    requirements. The remainder of the securities on loan are
    primarily U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and very
    liquid residential mortgage-backed securities. Within the
    U.S. Treasury securities on loan, they are primarily
    holdings of on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities, the most
    liquid U.S. Treasury securities available. If these high
    quality securities that are on loan are put back to the Company,
    the proceeds from immediately selling these securities can be
    used to satisfy the related cash requirements. The estimated
    fair value of the reinvestment portfolio acquired with the cash
    collateral was $19.5 billion at December 31, 2008, and
    consisted principally of fixed maturity securities (including
    residential mortgage-backed, asset-backed, U.S. corporate
    and foreign corporate securities). If the on loan securities or
    the reinvestment portfolio become less liquid, the Company has
    the liquidity resources of most of its general account available
    to meet any potential cash demand when securities are put back
    to the Company.

The following table represents, at December 31, 2008, when
    the Company may be obligated to return cash collateral received
    in connection with its securities lending program. Cash
    collateral is required to be returned when the related loaned
    security is returned to the Company.

    in the consolidated financial statements.

Assets
    on Deposit, Held in Trust and Pledged as
    Collateral

The Company had investment assets on deposit with regulatory
    agencies with an estimated fair value of $1.3 billion and
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, consisting primarily of fixed maturity and equity
    securities. The Company also held in trust cash and securities,
    primarily fixed maturity and equity securities, with an
    estimated fair value of $9.3 billion and $5.9 billion
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to satisfy
    collateral requirements. The Company has also pledged certain
    fixed maturity securities in support of the collateral financing
    arrangements described in Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements
    ‘‘— Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — The Company — Liquidity and
    Capital Uses — Collateral Financing Arrangements.”

The Company has pledged fixed maturity securities and mortgage
    loans in support of its debt and funding agreements with the
    FHLB of New York and the FHLB of Boston of $22.2 billion
    and $7.0 billion at December 31,



2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company has also pledged
    certain agricultural real estate mortgage loans in connection
    with funding agreements with the Federal Agricultural Mortgage
    Corporation with a carrying value of $2.9 billion at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company has also pledged
    qualifying mortgage loans and securities in connection with
    collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York’s Term Auction Facility with an estimated fair value
    of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The nature of
    these Federal Home Loan Bank, and Federal Agricultural Mortgage
    Corporation and Federal Reserve Bank of New York arrangements
    are described in Notes 7 and 10 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Certain of the Company’s invested assets are pledged as
    collateral for various derivative transactions as described in
    “— Composition of Investment Portfolio
    Results — Derivative Financial Instruments —
    Credit Risk.” Certain of the Company’s trading
    securities are pledged to secure liabilities associated with
    short sale agreements in the trading securities portfolio as
    described in the following section.

Trading
    Securities

The Company has trading securities portfolios to support
    investment strategies that involve the active and frequent
    purchase and sale of securities, the execution of short sale
    agreements and asset and liability matching strategies for
    certain insurance products. Trading securities and short sale
    agreement liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value with
    subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net
    investment income.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, trading securities at
    estimated fair value were $946 million and
    $779 million, respectively, and liabilities associated with
    the short sale agreements in the trading securities portfolio,
    which were included in other liabilities, were $57 million
    and $107 million, respectively. The Company had pledged
    $346 million and $407 million of its assets, at
    estimated fair value, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Interest and dividends earned on trading securities in addition
    to the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on
    the trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities included within net investment income totaled
    ($193) million, $50 million and $71 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Included within unrealized gains (losses) on such
    trading securities and short sale agreement liabilities are
    changes in estimated fair value of ($174) million,
    ($4) million and $26 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008,
    unrealized losses recognized for trading securities, due to
    volatility in the equity and credit markets, were in excess of
    interest and dividends earned.

The trading securities measured at estimated fair value on a
    recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy,
    are summarized as follows:

Mortgage
    and Consumer Loans

The Company’s mortgage and consumer loans are principally
    collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential
    properties, as well as automobiles. Mortgage and consumer loans
    comprised 15.9% and 14.1% of the Company’s total cash and
    invested assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The carrying value of mortgage and consumer loans
    is stated at original cost net of repayments, amortization of
    premiums, accretion of discounts and valuation allowances,
    except for residential mortgage loans held-for-sale accounted
    for under the fair value option which are carried at estimated
    fair value, as determined on a recurring basis and certain
    commercial and residential mortgage loans carried at the lower
    of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on a nonrecurring
    basis. The following table shows the carrying value of the

At December 31, 2008, mortgage loans held-for-sale include
    $1,975 million of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale
    carried under the fair value option. At December 31, 2008
    and 2007, mortgage loans held-for-sale also include
    $37 million and $5 million, respectively, of
    commercial and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale which
    are carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair
    value.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held $220 million in
    mortgage loans which are carried at estimated fair value based
    on the value of the underlying collateral or independent broker
    quotations, if lower, of which $188 million relate to
    impaired mortgage loans held-for-investment and $32 million
    to certain mortgage loans held-for-sale. These impaired mortgage
    loans were recorded at estimated fair value and represent a
    nonrecurring fair value measurement. The estimated fair value is
    categorized as Level 3. Included within net investment
    gains (losses) for such impaired mortgage loans are net
    impairments of $79 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Restructured, Potentially Delinquent, Delinquent or Under
    Foreclosure.

The Company monitors its mortgage
    loan investments on an ongoing basis, including reviewing loans
    that are restructured, potentially delinquent, delinquent or
    under foreclosure. These loan classifications are consistent
    with those used in industry practice.

The Company defines restructured mortgage loans as loans in
    which the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the
    debtor’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
    debtor that it would not otherwise consider. The Company defines
    potentially delinquent loans as loans that, in management’s
    opinion, have a high probability of becoming delinquent. The
    Company defines delinquent mortgage loans, consistent with
    industry practice, as loans in which two or more interest or
    principal payments are past due. The Company defines mortgage
    loans under foreclosure as loans in which foreclosure
    proceedings have formally commenced.

The Company reviews all mortgage loans on an ongoing basis.
    These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial
    statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property
    inspections, market analysis and tenant creditworthiness.

The Company records valuation allowances for certain of the
    loans that it deems impaired. The Company’s valuation
    allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for
    those loans where a property or market specific risk has been
    identified that could likely result in a future default, as well
    as for pools of loans with similar high risk characteristics
    where a property specific or market risk has not been
    identified. Loan specific valuation allowances are established
    for the excess carrying value of the mortgage loan over the
    present value of expected future cash



flows discounted at the loan’s original effective interest
    rate, the value of the loan’s collateral, or the
    loan’s estimated fair value if the loan is being sold.
    Valuation allowances for pools of loans are established based on
    property types and loan to value risk factors. The Company
    records valuation allowances as investment losses. The Company
    records subsequent adjustments to allowances as investment gains
    (losses).

Recent economic events causing deteriorating market conditions,
    low levels of liquidity and credit spread widening have all
    adversely impacted the mortgage and consumer loan markets. As a
    result, commercial real estate, agricultural and residential
    loan market fundamentals have weakened. The Company expects
    continued pressure on these fundamentals, including but not
    limited to declining rent growth, increased vacancies, rising
    delinquencies and declining property values. These deteriorating
    factors have been considered in the Company’s ongoing,
    systematic and comprehensive review of the mortgage and consumer
    loan portfolios, resulting in higher writedown amounts and
    valuation allowances for 2008.

Agricultural Mortgage Loans.

The Company
    diversifies its agricultural mortgage loans held-for-investment
    by both geographic region and product type.

Of the $12.2 billion of agricultural mortgage loans
    outstanding at December 31, 2008, 56% were subject to rate
    resets prior to maturity. A substantial portion of these loans
    has been successfully renegotiated and remain outstanding to
    maturity. The process and policies for monitoring the
    agricultural mortgage loans and classifying them by performance
    status are generally the same as those for the commercial loans.

Real
    Estate Holdings

The Company’s real estate holdings consist of commercial
    properties located primarily in the United States. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the carrying value of the
    Company’s real estate, real estate joint ventures and real
    estate held-for-sale was $7.6 billion and
    $6.8 billion, respectively, or 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively,
    of total cash and invested assets. The carrying value of real
    estate is stated at depreciated cost net of impairments and
    valuation allowances. The carrying value of real estate joint
    ventures is stated at the Company’s equity in the real
    estate joint ventures net of impairments and valuation
    allowances.

The Company diversifies its real estate holdings by both
    geographic region and property type to reduce risk of
    concentration. The Company’s real estate holdings are
    primarily located in the United States. At December 31,
    2008, 22%, 13%, 11% and 8% of the Company’s real estate
    holdings were located in California, Florida, New York and
    Texas, respectively. Property type diversification is shown in

The Company’s carrying value of real estate held-for-sale
    of $1 million and $39 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, have been reduced by impairments of
    $1 million at both December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The Company records real estate acquired upon foreclosure of
    commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at the lower of
    estimated fair value or the carrying value of the mortgage loan
    at the date of foreclosure.

Net investment income from real estate joint ventures and funds
    within the real estate and real estate joint venture caption
    represents distributions from investees accounted for under the
    cost method and equity in earnings from investees accounted for
    under the equity method. For the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, net investment income from real estate and
    real estate joint ventures was $581 million,
    $950 million and $777 million, respectively. Net
    investment income from real estate and real estate joint
    ventures decreased by $369 million for the year ended 2008
    due to volatility in the real estate markets. Management
    anticipates that the significant volatility in the real estate
    markets will continue in 2009 which could continue to impact net
    investment income and the related yields on real estate and real
    estate joint ventures. For equity method real estate joint
    ventures and funds, the Company reports the equity in earnings
    based on the availability of financial statements and other
    periodic financial information that are substantially the same
    as financial statements. Accordingly, those financial statements
    are reviewed on a lag basis after the close of the joint
    ventures’ or funds’ financial reporting periods, and
    the Company records the equity in earnings, generally on a one
    reporting period lag. In addition, due to the lag in reporting
    of the joint ventures’ and funds’ results to the
    Company, volatility in the equity and credit markets experienced
    in late 2008, is expected to unfavorably impact net investment
    income in 2009, as those results are reported to the Company.

Other
    Limited Partnership Interests

The carrying value of other limited partnership interests (which
    primarily represent ownership interests in pooled investment
    funds that principally make private equity investments in
    companies in the United States and overseas) was
    $6.0 billion and $6.2 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Included within other limited
    partnership interests at December 31, 2008 and 2007 are
    $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of hedge
    funds. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for
    investments in limited partnership interests in which it has
    more than a minor interest, has influence over the
    partnership’s operating and financial policies, but does
    not have a controlling interest and is not the primary
    beneficiary. The Company uses the cost method for minor interest
    investments and when it has virtually no influence over the
    partnership’s operating and financial policies. For equity
    method limited partnership interests, the Company reports the
    equity in earnings based on the availability of financial
    statements and other periodic financial information that are
    substantially the same as financial statements. Accordingly,
    those financial statements are reviewed on a lag basis after the
    close of the partnerships’ financial reporting periods, and
    the Company records the equity in earnings, generally on a one
    reporting period lag. In



addition, due to the lag in reporting of the partnerships’
    results to the Company, volatility in the equity and credit
    markets experienced in late 2008, is expected to unfavorably
    impact net investment income in 2009, as those results are
    reported to the Company. The Company’s investments in other
    limited partnership interests represented 1.9% and 1.9% of cash
    and invested assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, net
    investment income (loss) from other limited partnership
    interests was ($170) million, $1,309 million and
    $945 million, respectively. Net investment income from
    other limited partnership interests, including hedge funds,
    decreased by $1,479 million for the year ended 2008, due to
    volatility in the equity and credit markets. Management
    anticipates that the significant volatility in the equity and
    credit markets will continue in 2009 which could continue to
    impact net investment income and the related yields on other
    limited partnership interests. In addition, due to the lag in
    reporting of the partnership results to the Company, volatility
    in the equity and credit markets incurred in late 2008, is
    expected to unfavorably impact net investment income in 2009, as
    those results are reported to the Company.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held $137 million in
    cost basis other limited partnership interests which were
    impaired during the year ended December 31, 2008 based on
    the underlying limited partnership financial statements.
    Consistent with equity securities, greater weight and
    consideration is given in the other limited partnership
    interests impairment review process, to the severity and
    duration of unrealized losses on such other limited partnership
    interests holdings. These other limited partnership interests
    were recorded at estimated fair value and represent a
    nonrecurring fair value measurement. The estimated fair value
    was categorized as Level 3. Included within net investment
    gains (losses) for such other limited partnerships are
    impairments of $105 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

The Company recognizes the rights to service residential
    mortgage loans as mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”).
    MSRs are either acquired or are generated from the sale of
    originated residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights
    are retained by the Company. MSRs are carried at estimated fair
    value and changes in estimated fair value, primarily due to
    changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the
    collection of expected cash flows, are reported in other
    revenues in the period in which the change occurs. See also
    Notes 1 and 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information about the how the estimated
    fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined and other
    related information.



Short-term
    Investments

The carrying value of short-term investments, which include
    investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but
    greater than three months, at the time of acquisition and are
    stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair
    value, was $13.9 billion and $2.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives.

The Company uses a variety of
    derivatives, including swaps, forwards, futures and option
    contracts, to manage its various risks. Additionally, the
    Company uses derivatives to synthetically create investments as
    permitted by its insurance subsidiaries’ Derivatives Use
    Plans approved by the applicable state insurance departments.

The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of
    significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher
    degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations
    of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although
    Level 3 inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate
    given the circumstances and are consistent with what other
    market participants would use when pricing such instruments, the
    use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives
    and could materially affect net income.

Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at December 31,
    2008 include: financial forwards including swap spread locks
    with maturities which extend beyond observable periods; interest
    rate lock commitments with certain



unobservable inputs, including pull-through rates; equity
    variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs or that are
    priced via independent broker quotations; foreign currency swaps
    which are cancelable and priced through independent broker
    quotations; interest rate swaps with maturities which extend
    beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; credit default
    swaps based upon baskets of credits having unobservable credit
    correlations as well as credit default swaps with maturities
    which extend beyond the observable portion of the credit curves
    and credit default swaps priced through independent broker
    quotes; foreign currency forwards priced via independent broker
    quotations or with liquidity adjustments; equity options with
    unobservable volatility inputs; and interest rate caps and
    floors referencing unobservable yield curves

and/or

which
    include liquidity and volatility adjustments.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, 2.7% and 1.5% of the net
    derivative estimated fair value was priced via independent
    broker quotations.

    the amounts reported above.

Credit Risk.

The Company may be exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally,
    the current credit exposure of the Company’s derivative
    contracts is limited to the net positive estimated fair value of
    derivative contracts at the reporting date after taking into
    consideration the existence of netting agreements and any
    collateral received pursuant to credit support annexes.

The Company manages its credit risk related to over-the-counter
    derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange-traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. At December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the Company was obligated to return cash
    collateral under its control of $7,758 million and
    $833 million, respectively. This unrestricted cash
    collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents or in
    short-term investments and the obligation to return it is
    included in payables for collateral under securities loaned and
    other transactions. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had also accepted collateral consisting of various
    securities with an estimated fair value of $1,249 million
    and $678 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, none of the collateral had been sold or repledged.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company provided
    securities collateral for various arrangements in connection
    with derivative instruments of $776 million and
    $162 million, respectively, which is included in fixed
    maturity securities. The counterparties are permitted by
    contract to sell or repledge this collateral. In addition, the
    Company has exchange-traded futures, which require the pledging
    of collateral. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    pledged securities collateral for exchange-traded futures of
    $282 million and $167 million, respectively, which is
    included in fixed maturity securities. The counterparties are
    permitted by contract to sell or repledge this collateral. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company provided cash
    collateral for exchange-traded futures of $686 million and
    $102 million, respectively, which is included in premiums
    and other receivables.

In connection with synthetically created investment transactions
    and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading
    portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it
    receives a premium to insure credit risk. If a credit event, as
    defined by the contract, occurs generally the contract will
    require the Company to pay the counterparty the specified swap
    notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities
    of the referenced credit obligation. The Company’s maximum
    amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit
    obligations is zero, was $1,875 million at
    December 31, 2008. However, the Company believes that any
    actual future losses will be significantly lower than this
    amount. Additionally, the Company can terminate these contracts
    at any time through cash settlement with the counterparty at an
    amount equal to the then current estimated fair value of the
    credit default swaps. At December 31, 2008, the Company
    would have paid $37 million to terminate all of these
    contracts.

(2)

The maximum exposure to loss relating to the fixed maturity
    securities available-for-sale and equity securities
    available-for-sale is equal to the carrying amounts or carrying
    amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss
    relating to the real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnership interests is equal to the carrying amounts plus any
    unfunded commitments. Such a maximum loss would be expected to
    occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. For
    certain of its investments in other invested assets, the
    Company’s return is in the form of tax credits which are
    guaranteed by a creditworthy third party. For such investments,
    the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts
    plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by amounts guaranteed by
    third parties.

As discussed in Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, the Company makes commitments to fund
    partnership investments in the normal course of business.
    Excluding these commitments, MetLife did not provide financial
    or other support to investees designated as VIEs during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

    investment risk, at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The Company manages each separate account’s
    assets in accordance with the prescribed investment policy that
    applies to that specific separate account. The Company
    establishes separate accounts on a single client and
    multi-client commingled basis in compliance with insurance laws.
    Effective with the adoption of

SOP 03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
    Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate
    Accounts

, on January 1, 2004, the Company reported
    separately, as assets and liabilities, investments held in
    separate accounts and liabilities of the separate accounts if:

•

such separate accounts are legally recognized;

•

assets supporting the contract liabilities are legally insulated
    from the Company’s general account liabilities;

•

investments are directed by the contractholder; and

•

all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder.

The Company reports separate account assets meeting such
    criteria at their estimated fair value. Investment performance
    (including net investment income, net investment gains (losses)
    and changes in unrealized gains (losses)) and the corresponding
    amounts credited to contractholders of such separate accounts
    are offset within the same line in the consolidated statements
    of income.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges. Separate accounts not meeting the above criteria are
    combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses.

The separate accounts measured at estimated fair value on a
    recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy,
    are summarized as follows:

Policyholder
    Liabilities

The Company establishes, and carries as liabilities, actuarially
    determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy
    obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered, an insured
    dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered
    events, or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for
    actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the
    consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For
    more details on Policyholder Liabilities see
    “— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Critical Accounting Estimates.” Also see —

Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of
    uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial
    liabilities, the Company cannot precisely determine the amounts
    that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial
    liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the
    estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur
    until well into the future.

However, we believe our actuarial liabilities for future
    benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to
    be paid to policyholders. We periodically review our estimates
    of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them
    with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent
    permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future
    expected experience differs from assumptions used in the
    development of actuarial liabilities.

The Company has experienced, and will likely in the future
    experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism,
    and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact
    on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
    Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including
    pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes,
    explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing
    water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such
    as terrorist attacks. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the
    incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from
    catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of
    catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk
    from these perils.

Future
    Policy Benefits

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies. Generally, amounts are payable over an
    extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated
    as the present value of expected future benefits to be paid,
    reduced by the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Such liabilities are established



based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits include mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, investment returns, inflation, expenses and other
    contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type.
    These assumptions are established at the time the policy is
    issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the
    period the policy benefits are payable. Utilizing these
    assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of business
    basis. If experience is less favorable than assumed and future
    losses are projected under loss recognition testing, then
    additional liabilities may be required, resulting in a charge to
    policyholder benefits and claims.

Group Life.

Future policy benefits are
    comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under
    disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for
    survivor income benefit insurance, and premium stabilization and
    other contingency liabilities held under participating group
    life insurance contracts.

Retirement & Savings.

Liabilities
    are primarily related to retirement and structured settlement
    annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on
    these liabilities. A sustained low interest rate environment
    could negatively impact earnings as a result. The Company has
    various derivative positions, primarily interest rate floors and
    interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risks associated with such
    a scenario.

Non-Medical Health & Other.

Future
    policy benefits are comprised mainly of provisions for
    liabilities for disabled lives under group long-term disability,
    individual disability, and long-term care policies, active life
    liabilities under long-term care and individual disability
    policies. The Company entered into various derivative positions,
    primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions, to mitigate the
    risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of
    maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates
    below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts.

Traditional Life.

Future policy benefits
    mostly relate to participating whole life policies and
    endowments (including the closed block). The remainder support
    liabilities for term life policies. The Company has often
    reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new individual life
    insurance policies. The reinsurance programs are routinely
    evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to
    existing coverage.

Variable & Universal Life.

Future policy
    benefits are comprised mainly of reserves for mortality and

SOP 03-1

liabilities related to universal life secondary guarantees. In
    order to manage risk, the Company has often reinsured a portion
    of the mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies.
    The reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may
    result in increases or decreases to existing coverage.

Annuities.

Future policy benefits are
    comprised mainly of reserves for life-contingent income
    annuities, supplemental contracts with and without life
    contingencies, reserves for Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits
    (“GMDBs”) included in certain annuity contracts, and a
    certain portion of guaranteed living benefits.

See“—Variable

Annuity Guarantees.”

International.

Future policy benefits are held
    primarily for immediate annuities in Latin America, as well as
    for total return pass-thru provisions included in certain
    universal life and savings products in Latin America, and
    traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts sold in
    various countries in the Asia Pacific region. They also include

SOP 03-1

liabilities for variable annuity guarantees of minimum death
    benefits, and longevity guarantees sold in the Asia Pacific
    region. Finally, in the European region, they also include
    unearned premium liabilities established for credit insurance
    contracts covering death, disability and involuntary loss of
    employment, as well as a small amount of traditional life and
    endowment contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include
    sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at
    issue, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, asset
    default and more rapid improvement of mortality levels than
    anticipated for life contingent immediate annuities. The Company
    mitigates its risks by implementing an asset/liability matching
    policy and through the development of periodic experience
    studies. See “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

Auto & Home.

Future policy benefits
    include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for
    property and casualty insurance and represent the amount
    estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and
    claims incurred but not reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims
    are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim
    frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends,
    legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are
    based upon the Company’s historical experience and analyses
    of historical development



patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to
    losses for each line of business, and consider the effects of
    current developments, anticipated trends and risk management
    programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.

Estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim
    expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these
    changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of
    operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of
    prior year losses.

Corporate & Other.

Future policy benefits
    primarily include liabilities for quota-share reinsurance
    agreements for certain long-term care and workers’
    compensation business written by MICC, a subsidiary of the
    Company, prior to the acquisition of MICC. These run-off
    businesses have been included within Corporate & Other
    since the acquisition of MICC.

Policyholder
    Account Balances

Policyholder account balances are generally equal to the account
    value, which includes accrued interest credited, but exclude the
    impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred
    upon surrender.

Group Life.

Policyholder account balances are
    held for death benefit disbursement retained asset accounts,
    universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life
    insurance policies, and specialized life insurance products for
    benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited
    interest at a rate set by the Company, which are influenced by
    current market rates. The majority of the policyholder account
    balances have a guaranteed minimum credited rate between 1.5%
    and 4.0%. A sustained low interest rate environment could
    negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited
    rate guarantees. The Company has various derivative positions,
    primarily interest rate floors, to partially mitigate the risks
    associated with such a scenario.

Retirement & Savings.

Policyholder
    account balances are comprised of funding agreements, GICs and
    Global GICs (“GGICs”). Interest crediting rates vary
    by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable
    interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external
    index, most commonly

1-month

or

3-month

LIBOR. MetLife is exposed to interest rate risks, and foreign
    exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return
    of principal at the contractual maturity date. The Company may
    invest in floating rate assets, or enter into floating rate
    swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as caps to
    mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. The
    Company also mitigates its risks by implementing an
    asset/liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign
    currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges,
    including cross currency swaps.

Variable & Universal
    Life.

Policyholder account balances are held for
    general account universal life policies, and the fixed account
    of variable life insurance policies. Policyholder account
    balances are credited interest at a rate set by the Company, and
    are influenced by current market rates. These contracts
    generally have a guaranteed minimum credited rate. The majority
    of the policyholder account balances have a minimum credited
    rate between 3% and 5%.

Annuities.

Policyholder account balances are
    held for fixed deferred annuities and the fixed account portion
    of variable annuities, for certain income annuities, and for
    certain portions of guaranteed benefits. Policyholder account
    balances are credited interest at a rate set by the Company,
    which are influenced by current market rates, and generally have
    a guaranteed minimum credited rate between 1.5% and 4.0%. See
    “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”

International.

Policyholder account balances
    are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans
    in Latin America and to a lesser degree, amounts for separate
    account type funds in certain countries in the Latin America,
    Europe, and Asia Pacific regions that do not meet the US GAAP
    definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain
    liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain
    countries in the Asia Pacific region that generally are sold
    with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for
    guarantees on certain variable annuities in the Asia Pacific
    region are established in accordance with SFAS 133 and are
    also included within policyholder account balances. These
    liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low
    interest rates, where there are interest rate guarantees. The
    Company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset/liability
    matching policy and by hedging its variable annuity guarantees.
    See “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.”



Variable
    Annuity Guarantees

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit that provide the policyholder a
    minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit
    base) less withdrawals. In some cases the benefit base may be
    increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or
    market value resets. These Guarantees are accounted for under

SOP 03-1

or as embedded derivatives under SFAS 133 depending on how
    and when the benefit is paid. Specifically, a guarantee is
    accounted for under SFAS 133 if a guarantee is paid without
    requiring (i) the occurrence of specific insurable event or
    (ii) the policyholder to annuitize. Alternatively, a
    guarantee is accounted for under

SOP 03-1

if a guarantee is paid only upon either (i) the occurrence
    of a specific insurable event or (ii) upon annuitization.
    In certain cases, a guarantee may have elements of both
    SFAS 133 and

SOP 03-1

and in such cases the guarantee is accounted for under a split
    of the two models.

The net amount at risk (“NAR”) for guarantees can
    change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained
    shifts in equity market performance, increased equity
    volatility, or changes in interest rates. The NAR disclosed in
    Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, represents management’s estimate of the current
    value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all
    exercised simultaneously as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. However, there are features, such as deferral
    periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death, that
    limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near
    future. None of the GMIB guarantees are eligible for a
    guaranteed annuitization prior to 2011.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as
    embedded derivatives under SFAS 133, are recorded at
    estimated fair value and included in policyholder account
    balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives
    include GMAB, the non life-contingent portion of GMWB and the
    portion of certain GMIB that do not require annuitization. For
    more detail on the determination of estimated fair value, see
    Note 24 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

The table below contains the carrying value for guarantees
    included in policyholder account balances:

Included in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 were losses of $2,677 million in
    embedded derivatives related to the change in estimated fair
    value of the above guarantees. Effective January 1, 2008,
    the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for at estimated
    fair value includes an adjustment for the Company’s own
    credit. In connection with this adjustment, gains of
    $2,994 million are included in the loss of
    $2,677 million in net investment gains (losses).

The estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded
    derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity
    volatility, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.
    Additionally, because the estimated fair value for guarantees
    accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for
    the Company’s own credit, a decrease in the Company’s
    credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to
    increase. Conversely, a widening of the Company’s credit
    spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease.
    The Company uses derivative instruments to mitigate the
    liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility of net
    income associated with these liabilities. The derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures,
    equity options and variance swaps, and interest rate swaps. The
    change in valuation arising from the Company’s own credit
    is not hedged.

Included in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 were gains of $3,440 million related
    to the change in estimated fair value of the above derivatives.

Guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for under

SOP 03-1

have liabilities established that are included in future policy
    benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include GMDBs,
    the life-contingent portion of certain GMWB, and the portion of
    GMIB that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued
    over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future
    expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed
    minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate
    account returns. The scenarios use best estimate assumptions
    consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition
    costs. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those
    previously projected or when current estimates of future
    assessments are lower than those previously projected, the

SOP 03-1

reserves will increase, resulting in a current period charge to
    net income. The opposite result occurs when the current
    estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously
    projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed
    those previously projected. At each reporting period, the
    Company updates the actual amount of business remaining
    in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the
    projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current
    period charge or increase to earnings.

The table below contains the carrying value for guarantees
    included in Future Policy Benefits:

Included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 is a charge of $502 million related
    to the change in liabilities for the above guarantees.

The carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as

SOP 03-1

liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable
    and sustained shifts in equity market performance, increased
    equity volatility, or changes in interest rates. The Company
    uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to
    mitigate the liability exposure, risk of loss and the volatility
    of net income associated with these liabilities. Derivative
    instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures.

Included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the
    hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 were gains of $182 million
    related to reinsurance treaties containing embedded derivatives
    carried at estimated fair value and gains of $331 million
    related to freestanding derivatives.



While the Company believes that the hedging strategies employed
    for guarantees included in both policyholder account balances
    and in future policy benefits, as well as other management
    actions, have mitigated the risks related to these benefits, the
    Company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event
    that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or
    unwilling to pay. Certain of the Company’s reinsurance
    agreements and derivative positions are collateralized and
    derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements,
    both of which, significantly reduces the exposure to
    counterparty risk. In addition, the Company is subject to the
    risk that hedging and other management procedures prove
    ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or
    mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces
    economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management
    techniques employed. Lastly, because the valuation of the
    guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an
    adjustment for the Company’s own credit that is not hedged,
    changes in the Company’s own credit may result in
    significant volatility in net income.

Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    (“LTC”) and dental claims as well as claims that have
    been reported but not yet settled. The liability for these
    claims is based on the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of
    settling all claims. The Company derives estimates for the
    development of incurred but not reported claims principally from
    actuarial analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims
    development for each line of business. The methods used to
    determine these estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments
    resulting from this continuous review process and differences
    between estimates and payments for claims are recognized in
    policyholder benefits and claims expense in the period in which
    the estimates are changed or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    deferred acquisition costs. Such amortization is recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Policyholder
    Dividends Payable

Policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related
    to dividends payable in the following calendar year on
    participating policies.

    Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Risk
    Management

The Company must effectively manage, measure and monitor the
    market risk associated with its assets and liabilities. It has
    developed an integrated process for managing risk, which it
    conducts through its Enterprise Risk Management Department,
    Asset/Liability Management Unit, Treasury Department and
    Investment Department along with the management of the business
    segments. The Company has established and implemented
    comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and
    business segment level to minimize the effects of potential
    market volatility.



The Company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate,
    equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As
    a result of that analysis, the Company has determined that the
    estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities are
    materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets.

Enterprise Risk Management.

MetLife has
    established several financial and non-financial senior
    management committees as part of its risk management process.
    These committees manage capital and risk positions, approve
    asset/liability management strategies and establish appropriate
    corporate business standards.

MetLife also has a separate Enterprise Risk Management
    Department, which is responsible for risk throughout MetLife and
    reports to MetLife’s Chief Risk Officer. The Enterprise
    Risk Management Department’s primary responsibilities
    consist of:

•

implementing a Board of Directors approved corporate risk
    framework, which outlines the Company’s approach for
    managing risk on an enterprise-wide basis;

•

developing policies and procedures for managing, measuring,
    monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the
    corporate risk framework;

•

establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels;

•

deploying capital on an economic capital basis; and

•

reporting on a periodic basis to the Finance and Risk Policy
    Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, and with
    respect to credit risk to the Investment Committee of the
    Company’s Board of Directors and various financial and
    non-financial senior management committees.

MetLife does not expect to make any material changes to its risk
    management practices in 2009.

Asset/Liability Management(ALM).

The Company
    actively manages its assets using an approach that balances
    quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity,
    concentration and investment return. The goals of the investment
    process are to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted
    investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring
    that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash
    flow and duration basis. The asset/liability management process
    is the shared responsibility of the Financial Risk Management
    and Asset/Liability Management Unit, Enterprise Risk Management,
    the Portfolio Management Unit, and the senior members of the
    operating business segments and is governed by the ALM
    Committee. The ALM Committee’s duties include reviewing and
    approving target portfolios, establishing investment guidelines
    and limits and providing oversight of the asset/liability
    management process on a periodic basis. The directives of the
    ALM Committee are carried out and monitored through ALM Working
    Groups which are set up to manage by product type.

MetLife establishes target asset portfolios for each major
    insurance product, which represent the investment strategies
    used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels
    of risk. These strategies are monitored through regular review
    of portfolio metrics, such as effective duration, yield curve
    sensitivity, convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration
    and credit quality by the ALM Working Groups. MetLife does not
    expect to make any material changes to its asset/liability
    management practices in 2009.

Market
    Risk Exposures

The Company has exposure to market risk through its insurance
    operations and investment activities. For purposes of this
    disclosure, “market risk” is defined as the risk of
    loss resulting from changes in interest rates, equity prices and
    foreign currency exchange rates.

Interest Rates.

The Company’s exposure to
    interest rate changes results most significantly from its
    holdings of fixed maturity securities, as well as its interest
    rate sensitive liabilities. The fixed maturity securities
    include U.S. and foreign government bonds, securities
    issued by government agencies, corporate bonds and
    mortgage-backed securities, all of which are mainly exposed to
    changes in medium- and long-term interest rates. The interest
    rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure
    include debt, policyholder account balances related to certain
    investment type contracts, and net embedded derivatives within
    liability host contracts which have the same type of



interest rate exposure (medium- and long-term interest rates) as
    fixed maturity securities. The Company employs product design,
    pricing and asset/liability management strategies to reduce the
    adverse effects of interest rate movements. Product design and
    pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or
    restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to
    reset credited rates for certain products. Asset/liability
    management strategies include the use of derivatives and
    duration mismatch limits. See “Risk Factors —
    Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our
    Profitability.”

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates.

The
    Company’s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar results from its
    holdings in

non-U.S. dollar

denominated fixed maturity and equity securities, mortgage and
    consumer loans, and certain liabilities, as well as through its
    investments in foreign subsidiaries. The principal currencies
    that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the
    Company’s investment portfolios are the Euro, the Canadian
    dollar and the British pound. The principal currencies that
    create foreign currency exchange risk in the Company’s
    liabilities are the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar
    and the Swiss franc. Selectively, the Company uses
    U.S. dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign
    currency liabilities. Through its investments in foreign
    subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company is primarily
    exposed to the Mexican peso, the Japanese yen, the South Korean
    won, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Chilean peso,
    the Australian dollar, the Argentine peso and the Hong Kong
    dollar. In addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps,
    forwards and options, in some countries, local surplus is held
    entirely or in part in U.S. dollar assets which further
    minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation
    risk. The Company has matched much of its foreign currency
    liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective
    foreign currency assets, thereby reducing its risk to foreign
    currency exchange rate fluctuation.

Equity Prices.

The Company has exposure to
    equity prices through certain liabilities that involve long-term
    guarantees on equity performance such as variable annuities with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders, certain policyholder account
    balances along with investments in equity securities. We manage
    this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our
    asset/liability management strategies including the dynamic
    hedging of certain variable annuity riders. The Company also
    manages equity price risk incurred in its investment portfolio
    through the use of derivatives. Equity exposures associated with
    other limited partnership interests are excluded from this
    section as they are not considered financial instruments under
    generally accepted accounting principles.

Management
    of Market Risk Exposures

The Company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest
    rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity price risk,
    including the use of derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Risk Management.

To manage
    interest rate risk, the Company analyzes interest rate risk
    using various models, including multi-scenario cash flow
    projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities
    and their supporting investments, including derivative
    instruments. These projections involve evaluating the potential
    gain or loss on most of the Company’s in-force business
    under various increasing and decreasing interest rate
    environments. The New York State Insurance Department
    regulations require that MetLife perform some of these analyses
    annually as part of MetLife’s review of the sufficiency of
    its regulatory reserves. For several of its legal entities, the
    Company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset
    portfolios for the purpose of asset/liability management and the
    allocation of investment income to product lines. For each
    segment, invested assets greater than or equal to the GAAP
    liabilities less the DAC asset and any non-invested assets
    allocated to the segment are maintained, with any excess swept
    to the surplus segment. The operating segments may reflect
    differences in legal entity, statutory line of business and any
    product market characteristic which may drive a distinct
    investment strategy with respect to duration, liquidity or
    credit quality of the invested assets. Certain smaller entities
    make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the
    investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of
    liabilities in those entities. The Company measures relative
    sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to
    changes in key assumptions utilizing Company models. These
    models reflect specific product characteristics and include
    assumptions based on current and anticipated experience
    regarding lapse, mortality and interest crediting rates. In
    addition, these models include asset cash flow projections
    reflecting interest payments, sinking fund payments, principal
    payments, bond calls, mortgage prepayments and defaults.



Common industry metrics, such as duration and convexity, are
    also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and
    liability values to changes in interest rates. In computing the
    duration of liabilities, consideration is given to all
    policyholder guarantees and to how the Company intends to set
    indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or
    dividends. Each asset portfolio has a duration target based on
    the liability duration and the investment objectives of that
    portfolio. Where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity
    of available assets, as is the case with certain retirement and
    non-medical health products, the Company may support such
    liabilities with equity investments, derivatives or curve
    mismatch strategies.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
    Management.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk
    is assumed primarily in three ways: investments in foreign
    subsidiaries, purchases of foreign currency denominated
    investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain
    insurance products.

•

The Company’s Treasury Department is responsible for
    managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries.
    Limits to exposures are established and monitored by the
    Treasury Department and managed by the Investment Department.

•

The Investment Department is responsible for managing the
    exposure to foreign currency investments. Exposure limits to
    unhedged foreign currency investments are incorporated into the
    standing authorizations granted to management by the Board of
    Directors and are reported to the Board of Directors on a
    periodic basis.

•

The lines of business are responsible for establishing limits
    and managing any foreign exchange rate exposure caused by the
    sale or issuance of insurance products.

MetLife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its
    foreign currency denominated fixed income investments, its
    equity exposure in subsidiaries and its foreign currency
    exposures caused by the sale of insurance products.

Equity Price Risk Management.

Equity price
    risk incurred through the issuance of variable annuities is
    managed by the Company’s Asset/Liability Management Unit in
    partnership with the Investment Department. Equity price risk is
    also incurred through its investment in equity securities and is
    managed by its Investment Department. MetLife uses derivatives
    to hedge its equity exposure both in certain liability
    guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
    benefit riders and equity securities. These derivatives include
    exchange-traded equity futures, equity index options contracts
    and equity variance swaps. The Company’s derivative hedges
    performed effectively through the extreme movements in the
    equity markets during the latter part of 2008. The Company also
    employs reinsurance to manage these exposures.

Hedging Activities.

MetLife uses derivative
    contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including
    interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, and equity risk.
    Derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic
    basis while considering their impact on accounting results and
    GAAP and Statutory capital. The construction of the
    Company’s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the
    type of risk being hedged. Some hedge programs are asset or
    liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce
    risk related to a group of liabilities or assets. The
    Company’s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as
    follows:

•

Risks Related to Living Benefit Riders —  The Company
    uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk
    associated with variable annuity living benefit riders. These
    hedges include equity and interest rate futures, interest rate
    swaps, currency futures/forwards, equity indexed options and
    interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps.

•

Minimum Interest Rate Guarantees — For certain Company
    liability contracts, the Company provides the contractholder a
    guaranteed minimum interest rate. These contracts include
    certain fixed annuities and other insurance liabilities. The
    Company purchases interest rate floors to reduce risk associated
    with these liability guarantees.

•

Reinvestment Risk in Long Duration Liability
    Contracts — Derivatives are used to hedge interest
    rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts,
    such as long term care. Hedges include zero coupon interest rate
    swaps and swaptions.



•

Foreign Currency Risk — The Company uses currency
    swaps and forwards to hedge foreign currency risk. These hedges
    primarily swap foreign denominated bonds or equity exposures to
    US dollars.

•

General ALM Hedging Strategies — In the ordinary
    course of managing the Company’s asset/liability risks, the
    Company uses interest rate futures, interest rate swaps,
    interest rate caps, interest rate floors and inflation swaps.
    These hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or
    inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or
    related to expected future cash flows.

Risk
    Measurement: Sensitivity Analysis

The Company measures market risk related to its market sensitive
    assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates,
    equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a
    sensitivity analysis. This analysis estimates the potential
    changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in interest rates, equity market
    prices and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company believes
    that a 10% change (increase or decrease) in these market rates
    and prices is reasonably possible in the near-term. In
    performing the analysis summarized below, the Company used
    market rates at December 31, 2008. The sensitivity analysis
    separately calculates each of the Company’s market risk
    exposures (interest rate, equity price and foreign currency
    exchange rate) relating to its trading and non trading assets
    and liabilities. The Company modeled the impact of changes in
    market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its
    market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows:

•

the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures
    resulting from a 10% change (increase or decrease) in interest
    rates;

•

the U.S. dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the
    Company’s foreign currency exposures due to a 10% change
    (increase or decrease) in foreign currency exchange
    rates; and

•

the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a 10%
    change (increase or decrease) in equity market prices.

The sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed
    as predictive of the Company’s future financial
    performance. The Company cannot ensure that its actual losses in
    any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the
    table below. Limitations related to this sensitivity analysis
    include:

•

the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and
    parameters established in creating the related sensitivity
    analysis, including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages;

•

the derivatives that qualify as hedges, the impact on reported
    earnings may be materially different from the change in market
    values;

•

the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and
    liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts; and

•

the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities
    remains unchanged throughout the year.

Accordingly, the Company uses such models as tools and not as
    substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management.
    Based on its analysis of the impact of a 10% change (increase or
    decrease) in market rates and prices, MetLife has determined
    that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the
    estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from
    interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity
    exposures.



The table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair
    value for each market risk exposure of the Company’s market

This quantitative measure of risk has decreased by
    $489 million, or approximately 9%, to $4,699 million
    at December 31, 2008 from $5,188 million at
    December 31, 2007. From December 31, 2007 to
    December 31, 2008 there was a decline in interest rates
    across both the swaps and treasury curves which resulted in a
    decrease in the interest rate risk by $2,860 million. In
    addition, the interest rate risk declined by $755 million
    due to a reduction in the asset base and by $414 million
    due to the completion of the Company’s split-off of its 52%
    ownership in RGA. A change in the method of estimating the fair
    value of liabilities in connection with the adoption of
    SFAS 157 further reduced the interest rate risk by
    $254 million. Partially offsetting the decline was an
    increase in the interest rate risk from the use of derivatives
    employed by the Company by $2,151 million, primarily
    related to financial futures and interest rate swaps. Changes in
    the duration of the Company’s portfolio also attributed
    $1,312 million to partially offset the decline in interest
    rate risk. The inclusion of certain reinsurance recoverables
    within premiums and other receivables also increased the
    interest rate risk by $216 million. The remainder of the
    fluctuation is attributable to numerous immaterial items.

In addition to the analysis above, as part of its asset
    liability management program, the Company also performs an
    analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates,
    including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments.
    At December 31, 2008, a hypothetical instantaneous 10%
    decrease in interest rates applied to the Company’s
    liabilities, insurance and associated asset portfolios would
    reduce the estimated fair value of equity by $962 million.

Estimated fair value presented in the table above represents the
    estimated fair value of all financial instruments within this
    financial statement caption not necessarily those solely subject
    to foreign exchange risk.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk decreased by
    $185 million, or 26%, to $526 million at
    December 31, 2008 from $711 million at
    December 31, 2007. From December 31, 2007 to
    December 31, 2008 a decline in the exchange rate of the
    Euro, British pound, the Mexican and Chilean pesos versus the
    U.S. Dollar resulted in the decline of the foreign currency
    exchange risk on fixed maturity securities by $446 million.
    Partially offsetting the decline in



foreign currency exchange risk was the exclusion of certain
    items due to the completion of the Company’s split-off of
    its 52% ownership in RGA which accounted for $296 million
    reduction to the foreign currency risk. In addition, the foreign
    currency exchange risk associated with long-term debt declined
    by $80 million due the weakening of the British pound
    against the U.S. dollar. The remainder of the fluctuation
    is attributable to numerous immaterial items.

Embedded derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheet in the same caption as the host contract.

Equity price risk increased by $80 million, or 83%, to
    $176 million at December 31, 2008 from
    $96 million at December 31, 2007. The increase was
    primarily attributed to the increased use of equity derivatives
    employed by the Company to hedge its equity exposures,
    particularly the use of financial futures and options. An
    increase in liabilities, particularly variable annuities with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders, during 2008 partially offset
    the increase in equity price risk.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index to Consolidated
    Financial Statements and Schedules. These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
    statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit
    also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedules, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for certain assets and liabilities to a fair value
    measurement approach as required by accounting guidance adopted
    on January 1, 2008, and changed its method of accounting
    for deferred acquisition costs and for income taxes as required
    by accounting guidance adopted on January 1, 2007.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report, dated February 26, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Business,
    Basis of Presentation, and Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). MetLife
    is a leading provider of individual insurance, employee benefits
    and financial services with operations throughout the United
    States and the Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions.
    Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife offers life
    insurance, annuities, auto and home insurance, retail banking
    and other financial services to individuals, as well as group
    insurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions.

Basis
    of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries as well as
    partnerships and joint ventures in which the Company has
    control. Closed block assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses
    outside the closed block based on the nature of the particular
    item. See Note 9. Intercompany accounts and transactions
    have been eliminated.

In addition the Company has invested in certain structured
    transactions that are variable interest entities
    (“VIEs”) under Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”)
    No. 46(r),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities — An Interpretation of Accounting Research
    Bulletin No. 51

(“FIN 46(r)”).
    These structured transactions include reinsurance trusts,
    asset-backed securitizations, trust preferred securities, joint
    ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies.
    The Company is required to consolidate those VIEs for which it
    is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The Company reconsiders
    whether it is the primary beneficiary for investments designated
    as VIEs on a quarterly basis.

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments
    in equity securities in which it has more than a 20% interest
    and for real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership
    interests in which it has more than a minor equity interest or
    more than a minor influence over the joint venture’s or
    partnership’s operations, but does not have a controlling
    interest and is not the primary beneficiary. The Company uses
    the cost method of accounting for investments in real estate
    joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which
    it has a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over
    the joint venture’s or the partnership’s operations.

Minority interest related to consolidated entities included in
    other liabilities was $251 million and $272 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. There was also
    minority interest of $1.5 billion included in liabilities
    of subsidiaries held-for-sale at December 31, 2007.

Certain amounts in the prior year periods’ consolidated
    financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
    2008 presentation. Such reclassifications include
    $61 million and $47 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to the
    effect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash
    balances. These amounts were reclassified from cash flows from
    operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash
    flows for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. See
    also Note 23 for reclassifications related to discontinued
    operations.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“GAAP”) requires management to adopt
    accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that
    affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements. The most critical estimates include those used in
    determining:

(i)

the estimated fair value of investments in the absence of quoted
    market values;

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(ii)

investment impairments;

(iii)

the recognition of income on certain investment entities;

(iv)

the application of the consolidation rules to certain
    investments;

(v)

the existence and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives
    requiring bifurcation;

(vi)

the estimated fair value of and accounting for derivatives;

(vii)

the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy
    acquisition costs (“DAC”) and the establishment and
    amortization of value of business acquired (“VOBA”);

(viii)

the measurement of goodwill and related impairment, if any;

(ix)

the liability for future policyholder benefits;

(x)

accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax
    assets;

(xi)

accounting for reinsurance transactions;

(xii)

accounting for employee benefit plans; and

(xiii)

the liability for litigation and regulatory matters.

A description of such critical estimates is incorporated within
    the discussion of the related accounting policies which follow.
    The application of purchase accounting requires the use of
    estimation techniques in determining the fair values of assets
    acquired and liabilities assumed — the most
    significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical
    estimates. In applying these policies, management makes
    subjective and complex judgments that frequently require
    estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of
    these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in
    the insurance and financial services industries; others are
    specific to the Company’s businesses and operations. Actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

Fair
    Value

As described below, certain assets and liabilities are measured
    at estimated fair value on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheets. In addition, these footnotes to the consolidated
    financial statements include disclosures of estimated fair
    values. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
    No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
    (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157 defines fair value as
    the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
    transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
    advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
    In many cases, the exit price and the transaction (or entry)
    price will be the same at initial recognition. However, in
    certain cases, the transaction price may not represent fair
    value. Under SFAS 157, fair value of a liability is based
    on the amount that would be paid to transfer a liability to a
    third party with the same credit standing. SFAS 157
    requires that fair value be a market-based measurement in which
    the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction
    at the measurement date, considered from the perspective of a
    market participant. When quoted prices are not used to determine
    fair value, SFAS 157 requires consideration of three broad
    valuation techniques: (i) the market approach,
    (ii) the income approach, and (iii) the cost approach.
    The approaches are not new, but SFAS 157 requires that
    entities determine the most appropriate valuation technique to
    use, given what is being measured and the availability of
    sufficient inputs. SFAS 157 prioritizes the inputs to fair
    valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable
    inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available.
    The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities measured
    at estimated fair value into a three-level hierarchy, based on
    the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation
    technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
    to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

or liability’s classification within the fair value
    hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to
    its valuation. SFAS 157 defines the input levels as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities. The Company defines active markets based on
    average trading volume for equity securities. The size of the
    bid/ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for
    fixed maturity securities.

Level 2

Quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are
    observable either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs
    include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other
    than quoted prices in Level 1; quoted prices in markets
    that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can
    be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data for substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the
    assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
    Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial
    instruments whose values are determined using pricing models,
    discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
    well as instruments for which the determination of estimated
    fair value requires significant management judgment or
    estimation.

The measurement and disclosures under SFAS 157 in the
    accompanying financial statements and footnotes exclude certain
    items such as nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
    initially measured at estimated fair value in a business
    combination, reporting units measured at estimated fair value in
    the first step of a goodwill impairment test and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets measured at estimated fair
    value for impairment assessment. The effective date for these
    items was deferred to January 1, 2009.

Prior to adoption of SFAS 157, estimated fair value was
    determined based solely upon the perspective of the reporting
    entity. Therefore, methodologies used to determine the estimated
    fair value of certain financial instruments prior to
    January 1, 2008, while being deemed appropriate under
    existing accounting guidance, may not have produced an exit
    value as defined in SFAS 157.

Investments

The Company’s principal investments are in fixed maturity
    and equity securities, trading securities, mortgage and consumer
    loans, policy loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests, short-term investments, and
    other invested assets. The accounting policies related to each
    are as follows:

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities.

The
    Company’s fixed maturity and equity securities are
    classified as available-for-sale, except for trading securities,
    and are reported at their estimated fair value.

Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are
    recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income
    (loss), net of policyholder related amounts and deferred income
    taxes. All security transactions are recorded on a trade date
    basis. Investment gains and losses on sales of securities are
    determined on a specific identification basis.

Interest income on fixed maturity securities is recorded when
    earned using an effective yield method giving effect to
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividends
    on equity securities are recorded when declared. These dividends
    and interest income are recorded in net investment income.

Included within fixed maturity securities are loan-backed
    securities including mortgage-backed and asset-backed
    securities. Amortization of the premium or discount from the
    purchase of these securities considers the estimated timing and
    amount of prepayments of the underlying loans. Actual prepayment
    experience is periodically reviewed and effective yields are
    recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments
    originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and
    currently anticipated. Prepayment

F-9

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

assumptions for single class and multi-class mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities are estimated by management using inputs
    obtained from third party specialists, including broker-dealers,
    and based on management’s knowledge of the current market.
    For credit-sensitive mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities
    and certain prepayment-sensitive securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a prospective basis. For all other
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, the effective yield
    is recalculated on a retrospective basis.

The cost or amortized cost of fixed maturity and equity
    securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be
    other-than-temporary in the period in which the determination is
    made. These impairments are included within net investment gains
    (losses) and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity
    securities is reduced accordingly. The Company does not change
    the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value.

The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on
    management’s

case-by-case

evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in
    estimated fair value. The Company’s review of its fixed
    maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an
    analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three
    categories of securities: (i) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the
    estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or
    amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and
    (iii) securities where the estimated fair value had
    declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or
    more for six months or greater. An extended and severe
    unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not
    have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all
    scheduled interest and principal payments and the Company’s
    evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows, as
    well as the Company’s ability and intent to hold the
    security, including holding the security until the earlier of a
    recovery in value, or until maturity. In contrast, for certain
    equity securities, greater weight and consideration are given by
    the Company to a decline in market value and the likelihood such
    market value decline will recover. See also Note 3.

Additionally, management considers a wide range of factors about
    the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the
    cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security
    and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent
    in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions
    and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future
    earnings potential. Considerations used by the Company in the
    impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to:
    (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market
    value has been below cost or amortized cost; (ii) the
    potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is
    experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the
    potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or
    sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain
    economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the
    potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series
    of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss
    or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) the Company’s
    ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time
    sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount
    equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost (See also
    Note 3); (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash
    flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and
    (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations
    and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.

In periods subsequent to the recognition of an
    other-than-temporary impairment on a debt security, the Company
    accounts for the impaired security as if it had been purchased
    on the measurement date of the impairment. Accordingly, the
    discount (or reduced premium) based on the new cost basis is
    accreted into net investment income over the remaining term of
    the debt security in a prospective manner based on the amount
    and timing of estimated future cash flows.

The Company purchases and receives beneficial interests in
    special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which enhance the
    Company’s total return on its investment portfolio
    principally by providing equity-based returns on debt
    securities. These investments are generally made through
    structured notes and similar instruments (collectively,
    “Structured Investment Transactions”). The Company has
    not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the
    SPEs and its exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value
    of the beneficial

F-10

    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

interests in the SPEs. The Company does not consolidate such
    SPEs as it has determined it is not the primary beneficiary.
    These Structured Investment Transactions are included in fixed
    maturity securities and their income is generally recognized
    using the retrospective interest method. Impairments of these
    investments are included in net investment gains (losses).

Trading Securities.

The Company’s trading
    securities portfolio, principally consisting of fixed maturity
    and equity securities, supports investment strategies that
    involve the active and frequent purchase and sale of securities
    and the execution of short sale agreements, and supports asset
    and liability matching strategies for certain insurance
    products. Trading securities and short sale agreement
    liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value with subsequent
    changes in estimated fair value recognized in net investment
    income. Related dividends and investment income are also
    included in net investment income.

Securities Lending.

Securities loaned
    transactions, whereby blocks of securities, which are included
    in fixed maturity and equity securities, are loaned to third
    parties, are treated as financing arrangements and the
    associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received.
    The Company generally obtains collateral in an amount equal to
    102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned. The
    Company monitors the estimated fair value of the securities
    loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as
    necessary. Substantially all of the Company’s securities
    loaned transactions are with large brokerage firms and
    commercial banks. Income and expenses associated with securities
    loaned transactions are reported as investment income and
    investment expense, respectively, within net investment income.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans.

Mortgage and
    consumer loans held-for-investment are stated at unpaid
    principal balance, adjusted for any unamortized premium or
    discount, deferred fees or expenses, net of valuation
    allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount
    of the loan based on the loan’s contractual interest rate.
    Amortization of premiums and discounts is recorded using the
    effective yield method. Interest income, amortization of
    premiums and discounts, and prepayment fees are reported in net
    investment income. Loans are considered to be impaired when it
    is probable that, based upon current information and events, the
    Company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the
    contractual terms of the loan agreement. Based on the facts and
    circumstances of the individual loans being impaired, valuation
    allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the
    loan over either (i) the present value of expected future
    cash flows discounted at the loan’s original effective
    interest rate, (ii) the estimated fair value of the
    loan’s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process
    of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent, or
    (iii) the loan’s estimated fair value. The Company
    also establishes allowances for loan losses when a loss
    contingency exists for pools of loans with similar
    characteristics, such as mortgage loans based on similar
    property types or loan to value risk factors. A loss contingency
    exists when the likelihood that a future event will occur is
    probable based on past events. Interest income earned on
    impaired loans is accrued on the principal amount of the loan
    based on the loan’s contractual interest rate. However,
    interest ceases to be accrued for loans on which interest is
    generally more than 60 days past due

and/or

when
    the collection of interest is not considered probable. Cash
    receipts on such impaired loans are recorded as a reduction of
    the recorded investment. Gains and losses from the sale of loans
    and changes in valuation allowances are reported in net
    investment gains (losses).

Mortgage loans held-for-sale primarily include residential
    mortgages which are originated with the intent to sell and for
    which the fair value option was elected. These loans are stated
    at estimated fair value with subsequent changes in estimated
    fair value recognized in other revenue. Certain other mortgage
    loans previously designated as held-for-investment have been
    designated as held-for-sale to reflect a change in the
    Company’s intention as it relates to holding such loans. At
    the time of transfer, such loans are recorded at the lower of
    amortized cost or estimated fair value less expected disposition
    costs determined on an individual loan basis. Amortized cost is
    determined in the same manner as for mortgage loans
    held-for-investment described above. The amount by which
    amortized cost exceeds estimated fair value less expected
    disposition costs is accounted for as a valuation allowance.
    Changes in such valuation allowance are recognized in net
    investment gains (losses).

Policy Loans.

Policy loans are stated at
    unpaid principal balances. Interest income on such loans is
    recorded as earned using the contractually agreed upon interest
    rate. Generally, interest is capitalized on the policy’s
    anniversary date.

Real Estate.

Real estate held-for-investment,
    including related improvements, is stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
    (typically 20 to 55 years). Rental income is recognized on
    a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.
    The Company classifies a property as held-for-sale if it commits
    to a plan to sell a property within one year and actively
    markets the property in its current condition for a price that
    is reasonable in comparison to its estimated fair value. The
    Company classifies the results of operations and the gain or
    loss on sale of a property that either has been disposed of or
    classified as held-for-sale as discontinued operations, if the
    ongoing operations of the property will be eliminated from the
    ongoing operations of the Company and if the Company will not
    have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of
    the property after the sale. Real estate held-for-sale is stated
    at the lower of depreciated cost or estimated fair value less
    expected disposition costs. Real estate is not depreciated while
    it is classified as held-for-sale. The Company periodically
    reviews its properties held-for-investment for impairment and
    tests properties for recoverability whenever events or changes
    in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may
    not be recoverable and the carrying value of the property
    exceeds its estimated fair value. Properties whose carrying
    values are greater than their undiscounted cash flows are
    written down to their estimated fair value, with the impairment
    loss included in net investment gains (losses). Impairment
    losses are based upon the estimated fair value of real estate,
    which is generally computed using the present value of expected
    future cash flows from the real estate discounted at a rate
    commensurate with the underlying risks. Real estate acquired
    upon foreclosure of commercial and agricultural mortgage loans
    is recorded at the lower of estimated fair value or the carrying
    value of the mortgage loan at the date of foreclosure.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests.

The Company uses the equity method of
    accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests consisting of leveraged
    buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds in
    which it has more than a minor equity interest or more than a
    minor influence over the joint ventures or partnership’s
    operations, but does not have a controlling interest and is not
    the primary beneficiary. The Company uses the cost method of
    accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests in which it has a minor
    equity investment and virtually no influence over the joint
    ventures or the partnership’s operations. The Company
    reports the distributions from real estate joint ventures and
    other limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost
    method and equity in earnings from real estate joint ventures
    and other limited partnership interests accounted for under the
    equity method in net investment income. In addition to the
    investees performing regular evaluations for the impairment of
    underlying investments, the Company routinely evaluates its
    investments in real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnerships for impairments. The Company considers its cost
    method investments for other-than-temporary impairment when the
    carrying value of real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnership interests exceeds the net asset value. The Company
    takes into consideration the severity and duration of this
    excess when deciding if the cost method investment is
    other-than-temporarily impaired. For equity method investees,
    the Company considers financial and other information provided
    by the investee, other known information and inherent risks in
    the underlying investments, as well as future capital
    commitments, in determining whether an impairment has occurred.
    When an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have
    occurred, the Company records a realized capital loss within net
    investment gains (losses) to record the investment at its
    estimated fair value.

Short-term Investments.

Short-term investments
    include investments with remaining maturities of one year or
    less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition
    and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated
    fair value, or stated at estimated fair value, if available.

Other Invested Assets.

Other invested assets
    consist principally of freestanding derivatives with positive
    estimated fair values, leveraged leases, joint venture
    investments, tax credit partnerships, funding agreements,
    mortgage servicing rights, and funds withheld at interest.

Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values are
    more fully described in the derivatives accounting policy which
    follows.

Leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse debt. The
    Company participates in lease transactions which are diversified
    by industry, asset type and geographic area. The Company
    recognizes income on the leveraged leases by applying the
    leveraged lease’s estimated rate of return to the net
    investment in the lease. The Company regularly reviews residual
    values and impairs them to expected values as needed.

Joint venture investments represent the Company’s
    investments in entities that engage in insurance underwriting
    activities and are accounted for on the equity method. Tax
    credit partnerships are established for the purpose of investing
    in low-income housing and other social causes, where the primary
    return on investment is in the form of tax credits and are also
    accounted for on equity method. The Company reports the equity
    in earnings of joint venture investments and tax credit
    partnerships in net investment income.

Funding agreements represent arrangements where the Company has
    long-term interest bearing amounts on deposit with third parties
    and are generally stated at amortized cost.

Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are measured at
    estimated fair value and are either acquired or are generated
    from the sale of originated residential mortgage loans where the
    servicing rights are retained by the Company. Changes in
    estimated fair value of MSRs are reported in other revenues in
    the period in which the change occurs.

Funds withheld represent amounts contractually withheld by
    ceding companies in accordance with reinsurance agreements. The
    Company records a funds withheld receivable rather than the
    underlying investments. The Company recognizes interest on funds
    withheld at rates defined by the terms of the agreement which
    may be contractually specified or directly related to the
    investment portfolio and records it in net investment income.

Estimates and Uncertainties.

The
    Company’s investments are exposed to four primary sources
    of risk: credit, interest rate, liquidity risk, and market
    valuation. The financial statement risks, stemming from such
    investment risks, are those associated with the determination of
    estimated fair values, the diminished ability to sell certain
    investments in times of strained market conditions, the
    recognition of impairments, the recognition of income on certain
    investments, and the potential consolidation of VIEs. The use of
    different methodologies, assumptions and inputs relating to
    these financial statement risks may have a material effect on
    the amounts presented within the consolidated financial
    statements.

When available, the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted prices
    in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable.
    Generally, these are the most liquid of the Company’s
    securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not
    involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard
    valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to:
    interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or counterparty,
    industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions,
    sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated duration and
    management’s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated
    future cash flows. Accordingly, the estimated fair values are
    based on available market information and management’s
    judgments about financial instruments.

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans
    held-for-sale are determined based on observable pricing of
    residential mortgage loans held-for-sale with similar
    characteristics, or observable pricing for securities backed by
    similar types of loans, adjusted to convert the securities
    prices to loan prices. Generally, quoted market prices are not
    available. When observable pricing for similar loans or
    securities that are backed by similar loans are not available,
    the estimated fair values of residential mortgage loans
    held-for-sale are determined using independent broker
    quotations, which is intended to approximate the amounts that
    would be received from third parties. Certain other mortgages
    have also been designated as held-for-sale which are recorded at
    the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value less
    expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan
    basis. For these loans, estimated fair value is determined using
    independent broker quotations or, when the loan is in
    foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral dependent,
    the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral estimated
    using internal models.

The estimated fair value of MSRs is principally determined
    through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which
    utilize various assumptions as to discount rates,
    loan-prepayments, and servicing costs. The use of different
    valuation assumptions and inputs as well as assumptions relating
    to the collection of expected cash flows may have a material
    effect on MSRs estimated fair values.

Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by
    rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in
    asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities,
    or the price ultimately realized for these securities, depends
    upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the
    use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of
    certain securities.

The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments,
    as applicable, is described previously by investment type. The
    determination of such allowances and impairments is highly
    subjective and is based upon the Company’s periodic
    evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated
    with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and
    assessments are revised as conditions change and new information
    becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly
    and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations
    as such evaluations are revised.

The recognition of income on certain investments (e.g.
    loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed and
    asset-backed securities, certain structured investment
    transactions, trading securities, etc.) is dependent upon market
    conditions, which could result in prepayments and changes in
    amounts to be earned.

The accounting rules under FIN 46(r) for the determination
    of when an entity is a VIE and when to consolidate a VIE are
    complex. The determination of the VIE’s primary beneficiary
    requires an evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations
    associated with each party involved in the entity, an estimate
    of the entity’s expected losses and expected residual
    returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party
    involved in the entity. FIN 46(r) defines the primary
    beneficiary as the entity that will absorb a majority of a

F-14

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority of a VIE’s
    expected residual returns if no single entity absorbs a majority
    of expected losses, or both.

When determining the primary beneficiary for structured
    investment products such as asset-backed securitizations and
    collateralized debt obligations, the Company uses historical
    default probabilities based on the credit rating of each issuer
    and other inputs including maturity dates, industry
    classifications and geographic location. Using computational
    algorithms, the analysis simulates default scenarios resulting
    in a range of expected losses and the probability associated
    with each occurrence. For other investment structures such as
    trust preferred securities, joint ventures, limited partnerships
    and limited liability companies, the Company gains an
    understanding of the design of the VIE and generally uses a
    qualitative approach to determine if it is the primary
    beneficiary. This approach includes an analysis of all
    contractual rights and obligations held by all parties including
    profit and loss allocations, repayment or residual value
    guarantees, put and call options and other derivative
    instruments. If the primary beneficiary of a VIE can not be
    identified using this qualitative approach, the Company
    calculates the expected losses and expected residual returns of
    the VIE using a probability-weighted cash flow model. The use of
    different methodologies, assumptions and inputs in the
    determination of the primary beneficiary could have a material
    effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived
    from interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or other
    financial indices. Derivatives may be exchange-traded or
    contracted in the over-the-counter market. The Company uses a
    variety of derivatives, including swaps, forwards, futures and
    option contracts, to manage the risk associated with variability
    in cash flows or changes in estimated fair values related to the
    Company’s financial instruments. The Company also uses
    derivative instruments to hedge its currency exposure associated
    with net investments in certain foreign operations. To a lesser
    extent, the Company uses credit derivatives, such as credit
    default swaps, to synthetically replicate investment risks and
    returns which are not readily available in the cash market. The
    Company also purchases certain securities, issues certain
    insurance policies and investment contracts and engages in
    certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives.

Freestanding derivatives are carried on the Company’s
    consolidated balance sheet either as assets within other
    invested assets or as liabilities within other liabilities at
    estimated fair value as determined through the use of quoted
    market prices for exchange-traded derivatives and financial
    forwards to sell residential mortgage backed securities or
    through the use of pricing models for over-the-counter
    derivatives. The determination of estimated fair value, when
    quoted market values are not available, is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies and inputs that are assumed to
    be consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing the instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected
    by changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
    financial indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The significant inputs to the pricing models for most
    over-the-counter derivatives are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Significant inputs that are observable
    generally include: interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates, interest rate curves, credit curves and volatility.
    However, certain over-the-counter derivatives may rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. Significant inputs
    that are unobservable generally include: independent broker
    quotes, credit correlation assumptions, references to emerging
    market currencies and inputs that are outside the observable
    portion of the interest rate curve, credit curve, volatility or
    other relevant market measure. These unobservable inputs may
    involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even
    though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions
    deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments. Most inputs for over-the-counter derivatives are
    mid

F-15


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

market inputs but, in certain cases, bid level inputs are used
    when they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market
    liquidity as well as the use of different methodologies,
    assumptions and inputs may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and
    could materially affect net income.

The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are
    considered in determining the estimated fair value for all
    over-the-counter derivatives after taking into account the
    effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements.
    Credit risk is monitored and consideration of any potential
    credit adjustment is based on a net exposure by counterparty.
    This is due to the existence of netting agreements and
    collateral arrangements which effectively serve to mitigate
    credit risk. The Company values its derivative positions using
    the standard swap curve which includes a credit risk adjustment.
    This credit risk adjustment is appropriate for those parties
    that execute trades at pricing levels consistent with the
    standard swap curve. As the Company and its significant
    derivative counterparties consistently execute trades at such
    pricing levels, additional credit risk adjustments are not
    currently required in the valuation process. The need for such
    additional credit risk adjustments is monitored by the Company.
    The Company’s ability to consistently execute at such
    pricing levels is in part due to the netting agreements and
    collateral arrangements that are in place with all of its
    significant derivative counterparties. The evaluation of the
    requirement to make an additional credit risk adjustments is
    performed by the Company each reporting period.

If a derivative is not designated as an accounting hedge or its
    use in managing risk does not qualify for hedge accounting,
    changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative are
    generally reported in net investment gains (losses) except for
    those (i) in policyholder benefits and claims for economic
    hedges of liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity
    products offered by the Company, (ii) in net investment
    income for economic hedges of equity method investments in joint
    ventures, or for all derivatives held in relation to the trading
    portfolios and (iii) in other revenues for derivatives held
    in connection with the Company’s mortgage banking
    activities. The fluctuations in estimated fair value of
    derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting
    can result in significant volatility in net income.

To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging
    relationship, the Company formally documents its risk management
    objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction,
    as well as its designation of the hedge as either (i) a
    hedge of the estimated fair value of a recognized asset or
    liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value
    hedge”); (ii) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or
    of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related
    to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow
    hedge”); or (iii) a hedge of a net investment in a
    foreign operation. In this documentation, the Company sets forth
    how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated
    risks related to the hedged item and sets forth the method that
    will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the
    hedging instrument’s effectiveness and the method which
    will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated
    as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly
    effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item.
    Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and
    periodically throughout the life of the designated hedging
    relationship. Assessments of hedge effectiveness and
    measurements of ineffectiveness are also subject to
    interpretation and estimation and different interpretations or
    estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in
    net income.

The accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of
    the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice.
    Judgment is applied in determining the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment under these accounting standards. If it was
    determined that hedge accounting designations were not
    appropriately applied, reported net income could be materially
    affected. Differences in judgment as to the availability and
    application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate
    accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the
    consolidated financial statements of the Company from that
    previously reported.

Under a fair value hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative, including amounts measured as
    ineffectiveness, and changes in the estimated fair value of the
    hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged, are
    reported within net investment gains (losses). The estimated
    fair values of the hedging derivatives are exclusive of any
    accruals that are separately reported in the consolidated
    statement of income within interest

F-16


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

income or interest expense to match the location of the hedged
    item. However, balances that are not scheduled to settle until
    maturity are included in the estimated fair value of derivatives.

Under a cash flow hedge, changes in the estimated fair value of
    the hedging derivative measured as effective are reported within
    other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of
    stockholders’ equity, and the deferred gains or losses on
    the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statement
    of income when the Company’s earnings are affected by the
    variability in cash flows of the hedged item. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net investment gains
    (losses). The estimated fair values of the hedging derivatives
    are exclusive of any accruals that are separately reported in
    the consolidated statement of income within interest income or
    interest expense to match the location of the hedged item.
    However, balances that are not scheduled to settle until
    maturity are included in the estimated fair value of derivatives.

In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, changes
    in the estimated fair value of the hedging derivative that are
    measured as effective are reported within other comprehensive
    income (loss) consistent with the translation adjustment for the
    hedged net investment in the foreign operation. Changes in the
    estimated fair value of the hedging instrument measured as
    ineffectiveness are reported within net investment gains
    (losses).

The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when:
    (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer
    highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated fair
    value or cash flows of a hedged item; (ii) the derivative
    expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no
    longer probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will
    occur; (iv) a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the
    definition of a firm commitment; or (v) the derivative is
    de-designated as a hedging instrument.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined
    that the derivative is not highly effective in offsetting
    changes in the estimate fair value or cash flows of a hedged
    item, the derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated
    balance sheet at its estimated fair value, with changes in
    estimated fair value recognized currently in net investment
    gains (losses). The carrying value of the hedged recognized
    asset or liability under a fair value hedge is no longer
    adjusted for changes in its estimated fair value due to the
    hedged risk, and the cumulative adjustment to its carrying value
    is amortized into income over the remaining life of the hedged
    item. Provided the hedged forecasted transaction is still
    probable of occurrence, the changes in estimated fair value of
    derivatives recorded in other comprehensive income (loss)
    related to discontinued cash flow hedges are released into the
    consolidated statement of income when the Company’s
    earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the
    hedged item.

When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is no longer
    probable that the forecasted transactions will occur by the end
    of the specified time period or the hedged item no longer meets
    the definition of a firm commitment, the derivative continues to
    be carried on the consolidated balance sheet at its estimated
    fair value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized
    currently in net investment gains (losses). Any asset or
    liability associated with a recognized firm commitment is
    derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet, and recorded
    currently in net investment gains (losses). Deferred gains and
    losses of a derivative recorded in other comprehensive income
    (loss) pursuant to the cash flow hedge of a forecasted
    transaction are recognized immediately in net investment gains
    (losses).

In all other situations in which hedge accounting is
    discontinued, the derivative is carried at its estimated fair
    value on the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in its
    estimated fair value recognized in the current period as net
    investment gains (losses).

The Company is also a party to financial instruments that
    contain terms which are deemed to be embedded derivatives. The
    Company assesses each identified embedded derivative to
    determine whether it is required to be bifurcated. If the
    instrument would not be accounted for in its entirety at
    estimated fair value and it is determined that the terms of the
    embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the
    economic characteristics of the host contract, and that a
    separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a
    derivative instrument, the

F-17


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and
    accounted for as a freestanding derivative. Such embedded
    derivatives are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at
    estimated fair value with the host contract and changes in their
    estimated fair value are reported currently in net investment
    gains (losses) or in policyholder benefits and claims. If the
    Company is unable to properly identify and measure an embedded
    derivative for separation from its host contract, the entire
    contract is carried on the balance sheet at estimated fair
    value, with changes in estimated fair value recognized in the
    current period in net investment gains (losses) or in
    policyholder benefits and claims. Additionally, the Company may
    elect to carry an entire contract on the balance sheet at
    estimated fair value, with changes in estimated fair value
    recognized in the current period in net investment gains
    (losses) or in policyholder benefits and claims if that contract
    contains an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation. There
    is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation may
    not be identified and reported at estimated fair value in the
    consolidated financial statements and that their related changes
    in estimated fair value could materially affect reported net
    income.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased
    with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less
    at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Property,
    Equipment, Leasehold Improvements and Computer
    Software

Property, equipment and leasehold improvements, which are
    included in other assets, are stated at cost, less accumulated
    depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is determined using
    either the straight-line or sum-of-the-years-digits method over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets, as appropriate. The
    estimated life for company occupied real estate property is
    generally 40 years. Estimated lives generally range from
    five to ten years for leasehold improvements and three to seven
    years for all other property and equipment. The cost basis of
    the property, equipment and leasehold improvements was
    $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Accumulated depreciation and
    amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements
    was $926 million and $810 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Related depreciation and
    amortization expense was $150 million, $132 million
    and $125 million for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Computer software, which is included in other assets, is stated
    at cost, less accumulated amortization. Purchased software
    costs, as well as certain internal and external costs incurred
    to develop internal-use computer software during the application
    development stage, are capitalized. Such costs are amortized
    generally over a four-year period using the straight-line
    method. The cost basis of computer software was
    $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Accumulated amortization of
    capitalized software was $1,002 million and
    $858 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Related amortization expense was
    $153 million, $121 million and $109 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Deferred
    Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business
    Acquired

The Company incurs significant costs in connection with
    acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that vary
    with and relate to the production of new business are deferred
    as DAC. Such costs consist principally of commissions and agency
    and policy issuance expenses. VOBA is an intangible asset that
    reflects the estimated fair value of in-force contracts in a
    life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of
    the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right
    to receive future cash flows from the business in-force at the
    acquisition date. VOBA is based on actuarially determined
    projections, by each block of business, of future policy and
    contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate
    account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment
    returns and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased
    business may vary from these projections. The recovery of DAC
    and VOBA is dependent upon the future profitability of the
    related business. DAC and VOBA are aggregated in the financial
    statements for reporting purposes.

F-18

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

DAC for property and casualty insurance contracts, which is
    primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting
    expenses, is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term or reinsurance treaty.

DAC and VOBA on life insurance or investment-type contracts are
    amortized in proportion to gross premiums, gross margins or
    gross profits, depending on the type of contract as described
    below.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to non-participating
    and non-dividend-paying traditional contracts (term insurance,
    non-participating whole life insurance, non-medical health
    insurance, and traditional group life insurance) over the entire
    premium paying period in proportion to the present value of
    actual historic and expected future gross premiums. The present
    value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement
    of each policy and assumptions for mortality, morbidity,
    persistency, and investment returns at policy issuance, or
    policy acquisition, as it relates to VOBA, that include
    provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the
    assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit
    liabilities. These assumptions are not revised after policy
    issuance or acquisition unless the DAC or VOBA balance is deemed
    to be unrecoverable from future expected profits. Absent a
    premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy
    issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium
    volumes.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to participating,
    dividend-paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives
    of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future
    gross margins. The amortization includes interest based on rates
    in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts. The
    future gross margins are dependent principally on investment
    returns, policyholder dividend scales, mortality, persistency,
    expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of
    reinsurance counterparties, and certain economic variables, such
    as inflation. For participating contracts (dividend paying
    traditional contracts within the closed block) future gross
    margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder
    dividend obligation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates
    that investment returns, expenses, persistency, and other factor
    changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely
    to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA amortization.
    Each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated gross
    margins with the actual gross margins for that period. When the
    actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross
    margins, the cumulative DAC and VOBA amortization is re-
    estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to
    current operations. When actual gross margins exceed those
    previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below
    the previously estimated gross margins. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business in-force,
    which impacts expected future gross margins. When expected
    future gross margins are below those previously estimated, the
    DAC and VOBA amortization will increase, resulting in a current
    period charge to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    expected future gross margins are above the previously estimated
    expected future gross margins. Total DAC and VOBA amortization
    during a particular period may increase or decrease depending
    upon the relative size of the amortization change resulting from
    the adjustment to DAC and VOBA for the update of actual gross
    margins and the re-estimation of expected future gross margins.
    Each period, the Company also reviews the estimated gross
    margins for each block of business to determine the
    recoverability of DAC and VOBA balances.

The Company amortizes DAC and VOBA related to fixed and variable
    universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity
    contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in
    proportion to actual and expected future gross profits. The
    amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at
    inception or acquisition of the contracts. The amount of future
    gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of
    the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, persistency,
    interest crediting rates, expenses to administer the business,
    creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties, the effect of
    any hedges used, and certain economic variables, such as
    inflation. Of these factors, the Company anticipates that
    investment returns, expenses, and persistency are reasonably
    likely to impact significantly the rate of DAC and VOBA
    amortization. Each reporting period, the Company updates the
    estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that
    period. When the actual gross profits change from previously
    estimated gross profits, the cumulative DAC and VOBA
    amortization is re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge
    or credit to current operations. When actual gross profits
    exceed those

F-19


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

previously estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will
    increase, resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The
    opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below
    the previously estimated gross profits. Each reporting period,
    the Company also updates the actual amount of business remaining
    in-force, which impacts expected future gross profits. When
    expected future gross profits are below those previously
    estimated, the DAC and VOBA amortization will increase,
    resulting in a current period charge to earnings. The opposite
    result occurs when the expected future gross profits are above
    the previously estimated expected future gross profits. Total
    DAC and VOBA amortization during a particular period may
    increase or decrease depending upon the relative size of the
    amortization change resulting from the adjustment to DAC and
    VOBA for the update of actual gross profits and the
    re-estimation of expected future gross profits. Each period, the
    Company also reviews the estimated gross profits for each block
    of business to determine the recoverability of DAC and VOBA
    balances.

Separate account rates of return on variable universal life
    contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect
    in-force account balances on such contracts each reporting
    period which can result in significant fluctuations in
    amortization of DAC and VOBA. Returns that are higher than the
    Company’s long-term expectation produce higher account
    balances, which increases the Company’s future fee
    expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations
    on minimum death and living benefit guarantees, resulting in
    higher expected future gross profits. The opposite result occurs
    when returns are lower than the Company’s long-term
    expectation. The Company’s practice to determine the impact
    of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts
    assumes that long-term appreciation in equity markets is not
    changed by short-term market fluctuations, but is only changed
    when sustained interim deviations are expected. The Company
    monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its
    long-term expectation changes.

The Company also reviews periodically other long-term
    assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross
    margins and profits. These include investment returns,
    policyholder dividend scales, interest crediting rates,
    mortality, persistency, and expenses to administer business.
    Management annually updates assumptions used in the calculation
    of estimated gross margins and profits which may have
    significantly changed. If the update of assumptions causes
    expected future gross margins and profits to increase, DAC and
    VOBA amortization will decrease, resulting in a current period
    increase to earnings. The opposite result occurs when the
    assumption update causes expected future gross margins and
    profits to decrease.

Prior to 2007, DAC related to any internally replaced contract
    was generally expensed at the date of replacement. As described
    more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements,” effective January 1, 2007, the
    Company adopted Statement of Position (“SOP”)

05-1,

Accounting by Insurance Enterprises for Deferred Acquisition
    Costs in Connection with Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
    Contracts

(“SOP 05-1”).

Under

SOP 05-1,

an internal replacement is defined as a modification in product
    benefits, features, rights or coverages that occur by the
    exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment,
    endorsement, or rider to a contract, or by election or coverage
    within a contract. If the modification substantially changes the
    contract, the DAC is written off immediately through income and
    any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement
    contract are deferred. If the modification does not
    substantially change the contract, the DAC amortization on the
    original contract will continue and any acquisition costs
    associated with the related modification are expensed.

Sales
    Inducements

The Company has two different types of sales inducements which
    are included in other assets: (i) the policyholder receives
    a bonus whereby the policyholder’s initial account balance
    is increased by an amount equal to a specified percentage of the
    customer’s deposit; and (ii) the policyholder receives
    a higher interest rate using a dollar cost averaging method than
    would have been received based on the normal general account
    interest rate credited. The Company defers sales inducements and
    amortizes them over the life of the policy using the same
    methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. The
    amortization of sales inducements is included in interest
    credited to policyholder account balances. Each year the Company
    reviews the deferred sales inducements to determine the
    recoverability of these balances.

    Acquired

Value of distribution agreements (“VODA”) is reported
    in other assets and represents the present value of future
    profits associated with the expected future business derived
    from the distribution agreements. Value of customer
    relationships acquired (“VOCRA”) is also reported in
    other assets and represents the present value of the expected
    future profits associated with the expected future business
    acquired through existing customers of the acquired company or
    business. The VODA and VOCRA associated with past acquisitions
    are amortized over useful life ranging from 10 to 30 years
    and such amortization is included in other expenses. Each year
    the Company reviews VODA and VOCRA to determine the
    recoverability of these balances.

Goodwill

Goodwill is the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of
    net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for
    impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate,
    indicate that there may be justification for conducting an
    interim test. The Company performs its annual goodwill
    impairment testing during the third quarter of each year based
    upon data as of the close of the second quarter.

Impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach,
    which requires the use of estimates and judgment, at the
    “reporting unit” level. A reporting unit is the
    operating segment or a business one level below the operating
    segment, if discrete financial information is prepared and
    regularly reviewed by management at that level. For purposes of
    goodwill impairment testing, a significant portion of goodwill
    within Corporate & Other is allocated to reporting
    units within the Company’s business segments.

For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying
    value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its estimated
    fair value, there is an indication of impairment and the implied
    fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as
    the amount of goodwill would be determined in a business
    acquisition. The excess of the carrying value of goodwill over
    the implied fair value of goodwill is recognized as an
    impairment and recorded as a charge against net income.

In performing its goodwill impairment tests, when management
    believes meaningful comparable market data are available, the
    estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined
    using a market multiple approach. When relevant comparables are
    not available, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model.
    For reporting units which are particularly sensitive to market
    assumptions, such as the annuities and variable &
    universal life reporting units within the Individual segment,
    the Company may corroborate its estimated fair values by using
    additional valuation methodologies.

The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in
    determining estimated fair value include projected earnings,
    current book value (with and without accumulated other
    comprehensive income), the level of economic capital required to
    support the mix of business, long term growth rates, comparative
    market multiples, the account value of in-force business,
    projections of new and renewal business as well as margins on
    such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads,
    equity market levels and the discount rate management believes
    appropriate to the risk associated with the respective reporting
    unit. The estimated fair value of the annuity and
    variable & universal life reporting units are
    particularly sensitive to the equity market levels.

When testing goodwill for impairment, management also considers
    the Company’s market capitalization in relation to its book
    value. Management believes that the overall decrease in the
    Company’s current market capitalization is not
    representative of a long-term decrease in the value of the
    underlying reporting units.

Management applies significant judgment when determining the
    estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units and
    when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the
    estimated fair value of its reporting units and their book
    value. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key
    judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change.
    Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent
    only

management’s reasonable expectation regarding future
    developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions
    upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood,
    differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in
    the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units
    could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which
    could materially adversely affect the Company’s results of
    operations or financial position.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Continued deteriorating or adverse market conditions for
    certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the
    estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result
    in future impairments of goodwill.

See Note 6 for further consideration of goodwill impairment
    testing during 2008.

Liability
    for Future Policy Benefits and Policyholder Account
    Balances

The Company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under
    insurance policies, including traditional life insurance,
    traditional annuities and non-medical health insurance.
    Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time
    and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of
    future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value
    of future expected premiums. Such liabilities are established
    based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with
    GAAP and applicable actuarial standards. Principal assumptions
    used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy
    benefits are mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, renewal,
    retirement, disability incidence, disability terminations,
    investment returns, inflation, expenses and other contingent
    events as appropriate to the respective product type. Utilizing
    these assumptions, liabilities are established on a block of
    business basis.

Future policy benefit liabilities for participating traditional
    life insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of
    (i) net level premium reserves for death and endowment
    policy benefits (calculated based upon the non-forfeiture
    interest rate, ranging from 3% to 7% for domestic business and
    3% to 10% for international business, and mortality rates
    guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in
    such contracts); and (ii) the liability for terminal
    dividends.

Future policy benefits for non-participating traditional life
    insurance policies are equal to the aggregate of the present
    value of expected future benefit payments and related expenses
    less the present value of expected future net premiums.
    Assumptions as to mortality and persistency are based upon the
    Company’s experience when the basis of the liability is
    established. Interest rates assumptions for the aggregate future
    policy benefit liabilities range from 2% to 8% for domestic
    business and 2% to 12% for international business.

Participating business represented approximately 8% and 9% of
    the Company’s life insurance in-force, and 14% and 14% of
    the number of life insurance policies in-force, at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Participating
    policies represented approximately 27% and 27%, 31% and 30%, and
    30% and 29% of gross and net life insurance premiums for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    The percentages indicated are calculated excluding the business
    of the reinsurance segment.

Future policy benefit liabilities for individual and group
    traditional fixed annuities after annuitization are equal to the
    present value of expected future payments. Interest rates
    assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 2%
    to 11% for domestic business and 4% to 10% for international
    business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for non-medical health
    insurance are calculated using the net level premium method and
    assumptions as to future morbidity, withdrawals and interest,
    which provide a margin for adverse deviation. Interest rates
    assumptions used in establishing such liabilities range from 4%
    to 7% for domestic business and 2% to 10% for international
    business.

Future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are
    estimated using the present value of benefits method and
    experience assumptions as to claim terminations, expenses and
    interest. Interest rates assumptions used in establishing such
    liabilities range from 3% to 8% for domestic business and 2% to
    10% for international business.

Liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property
    and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder
    benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have
    been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not
    reported. Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon
    the Company’s historical experience and other actuarial
    assumptions that consider the effects of current developments,
    anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for
    anticipated salvage and subrogation. The effects of changes in
    such estimated liabilities are included in the results of
    operations in the period in which the changes occur.

The Company establishes future policy benefit liabilities for
    minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain
    annuity contracts and secondary and

paid-up

guarantees relating to certain life policies as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum death benefit (“GMDB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of death
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance and
    recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period
    based on total expected assessments. The Company regularly
    evaluates estimates used and adjusts the additional liability
    balance, with a related charge or credit to benefit expense, if
    actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier
    assumptions should be revised. The assumptions used in
    estimating the GMDB liabilities are consistent with those used
    for amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability
    and risk. The assumptions of investment performance and
    volatility are consistent with the historical experience of the
    Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500
    Index. The benefit assumptions used in calculating the
    liabilities are based on the average benefits payable over a
    range of scenarios.

•

Guaranteed minimum income benefit (“GMIB”) liabilities
    are determined by estimating the expected value of the income
    benefits in excess of the projected account balance at any
    future date of annuitization and recognizing the excess ratably
    over the accumulation period based on total expected
    assessments. The Company regularly evaluates estimates used and
    adjusts the additional liability balance, with a related charge
    or credit to benefit expense, if actual experience or other
    evidence suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised.
    The assumptions used for estimating the GMIB liabilities are
    consistent with those used for estimating the GMDB liabilities.
    In addition, the calculation of guaranteed annuitization benefit
    liabilities incorporates an assumption for the percentage of the
    potential annuitizations that may be elected by the
    contractholder. Certain GMIBs have settlement features that
    result in a portion of that guarantee being accounted for as an
    embedded derivative and are recorded in policyholder account
    balances as described below.

Liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees
    and

paid-up

guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of
    death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to
    be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the
    accumulation period based on total expected assessments. The
    Company regularly evaluates estimates used and adjusts the
    additional liability balances, with a related charge or credit
    to benefit expense, if actual experience or other evidence
    suggests that earlier assumptions should be revised. The
    assumptions used in estimating the secondary and

paid-up

guarantee liabilities are consistent with those used for
    amortizing DAC, and are thus subject to the same variability and
    risk. The assumptions of investment performance and volatility
    for variable products are consistent with historical S&P
    experience. The benefits used in calculating the liabilities are
    based on the average benefits payable over a range of scenarios.

The Company establishes policyholder account balances for
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders relating to certain variable
    annuity products as follows:

•

Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit riders (“GMWB”)
    guarantee the contractholder a return of their purchase payment
    via partial withdrawals, even if the account value is reduced to
    zero, provided that the contractholder’s cumulative
    withdrawals in a contract year do not exceed a certain limit.
    The initial guaranteed withdrawal amount is equal to the initial
    benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the initial
    purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The GMWB is an
    embedded derivative, which is measured at estimated fair value
    separately from the host variable annuity product.

F-23


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

•

Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit riders
    (“GMAB”) provide the contractholder, after a specified
    period of time determined at the time of issuance of the
    variable annuity contract, with a minimum accumulation of their
    purchase payments even if the account value is reduced to zero.
    The initial guaranteed accumulation amount is equal to the
    initial benefit base as defined in the contract (typically, the
    initial purchase payments plus applicable bonus amounts). The
    GMAB is an embedded derivative, which is measured at estimated
    fair value separately from the host variable annuity product.

For GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB, the initial benefit base is
    increased by additional purchase payments made within a certain
    time period and decreases by benefits paid

and/or

withdrawal amounts. After a specified period of time, the
    benefit base may also increase as a result of an optional reset
    as defined in the contract.

At the inception, the GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB are accounted
    for as embedded derivatives with changes in estimated fair value
    reported in net investment gains (losses).

The Company attributes to the embedded derivative a portion of
    the expected future rider fees to be collected from the
    policyholder equal to the present value of expected future
    guaranteed benefits. Any additional fees represent
    “excess” fees and are reported in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The fair value for these riders is estimated using the present
    value of future benefits minus the present value of future fees
    using actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the
    projected cash flows over the expected lives of the contracts.
    The projections of future benefits and future fees require
    capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations
    concerning policyholder behavior. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the riders
    are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using
    observable risk free rates. Beginning in 2008, the valuation of
    these embedded derivatives now includes an adjustment for the
    Company’s own credit and risk margins for non-capital
    market inputs. The Company’s own credit adjustment is
    determined taking into consideration publicly available
    information relating to the Company’s debt as well as its
    claims paying ability. Risk margins are established to capture
    the non-capital market risks of the instrument which represent
    the additional compensation a market participant would require
    to assume the risks related to the uncertainties of such
    actuarial assumptions as annuitization, premium persistency,
    partial withdrawal and surrenders. The establishment of risk
    margins requires the use of significant management judgment.

These riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or
    declining equity markets. Market conditions including, but not
    limited to, changes in interest rates, equity indices, market
    volatility and foreign currency exchange rates; changes in the
    Company’s own credit standing; and variations in actuarial
    assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, and risk margins
    related to non-capital market inputs may result in significant
    fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the riders that
    could materially affect net income.

The Company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial
    liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with
    its actual experience. Differences between actual experience and
    the assumptions used in pricing these policies, guarantees and
    riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities
    result in variances in profit and could result in losses. The
    effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in
    the results of operations in the period in which the changes
    occur.

Policyholder account balances relate to investment-type
    contracts, universal life-type policies and certain guaranteed
    minimum benefit riders. Investment-type contracts principally
    include traditional individual fixed annuities in the
    accumulation phase and, non-variable group annuity contracts.
    Policyholder account balances for these contracts are equal to
    (i) policy account values, which consist of an accumulation
    of gross premium payments; (ii) credited interest, ranging
    from 1% to 17% for domestic business and 1% to 15% for
    international business, less expenses, mortality charges, and
    withdrawals; and (iii) fair value adjustments relating to
    business combinations. Bank deposits related to the
    Company’s banking operations are also included in
    policyholder account balances.

Other
    Policyholder Funds

Other policyholder funds include policy and contract claims,
    unearned revenue liabilities, premiums received in advance,
    policyholder dividends due and unpaid, and policyholder
    dividends left on deposit.

The liability for policy and contract claims generally relates
    to incurred but not reported death, disability, long-term care
    and dental claims, as well as claims which have been reported
    but not yet settled. The liability for these claims is based on
    the Company’s estimated ultimate cost of settling all
    claims. The Company derives estimates for the development of
    incurred but not reported claims principally from actuarial
    analyses of historical patterns of claims and claims development
    for each line of business. The methods used to determine these
    estimates are continually reviewed. Adjustments resulting from
    this continuous review process and differences between estimates
    and payments for claims are recognized in policyholder benefits
    and claims expense in the period in which the estimates are
    changed or payments are made.

The unearned revenue liability relates to universal life-type
    and investment-type products and represents policy charges for
    services to be provided in future periods. The charges are
    deferred as unearned revenue and amortized using the
    product’s estimated gross profits and margins, similar to
    DAC. Such amortization is recorded in universal life and
    investment-type product policy fees.

The Company accounts for the prepayment of premiums on its
    individual life, group life and health contracts as premium
    received in advance and applies the cash received to premiums
    when due.

Also included in other policyholder funds are policyholder
    dividends due and unpaid on participating policies and
    policyholder dividends left on deposit. Such liabilities are
    presented at amounts contractually due to policyholders.

Recognition
    of Insurance Revenue and Related Benefits

Premiums related to traditional life and annuity policies with
    life contingencies are recognized as revenues when due from
    policyholders. Policyholder benefits and expenses are provided
    against such revenues to recognize profits over the estimated
    lives of the policies. When premiums are due over a
    significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits
    are provided, any excess profit is deferred and recognized into
    operations in a constant relationship to insurance in-force or,
    for annuities, the amount of expected future policy benefit
    payments.

Premiums related to non-medical health and disability contracts
    are recognized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract
    term.

Deposits related to universal life-type and investment-type
    products are credited to policyholder account balances. Revenues
    from such contracts consist of amounts assessed against
    policyholder account balances for mortality, policy
    administration and surrender charges and are recorded in
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees in the
    period in which services are provided. Amounts that are charged
    to operations include interest credited and benefit claims
    incurred in excess of related policyholder account balances.

Premiums related to property and casualty contracts are
    recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the applicable
    contract term. Unearned premiums, representing the portion of
    premium written relating to the unexpired coverage, are included
    in future policy benefits.

Premiums, policy fees, policyholder benefits and expenses are
    presented net of reinsurance.

The portion of fees allocated to embedded derivatives described
    previously is recognized within net investment gains (losses) as
    part of the estimated fair value of embedded derivative.

Other
    Revenues

Other revenues include, in addition to items described elsewhere
    herein, advisory fees, broker-dealer commissions and fees, and
    administrative service fees are also included in other revenues.
    Such fees and commissions are recognized in the period in which
    services are performed. Other revenues also include changes in
    account value relating to corporate-owned life insurance
    (“COLI”). Under certain COLI contracts, if the Company
    reports certain unlikely adverse results in its consolidated
    financial statements, withdrawals would not be immediately
    available and would be subject to market value adjustment, which
    could result in a reduction of the account value.

Policyholder
    Dividends

Policyholder dividends are approved annually by the insurance
    subsidiaries’ boards of directors. The aggregate amount of
    policyholder dividends is related to actual interest, mortality,
    morbidity and expense experience for the year, as well as
    management’s judgment as to the appropriate level of
    statutory surplus to be retained by the insurance subsidiaries.

Income
    Taxes

The Holding Company and its includable life insurance and
    non-life insurance subsidiaries file a consolidated
    U.S. federal income tax return in accordance with the
    provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
    “Code”). Non-includable subsidiaries file either
    separate individual corporate tax returns or separate
    consolidated tax returns.

The Company’s accounting for income taxes represents
    management’s best estimate of various events and
    transactions.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary
    differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
    assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date
    using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in
    the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or
    carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax
    jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are established when
    management determines, based on available information, that it
    is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not
    be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining
    whether valuation allowances should be established as well as
    the amount of such allowances. When making such determination,
    consideration is given to, among other things, the following:

(i)

future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary
    differences and carryforwards;

(ii)

future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;

(iii)

taxable income in prior carryback years; and

(iv)

tax planning strategies.

The Company may be required to change its provision for income
    taxes in certain circumstances. Examples of such circumstances
    include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is
    challenged by taxing authorities (See also Note 15) or
    when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on
    deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new
    information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation
    allowances. Additionally, future events, such as changes in tax
    laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or
    regulations, could have an impact on the provision for income
    tax and the effective tax rate. Any such changes could
    significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
    financial statements in the year these changes occur.

As described more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements,” the Company adopted FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

(“FIN 48”) effective January 1, 2007.
    Under FIN 48, the Company determines whether it is
    more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon
    examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any
    part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements.
    A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that
    is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon
    settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits due to tax uncertainties
    that do not meet the threshold are included within other
    liabilities and are charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

The Company classifies interest recognized as interest expense
    and penalties recognized as a component of income tax.

Reinsurance

The Company enters into reinsurance agreements primarily as a
    purchaser of reinsurance for its various insurance products and
    also as a provider of reinsurance for some insurance products
    issued by third parties.

For each of its reinsurance agreements, the Company determines
    if the agreement provides indemnification against loss or
    liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with
    applicable accounting standards. The Company reviews all
    contractual features, particularly those that may limit the
    amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or
    features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims.

For reinsurance of existing in-force blocks of long-duration
    contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, the
    difference, if any, between the amounts paid (received), and the
    liabilities ceded (assumed) related to the underlying contracts
    is considered the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of
    the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is
    recorded as an adjustment to DAC and recognized as a component
    of other expenses on a basis consistent with the way the
    acquisition costs on the underlying reinsured contracts would be
    recognized. Subsequent amounts paid (received) on the
    reinsurance of in-force blocks, as well as amounts paid
    (received) related to new business, are recorded as ceded
    (assumed) premiums and ceded (assumed) future policy benefit
    liabilities are established.

For prospective reinsurance of short-duration contracts that
    meet the criteria for reinsurance accounting, amounts paid
    (received) are recorded as ceded (assumed) premiums and ceded
    (assumed) unearned premiums and are reflected as a component of
    premiums and other receivables (future policy benefits). Such
    amounts are amortized through earned premiums over the remaining
    contract period in proportion to the amount of protection
    provided. For retroactive reinsurance of short-duration
    contracts that meet the criteria of reinsurance accounting,
    amounts paid (received) in excess of (which do not exceed) the
    related insurance liabilities ceded (assumed) are recognized
    immediately as a loss. Any gains on such retroactive agreements
    are deferred and recorded in other liabilities. The gains are
    amortized primarily using the recovery method.

The assumptions used to account for both long and short-duration
    reinsurance agreements are consistent with those used for the
    underlying contracts. Ceded policyholder and contract related
    liabilities, other than those currently due, are reported gross
    on the balance sheet.

Amounts currently recoverable under reinsurance agreements are
    included in premiums and other receivables and amounts currently
    payable are included in other liabilities. Such assets and
    liabilities relating to reinsurance agreements with the same
    reinsurer may be recorded net on the balance sheet, if a right
    of offset exists within the reinsurance agreement.

Premiums, fees and policyholder benefits and claims include
    amounts assumed under reinsurance agreements and are net of
    reinsurance ceded. Amounts received from reinsurers for policy
    administration are reported in other revenues.

F-27


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

If the Company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not
    expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a
    significant loss from insurance risk, the Company records the
    agreement using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits
    received are included in other liabilities and deposits made are
    included within other assets. As amounts are paid or received,
    consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or
    liabilities are adjusted. Interest on such deposits is recorded
    as other revenues or other expenses, as appropriate.
    Periodically, the Company evaluates the adequacy of the expected
    payments or recoveries and adjusts the deposit asset or
    liability through other revenues or other expenses, as
    appropriate.

Accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions
    and estimates, particularly related to the future performance of
    the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty
    credit risks. The Company periodically reviews actual and
    anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned
    assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to
    ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial
    strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using
    criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment
    process discussed previously.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Certain subsidiaries of the Holding Company (the
    “Subsidiaries”) sponsor

and/or

administer various plans that provide defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefits covering eligible employees
    and sales representatives. A December 31 measurement date is
    used for all of the Subsidiaries’ defined benefit pension
    and other postretirement benefit plans.

Pension benefits are provided utilizing either a traditional
    formula or cash balance formula. The traditional formula
    provides benefits based upon years of credited service and
    either final average or career average earnings. The cash
    balance formula utilizes hypothetical or notional accounts which
    credit participants with benefits equal to a percentage of
    eligible pay, as well as earnings credits, determined annually
    based upon the average annual rate of interest on

30-year

Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2008, virtually all the obligations are
    calculated using the traditional formula.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Pensions

(“SFAS 87”), as amended, established
    the accounting for pension plan obligations. Under SFAS 87,
    the projected pension benefit obligation (“PBO”) is
    defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested
    and non-vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary
    levels. The accumulated pension benefit obligation
    (“ABO”) is the actuarial present value of vested and
    non-vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary
    levels. Obligations, both PBO and ABO, of the defined benefit
    pension plans are determined using a variety of actuarial
    assumptions, from which actual results may vary, as described
    below.

SFAS No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

(“SFAS 106”), as amended, established the
    accounting for expected postretirement plan benefit obligations
    (“EPBO”) which represents the actuarial present value
    of all other postretirement benefits expected to be paid after
    retirement to employees and their dependents. Unlike for
    pensions, the EPBO is not recorded in the financial statements
    but is used in measuring the periodic expense. The accumulated
    postretirement plan benefit obligations (“APBO”)
    represents the actuarial present value of future other
    postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered
    through a particular date and is the valuation basis upon which
    liabilities are established. The APBO is determined using a
    variety of actuarial assumptions, from which actual results may
    vary, as described below.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Prior to December 31, 2006, the funded status of the
    pension and other postretirement plans, which is the difference
    between the estimated fair value of plan assets and the PBO for
    pension plans and the APBO for other postretirement plans
    (collectively, the “Benefit Obligations”), were offset
    by the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses, prior service
    cost and transition obligations to determine prepaid or accrued
    benefit cost, as applicable. The net amount was recorded as a
    prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as applicable. Further, for
    pension plans, if the ABO exceeded the estimated fair value of
    the plan assets, that excess was recorded as an additional
    minimum pension liability with a corresponding intangible asset.
    Recognition of the intangible asset was limited to the amount of
    any unrecognized prior service cost. Any additional minimum
    pension liability in excess of the allowable intangible asset
    was charged, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income.

As described more fully in “Adoption of New Accounting
    Pronouncements,” effective December 31, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106, and SFAS No. 132(r)

(“SFAS
    158”). Effective with the adoption of SFAS 158 on
    December 31, 2006, the Company recognizes the funded status
    of the Benefit Obligations for each of its plans on the
    consolidated balance sheet. The actuarial gains or losses, prior
    service costs and credits, and the remaining net transition
    asset or obligation that had not yet been included in net
    periodic benefit costs at December 31, 2006 are now
    charged, net of income tax, to accumulated other comprehensive
    income. Additionally, these changes eliminated the additional
    minimum pension liability provisions of SFAS 87.

Net periodic benefit cost is determined using management
    estimates and actuarial assumptions to derive service cost,
    interest cost, and expected return on plan assets for a
    particular year. Net periodic benefit cost also includes the
    applicable amortization of any prior service cost (credit)
    arising from the increase (decrease) in prior years’
    benefit costs due to plan amendments or initiation of new plans.
    These costs are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over
    the expected service years of employees whose benefits are
    affected by such plan amendments. Actual experience related to
    plan assets

and/or

the
    benefit obligations may differ from that originally assumed when
    determining net periodic benefit cost for a particular period,
    resulting in gains or losses. To the extent such aggregate gains
    or losses exceed 10 percent of the greater of the benefit
    obligations or the market-related asset value of the plans, they
    are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the expected
    service years of employees expected to receive benefits under
    the plans.

The obligations and expenses associated with these plans require
    an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate,
    expected rate of return on plan assets, rate of future
    compensation increases, healthcare cost trend rates, as well as
    assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and
    age of retirements, withdrawal rates and mortality. Management,
    in consultation with its external consulting actuarial firm,
    determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors
    such as historical performance of the plan and its assets,
    currently available market and industry data, and expected
    benefit payout streams. The assumptions used may differ
    materially from actual results due to, among other factors,
    changing market and economic conditions and changes in
    participant demographics. These differences may have a
    significant effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements and liquidity.

The Subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution savings and
    investment plans (“SIP”) for substantially all
    employees under which a portion of employee contributions are
    matched. Applicable matching contributions are made each payroll
    period. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation cost
    for current matching contributions. As all contributions are
    transferred currently as earned to the SIP trust, no liability
    for matching contributions is recognized in the consolidated
    balance sheets.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted, using the
    modified prospective transition method, SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123(r)”). In accordance with this
    guidance the cost of all stock-based transactions is measured at
    fair value and recognized over the period during which a grantee
    is required to provide goods or services in exchange for the
    award. Although the terms of the Company’s stock-

F-29


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

based plans do not accelerate vesting upon retirement, or the
    attainment of retirement eligibility, the requisite service
    period subsequent to attaining such eligibility is considered
    nonsubstantive. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation
    expense related to stock-based awards over the shorter of the
    requisite service period or the period to attainment of
    retirement eligibility. Prior to January 1, 2006, the
    Company recognized stock-based compensation over the vesting
    period of the grant or award, including grants or awards to
    retirement-eligible employees. An estimation of future
    forfeitures of stock-based awards is incorporated into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. Prior to January 1,
    2006, the Company recognized the corresponding reduction of
    stock compensation in the period in which the forfeitures
    occurred.

Stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2002 but
    prior to January 1, 2006 were accounted for on a
    prospective basis using the fair value accounting method
    prescribed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”), as
    amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure

(“SFAS 148”). The fair value method
    prescribed by SFAS 123 required compensation expense to be
    measured based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the
    grant or award date. Stock-based compensation was recognized
    over the vesting period of the grant or award, including grants
    or awards to retirement-eligible employees.

Foreign
    Currency

Balance sheet accounts of foreign operations are translated at
    the exchange rates in effect at each year-end and income and
    expense accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange
    prevailing during the year. The local currencies of foreign
    operations generally are the functional currencies unless the
    local economy is highly inflationary. Translation adjustments
    are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income
    or loss. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are
    reported as net investment gains (losses) in the period in which
    they occur.

Discontinued
    Operations

The results of operations of a component of the Company that
    either has been disposed of or is classified as held-for-sale
    are reported in discontinued operations if the operations and
    cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from
    the ongoing operations of the Company as a result of the
    disposal transaction and the Company will not have any
    significant continuing involvement in the operations of the
    component after the disposal transaction.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share are computed based on the
    weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
    period. The difference between the number of shares assumed
    issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the
    dilutive shares. Diluted earnings per common share include the
    dilutive effect of the assumed: (i) exercise or issuance of
    stock-based awards using the treasury stock method;
    (ii) settlement of stock purchase contracts underlying
    common equity units using the treasury stock method; and
    (iii) settlement of accelerated common stock repurchase
    contract. Under the treasury stock method, exercise or issuance
    of stock- based awards and settlement of the stock purchase
    contracts underlying common equity units is assumed to occur
    with the proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average
    market price for the period. See Notes 13, 18 and 20.

Litigation
    Contingencies

The Company is a party to a number of legal actions and is
    involved in a number of regulatory investigations. Given the
    inherent unpredictability of these matters, it is difficult to
    estimate the impact on the Company’s financial position.
    Liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has
    been incurred and the amount of the loss can

F-30


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

be reasonably estimated. On a quarterly and annual basis, the
    Company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities
    for litigation, regulatory investigations and litigation-related
    contingencies to be reflected in the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements. It is possible that an adverse outcome in
    certain of the Company’s litigation and regulatory
    investigations, or the use of different assumptions in the
    determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect
    upon the Company’s consolidated net income or cash flows in
    particular quarterly or annual periods.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate accounts are established in conformity with insurance
    laws and are generally not chargeable with liabilities that
    arise from any other business of the Company. Separate account
    assets are subject to general account claims only to the extent
    the value of such assets exceeds the separate account
    liabilities. Assets within the Company’s separate accounts
    primarily include: mutual funds, fixed maturity and equity
    securities, mortgage loans, derivatives, hedge funds, other
    limited partnership interests, short-term investments, and cash
    and cash equivalents. The Company reports separately, as assets
    and liabilities, investments held in separate accounts and
    liabilities of the separate accounts if (i) such separate
    accounts are legally recognized; (ii) assets supporting the
    contract liabilities are legally insulated from the
    Company’s general account liabilities;
    (iii) investments are directed by the contractholder; and
    (iv) all investment performance, net of contract fees and
    assessments, is passed through to the contractholder. The
    Company reports separate account assets meeting such criteria at
    their fair value which is based on the estimated fair values of
    the underlying assets comprising the portfolios of an individual
    separate account. Investment performance (including investment
    income, net investment gains (losses) and changes in unrealized
    gains (losses)) and the corresponding amounts credited to
    contractholders of such separate accounts are offset within the
    same line in the consolidated statements of income. Separate
    accounts not meeting the above criteria are combined on a

line-by-line

basis with the Company’s general account assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and the accounting for these
    investments is consistent with the methodologies described
    herein for similar financial instruments held within the general
    account.

The Company’s revenues reflect fees charged to the separate
    accounts, including mortality charges, risk charges, policy
    administration fees, investment management fees and surrender
    charges.

Adoption
    of New Accounting Pronouncements

Fair
    Value

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS 157 which defines fair value, establishes a consistent
    framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the observability of inputs used to measure
    fair value, and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value
    measurements and applied the provisions of the statement
    prospectively to assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
    The adoption of SFAS 157 changed the valuation of certain
    freestanding derivatives by moving from a mid to bid pricing
    convention as it relates to certain volatility inputs as well as
    the addition of liquidity adjustments and adjustments for risks
    inherent in a particular input or valuation technique. The
    adoption of SFAS 157 also changed the valuation of the
    Company’s embedded derivatives, most significantly the
    valuation of embedded derivatives associated with certain riders
    on variable annuity contracts. The change in valuation of
    embedded derivatives associated with riders on annuity contracts
    resulted from the incorporation of risk margins associated with
    non capital market inputs and the inclusion of the
    Company’s own credit standing in their valuation. At
    January 1, 2008, the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on
    assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value was
    $30 million ($19 million, net of income tax) and was
    recognized as a change in estimate in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of income where it was presented in the
    respective income statement caption to which the item measured
    at estimated fair value is presented. There were no significant
    changes in estimated fair value of items measured at fair value
    and reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
    The addition of risk margins and the Company’s own credit
    spread in the valuation of embedded derivatives associated with
    annuity contracts may result in significant volatility in the
    Company’s

consolidated net income in future periods. Note 24 presents
    the estimated fair value of all assets and liabilities required
    to be measured at estimated fair value as well as the expanded
    fair value disclosures required by SFAS 157.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    the option to measure most financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value at specified election dates and to
    recognize related unrealized gains and losses in earnings. The
    fair value option is applied on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis upon adoption of the standard, upon the acquisition of an
    eligible financial asset, financial liability or firm commitment
    or when certain specified reconsideration events occur. The fair
    value election is an irrevocable election. Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company elected the fair value option
    on fixed maturity and equity securities backing certain pension
    products sold in Brazil. Such securities will now be presented
    as trading securities in accordance with SFAS 115 on the
    consolidated balance sheet with subsequent changes in estimated
    fair value recognized in net investment income. Previously,
    these securities were accounted for as available-for-sale
    securities in accordance with SFAS 115 and unrealized gains
    and losses on these securities were recorded as a separate
    component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The
    Company’s insurance joint venture in Japan also elected the
    fair value option for certain of its existing single premium
    deferred annuities and the assets supporting such liabilities.
    The fair value option was elected to achieve improved reporting
    of the asset/liability matching associated with these products.
    Adoption of SFAS 159 by the Company and its Japanese joint
    venture resulted in an increase in retained earnings of
    $27 million, net of income tax, at January 1, 2008.
    The election of the fair value option resulted in the
    reclassification of $10 million, net of income tax, of net
    unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss) to retained earnings on January 1, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Staff
    Position (“FSP”)

No. FAS 157-1,

Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB Statement
    No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That Address
    Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or
    Measurement under Statement 13

(“FSP 157-1”).

FSP 157-1

amends SFAS 157 to provide a scope out exception for lease
    classification and measurement under SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

. The Company also adopted FSP

No. FAS 157-2,

Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

which
    delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for certain
    nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair
    value on a nonrecurring basis. The effective date is delayed
    until January 1, 2009 and impacts balance sheet items
    including nonfinancial assets and liabilities in a business
    combination and the impairment testing of goodwill and
    long-lived assets.

Effective September 30, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 157-3,

Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset is Not Active

(“FSP 157-3”).

FSP 157-3

provides guidance on how a company’s internal cash flow and
    discount rate assumptions should be considered in the
    measurement of fair value when relevant market data does not
    exist, how observable market information in an inactive market
    affects fair value measurement and how the use of market quotes
    should be considered when assessing the relevance of observable
    and unobservable data available to measure fair value. The
    adoption of

FSP 157-3

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Investments

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8,

Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers
    of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities

(“FSP 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8”).

FSP 140-4

and

FIN 46(r)-8

requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures
    about a transferors’ continuing involvement in transferred
    financial assets and involvement in VIE. The exact nature of the
    additional required VIE disclosures vary and depend on whether
    or not the VIE is a qualifying special-purpose entity
    (“QSPE”). For VIEs that are QSPEs, the additional
    disclosures are only required for a non-transferor sponsor
    holding a variable interest or a non-transferor servicer holding
    a significant variable interest. For VIEs that are not QSPEs,
    the additional disclosures are only required if the Company is
    the primary beneficiary, and

F-32


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

if not the primary beneficiary, only if the Company holds a
    significant variable interest or is the sponsor. The Company
    provided all of the material required disclosures in its
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. EITF 99-20-1,

Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue

No. 99-20

(“FSP

EITF 99-20-1”).

FSP

EITF 99-20-1

amends the guidance in EITF Issue

No. 99-20,

Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased
    Beneficial Interests and Beneficial Interests That Continue to
    Be Held by a Transferor in Securitized Financial Assets,

to
    more closely align the guidance to determine whether an
    other-than-temporary impairment has occurred for a beneficial
    interest in a securitized financial asset with the guidance in
    SFAS 115 for debt securities classified as
    available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. The adoption of FSP

EITF 99-20-1

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 133-1

and

FIN 45-4,

Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain
    Guarantees — An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and
    Clarification of the Effective Date of FASB Statement
    No. 161

(“FSP 133-1

and

FIN 45-4”).

FSP 133-1

and

FIN 45-4

amends SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”) to require certain enhanced
    disclosures by sellers of credit derivatives by requiring
    additional information about the potential adverse effects of
    changes in their credit risk, financial performance, and cash
    flows. It also amends FIN No. 45,

Guarantor’s
    Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
    Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others — An
    Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and
    Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34

(“FIN 45”), to require an additional disclosure
    about the current status of the payment/performance risk of a
    guarantee. The Company provided all of the material required
    disclosures in its consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No.

E-23,

Clarification of the Application of the Shortcut Method

(“Issue

E-23”).

Issue

E-23

amended SFAS 133 by permitting interest rate swaps to have
    a non-zero fair value at inception when applying the shortcut
    method of assessing hedge effectiveness, as long as the
    difference between the transaction price (zero) and the fair
    value (exit price), as defined by SFAS 157, is solely
    attributable to a bid-ask spread. In addition, entities are not
    precluded from applying the shortcut method of assessing hedge
    effectiveness in a hedging relationship of interest rate risk
    involving an interest bearing asset or liability in situations
    where the hedged item is not recognized for accounting purposes
    until settlement date as long as the period between trade date
    and settlement date of the hedged item is consistent with
    generally established conventions in the marketplace. The
    adoption of Issue

E-23

did not
    have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS No. 155,

Accounting for Certain
    Hybrid Instruments

(“SFAS 155”).
    SFAS 155 amends SFAS 133 and SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

(“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 allows financial
    instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for
    as a whole, eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative
    from its host, if the holder elects to account for the whole
    instrument on a fair value basis. In addition, among other
    changes, SFAS 155:

(i)

clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only strips
    are not subject to the requirements of SFAS 133;

(ii)

establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized
    financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding
    derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that
    contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation;

(iii)

clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of
    subordination are not embedded derivatives; and

F-33


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

(iv)

amends SFAS 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a QSPE from
    holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a
    beneficial interest other than another derivative financial
    interest.

The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material impact on
    the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective October 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B40,

Embedded
    Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to Securitized
    Interests in Prepayable Financial Assets

(“Issue
    B40”). Issue B40 clarifies that a securitized interest in
    prepayable financial assets is not subject to the conditions in
    paragraph 13(b) of SFAS 133, if it meets both of the
    following criteria: (i) the right to accelerate the
    settlement if the securitized interest cannot be controlled by
    the investor; and (ii) the securitized interest itself does
    not contain an embedded derivative (including an interest
    rate-related derivative) for which bifurcation would be required
    other than an embedded derivative that results solely from the
    embedded call options in the underlying financial assets. The
    adoption of Issue B40 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B38,

Embedded Derivatives: Evaluation of Net Settlement with
    Respect to the Settlement of a Debt Instrument through Exercise
    of an Embedded Put Option or Call Option

(“Issue
    B38”) and SFAS 133 Implementation Issue No. B39,

Embedded Derivatives: Application of Paragraph 13(b) to
    Call Options That Are Exercisable Only by the Debtor

(“Issue B39”). Issue B38 clarifies that the
    potential settlement of a debtor’s obligation to a creditor
    occurring upon exercise of a put or call option meets the net
    settlement criteria of SFAS 133. Issue B39 clarifies that
    an embedded call option, in which the underlying is an interest
    rate or interest rate index, that can accelerate the settlement
    of a debt host financial instrument should not be bifurcated and
    fair valued if the right to accelerate the settlement can be
    exercised only by the debtor (issuer/borrower) and the investor
    will recover substantially all of its initial net investment.
    The adoption of Issues B38 and B39 did not have a material
    impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income
    Taxes

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48.
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    tax recognized in a company’s financial statements.
    FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is
    “more likely than not” that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities
    before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial
    statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
    measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties,
    along with any related interest and penalties. Previously
    recorded income tax benefits that no longer meet this standard
    are required to be charged to earnings in the period that such
    determination is made.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
    recognized a $35 million increase in the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits and a $9 million decrease in the
    interest liability for unrecognized tax benefits, as well as a
    $17 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits and a $5 million increase in the interest
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits which are included in
    liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale. The corresponding
    reduction to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained
    earnings was $37 million, net of $11 million of
    minority interest included in liabilities of subsidiaries
    held-for-sale. See also Note 15.

Insurance
    Contracts

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted

SOP 05-1

which provides guidance on accounting by insurance enterprises
    for DAC on internal replacements of insurance and investment
    contracts other than those specifically described in
    SFAS No. 97,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance
    Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized
    Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments.

SOP 05-1

defines an internal replacement and is effective for internal
    replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2006. In addition, in February 2007, the
    American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
    (“AICPA”) issued related

F-34


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Technical Practice Aids (“TPAs”) to provide further
    clarification of

SOP 05-1.

The TPAs became effective concurrently with the adoption of

SOP 05-1.

As a result of the adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs, if an internal replacement modification
    substantially changes a contract, then the DAC is written off
    immediately through income and any new deferrable costs
    associated with the new replacement are deferred. If a contract
    modification does not substantially change the contract, the DAC
    amortization on the original contract will continue and any
    acquisition costs associated with the related modification are
    immediately expensed.

The adoption of

SOP 05-1

and the related TPAs resulted in a reduction to DAC and VOBA on
    January 1, 2007 and an acceleration of the amortization
    period relating primarily to the Company’s group life and
    health insurance contracts that contain certain rate reset
    provisions. Prior to the adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts was amortized over the expected renewable
    life of the contract. Upon adoption of

SOP 05-1,

DAC on such contracts is to be amortized over the rate reset
    period. The impact as of January 1, 2007 was a cumulative
    effect adjustment of $292 million, net of income tax of
    $161 million, which was recorded as a reduction to retained
    earnings.

Defined
    Benefit and Other Postretirement Plans

Effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS 158. The pronouncement revises financial reporting
    standards for defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans by requiring the:

(i)

recognition in the statement of financial position of the funded
    status of defined benefit plans measured as the difference
    between the estimated fair value of plan assets and the benefit
    obligation, which is the projected benefit obligation for
    pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit
    obligation for other postretirement benefit plans;

(ii)

recognition as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss), net of income tax, those amounts of actuarial
    gains and losses, prior service costs and credits, and net asset
    or obligation at transition that have not yet been included in
    net periodic benefit costs as of the end of the year of adoption;

(iii)

recognition of subsequent changes in funded status as a
    component of other comprehensive income;

(iv)

measurement of benefit plan assets and obligations as of the
    date of the statement of financial position; and

(v)

disclosure of additional information about the effects on the
    employer’s statement of financial position.

The adoption of SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction of
    $744 million, net of income tax, to accumulated other
    comprehensive income, which is included as a component of total
    consolidated stockholders’ equity. As the Company’s
    measurement date for its pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans is already December 31 there was no impact of
    adoption due to changes in measurement date. See also
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Critical
    Accounting Estimates” and Note 17.

Stock
    Compensation Plans

As described previously, effective January 1, 2006, the
    Company adopted SFAS 123(r) including supplemental
    application guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission in Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”)
    No. 107,

Share Based Payment

using the modified
    prospective transition method. In accordance with the modified
    prospective transition method, results for prior periods have
    not been restated. SFAS 123(r) requires that the cost of
    all stock-based transactions be measured at fair value and
    recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to
    provide goods or services in exchange for the award. The Company
    had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for
    stock-based awards as prescribed by SFAS 123 on a
    prospective basis effective January 1, 2003. The Company
    did not modify the substantive terms of any existing awards
    prior to adoption of SFAS 123(r).

F-35


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Under the modified prospective transition method, compensation
    expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2006
    includes: (a) compensation expense for all stock-based
    awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the original provisions of
    SFAS 123, and (b) compensation expense for all
    stock-based awards granted beginning January 1, 2006, based
    on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 123(r).

The adoption of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant
    impact on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations as all stock-based awards accounted for under the
    intrinsic value method prescribed by APB 25 had vested prior to
    the adoption date and the Company had adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123 on January 1, 2003.

SFAS 123 allowed forfeitures of stock-based awards to be
    recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period
    in which the forfeiture occurred. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 123(r), the Company changed its policy and now
    incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the
    determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense
    over the requisite service period. The impact of this change in
    accounting policy was not significant to the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations as of the date of
    adoption.

Additionally, for awards granted after adoption, the Company
    changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock-based
    awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such
    expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the
    period to attainment of retirement-eligibility. The pro forma
    impact of this change in expense recognition policy for
    stock-based compensation is detailed in Note 18.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(r), the Company presented
    tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock
    options within operating cash flows in the consolidated
    statements of cash flows. SFAS 123(r) requires tax benefits
    resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost
    recognized for those options be classified and reported as a
    financing cash inflow upon adoption of SFAS 123(r).

Other
    Pronouncements

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FSP

No. FIN 39-1,

Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39

(“FSP 39-1”).

FSP 39-1

amends FASB Interpretation No. 39,

Offsetting of Amounts
    Related to Certain Contracts

(“FIN 39”), to
    permit a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts
    recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a
    receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a
    payable) against fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same
    master netting arrangement that have been offset in accordance
    with FIN 39.

FSP 39-1

also amends FIN 39 for certain terminology modifications.
    Upon adoption of

FSP 39-1,

the Company did not change its accounting policy of not
    offsetting fair value amounts recognized for derivative
    instruments under master netting arrangements. The adoption of

FSP 39-1

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 109,

Written Loan Commitments Recorded at
    Fair Value through Earnings

(“SAB 109”),
    which amends SAB No. 105,

Application of Accounting
    Principles to Loan Commitments

. SAB 109 provides
    guidance on (i) incorporating expected net future cash
    flows when related to the associated servicing of a loan when
    measuring fair value; and (ii) broadening the SEC
    staff’s view that internally-developed intangible assets
    should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative
    loan commitment or to written loan commitments that are
    accounted for at fair value through earnings.
    Internally-developed intangible assets are not considered a
    component of the related instruments. The adoption of
    SAB 109 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted Emerging
    Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue

No. 07-6,

Accounting for the Sale of Real Estate When the Agreement
    Includes a Buy-Sell Clause

(“EITF 07-6”)

prospectively.

EITF 07-6

addresses whether the existence of a buy-sell arrangement would
    preclude partial sales treatment when real estate is sold to a
    jointly owned entity.

EITF 07-6

concludes that the existence of a buy-sell

F-36

clause does not necessarily preclude partial sale treatment
    under current guidance. The adoption of

EITF 07-6

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. EITF 00-19-2,

Accounting for Registration Payment Arrangements

(“FSP

EITF 00-19-2”).

FSP

EITF 00-19-2

specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments
    or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment
    arrangement should be separately recognized and measured in
    accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for
    Contingencies. T

he adoption of FSP

EITF 00-19-2

did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FSP

No. FAS 13-2,

Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of
    Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged
    Lease Transaction

(“FSP 13-2”).

FSP 13-2

amends SFAS No. 13,

Accounting for Leases

, to
    require that a lessor review the projected timing of income tax
    cash flows generated by a leveraged lease annually or more
    frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a change in
    timing has occurred or is projected to occur. In addition,

FSP 13-2

requires that the change in the net investment balance resulting
    from the recalculation be recognized as a gain or loss from
    continuing operations in the same line item in which leveraged
    lease income is recognized in the year in which the assumption
    is changed. The adoption of

FSP 13-2

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial
    Assets — an amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 140

(“SFAS 156”). Among other
    requirements, SFAS 156 requires an entity to recognize a
    servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes
    an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a
    servicing contract in certain situations. The adoption of
    SFAS 156 did not have an impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective November 15, 2006, the Company adopted
    SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year
    Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
    Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”).
    SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements
    should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current
    year financial statements for purposes of assessing materiality.
    SAB 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using
    both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate
    whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement
    that, when relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are
    considered, is material. SAB 108 permits companies to
    initially apply its provisions by either restating prior
    financial statements or recording a cumulative effect adjustment
    to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of
    January 1, 2006 with an offsetting adjustment to retained
    earnings for errors that were previously deemed immaterial but
    are material under the guidance in SAB 108. The adoption of
    SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    prospectively EITF Issue

No. 05-7,

Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded
    in Debt Instruments and Related Issues

(“EITF 05-7”).

EITF 05-7

provides guidance on whether a modification of conversion
    options embedded in debt results in an extinguishment of that
    debt. In certain situations, companies may change the terms of
    an embedded conversion option as part of a debt modification.
    The EITF concluded that the change in the fair value of an
    embedded conversion option upon modification should be included
    in the analysis of EITF Issue

No. 96-19,

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of
    Debt Instruments

, to determine whether a modification or
    extinguishment has occurred and that a change in the fair value
    of a conversion option should be recognized upon the
    modification as a discount (or premium) associated with the
    debt, and an increase (or decrease) in additional paid-in
    capital. The adoption of

EITF 05-7

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted EITF Issue

No. 05-8,

Income Tax Consequences of Issuing Convertible Debt with a
    Beneficial Conversion Feature

(“EITF 05-8”).

EITF 05-8

concludes that: (i) the issuance of convertible debt with a
    beneficial conversion feature results in a basis difference that
    should be accounted for as a

F-37

temporary difference; and (ii) the establishment of the
    deferred tax liability for the basis difference should result in
    an adjustment to additional paid-in capital.

EITF 05-8

was applied retrospectively for all instruments with a
    beneficial conversion feature accounted for in accordance with
    EITF Issue

No. 98-5,

Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial
    Conversion Features or Contingently Adjustable Conversion
    Ratios

, and EITF Issue

to Certain Convertible Instruments. T

he adoption of

EITF 05-8

did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error
    Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB
    Statement No. 3

(“SFAS 154”).
    SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior
    periods’ financial statements for a voluntary change in
    accounting principle unless it is deemed impracticable. It also
    requires that a change in the method of depreciation,
    amortization, or depletion for long-lived, non-financial assets
    be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate rather than
    a change in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS 154
    did not have a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

Future
    Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements

Business
    Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (revised 2007),

Business Combinations — A
    Replacement of FASB Statement No. 141

(“SFAS 141(r)”) and SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — An Amendment of ARB No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). Under SFAS 141(r) and
    SFAS 160:

•

All business combinations (whether full, partial or
    “step” acquisitions) result in all assets and
    liabilities of an acquired business being recorded at fair
    value, with limited exceptions.

•

Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred;
    restructuring costs associated with a business combination are
    generally expensed as incurred subsequent to the acquisition
    date.

•

The fair value of the purchase price, including the issuance of
    equity securities, is determined on the acquisition date.

•

Certain acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair
    value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at
    either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under
    existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies.

•

Changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income
    tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect
    income tax expense.

•

Noncontrolling interests (formerly known as “minority
    interests”) are valued at fair value at the acquisition
    date and are presented as equity rather than liabilities.

•

When control is attained on previously noncontrolling interests,
    the previously held equity interests are remeasured at fair
    value and a gain or loss is recognized.

•

Purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a
    change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.

•

When control is lost in a partial disposition, realized gains or
    losses are recorded on equity ownership sold and the remaining
    ownership interest is remeasured and holding gains or losses are
    recognized.

The pronouncements are effective for fiscal years beginning on
    or after December 15, 2008 and apply prospectively to
    business combinations after that date. Presentation and
    disclosure requirements related to noncontrolling interests must
    be retrospectively applied. The Company will apply the guidance
    in SFAS 141(r) prospectively on its accounting for future
    acquisitions and does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160
    to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-6,

Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations

(“EITF 08-6”).

EITF 08-6

addresses a number of issues associated with the impact that
    SFAS 141(r) and SFAS 160 might have on the accounting
    for equity method investments, including how an equity method
    investment should initially be measured, how it should be tested
    for impairment, and how changes in classification from equity
    method to cost method should be treated.

EITF 08-6

is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning on or
    after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the
    adoption of

EITF 08-6

to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In November 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-7,

Accounting for Defensive Intangible Assets

(“EITF 08-7”).

EITF 08-7

requires that an acquired defensive intangible asset (i.e., an
    asset an entity does not intend to actively use, but rather,
    intends to prevent others from using) be accounted for as a
    separate unit of accounting at time of acquisition, not combined
    with the acquirer’s existing intangible assets. In
    addition, the EITF concludes that a defensive intangible asset
    may not be considered immediately abandoned following its
    acquisition or have indefinite life. The Company will apply the
    guidance of

EITF 08-7

prospectively to its intangible assets acquired after fiscal
    years beginning on or after December 15, 2008.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 142-3,

Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets

(“FSP 142-3”).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”). This change is intended to
    improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized
    intangible asset under SFAS 142 and the period of expected
    cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under
    SFAS 141(r) and other GAAP.

FSP 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The requirement for determining
    useful lives and related disclosures will be applied
    prospectively to intangible assets acquired as of, and
    subsequent to, the effective date.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities

—

An Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 133

(“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161
    requires enhanced qualitative disclosures about objectives and
    strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about
    fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative
    instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related
    contingent features in derivative agreements. SFAS 161 is
    effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
    interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The
    Company will provide all of the material required disclosures in
    the appropriate future interim and annual periods.

Other
    Pronouncements

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. FAS 132(r)-1,

Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan
    Assets

(“FSP 132(r)-1”). FSP 132(r)-1
    amends SFAS No. 132(r),

Employers’ Disclosures
    about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

to enhance
    the transparency surrounding the types of assets and associated
    risks in an employer’s defined benefit pension or other
    postretirement plan. The FSP requires an employer to disclose
    information about the valuation of plan assets similar to that
    required under SFAS 157. FSP 132(r)-1 is effective for
    fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company
    will provide all of the material required disclosures in the
    appropriate future annual period.

In September 2008, the FASB ratified the consensus on EITF Issue

No. 08-5,

Issuer’s Accounting for Liabilities Measured at Fair
    Value with a Third-Party Credit Enhancement

(“EITF 08-5”).

EITF 08-5

concludes that an issuer of a liability with a third-party
    credit enhancement should not include the effect of the credit
    enhancement in the fair value measurement of the liability. In
    addition,

EITF 08-5

requires disclosures about the existence of any third-party
    credit enhancement related to liabilities that are measured at
    fair value.

EITF 08-5

EITF 07-5

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008 and must be applied by
    recording a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance
    of retained earnings at the date of adoption. The Company does
    not expect the adoption of

Acquisitions
    and Dispositions

Disposition
    of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated

On September 12, 2008, the Company completed a tax-free
    split-off of its majority-owned subsidiary, Reinsurance Group of
    America, Incorporated (“RGA”). The Company and RGA
    entered into a recapitalization and distribution agreement,
    pursuant to which the Company agreed to divest substantially all
    of its 52% interest in RGA to the Company’s stockholders.
    The split-off was effected through the following:

•

A recapitalization of RGA common stock into two classes of
    common stock — RGA Class A common stock and RGA
    Class B common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the
    recapitalization, each outstanding share of RGA common stock,
    including the 32,243,539 shares of RGA common stock
    beneficially owned by the Company and its subsidiaries, was
    reclassified as one share of RGA Class A common stock.
    Immediately thereafter, the Company and its subsidiaries
    exchanged 29,243,539 shares of its RGA Class A common
    stock — which represented all of the RGA Class A
    common stock beneficially owned by the Company and its
    subsidiaries other than 3,000,000 shares of RGA
    Class A common stock — with RGA for
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock.

•

An exchange offer, pursuant to which the Company offered to
    acquire MetLife common stock from its stockholders in exchange
    for all of its 29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common
    stock. The exchange ratio was determined based upon a
    ratio — as more specifically described in the exchange
    offering document — of the value of the MetLife and
    RGA shares during the

three-day

period prior to the closing of the exchange offer. The
    3,000,000 shares of the RGA Class A common stock were
    not subject to the tax-free exchange.

As a result of completion of the recapitalization and exchange
    offer, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA’s Class B common stock
    with a net book value of $1,716 million. The resulting loss
    on disposition, inclusive of transaction costs of
    $60 million, was $458 million. The
    3,000,000 shares of RGA Class A common stock retained
    by the Company are marketable equity securities which do not
    constitute significant continuing involvement in the operations
    of RGA; accordingly, they have been classified within equity
    securities in the consolidated financial statements of the
    Company at a cost basis of $157 million which is equivalent
    to the net book value of the shares. The cost basis will be
    adjusted to fair value at each subsequent reporting date. The
    Company has agreed to dispose of the remaining shares of RGA
    within the next five years. In connection with the
    Company’s agreement to dispose of the remaining shares, the
    Company also

MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

recognized, in its provision for income tax on continuing
    operations, a deferred tax liability of $16 million which
    represents the difference between the book and taxable basis of
    the remaining investment in RGA.

The impact of the disposition of the Company’s investment
    in RGA is reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements as discontinued operations. The disposition of RGA
    results in the elimination of the Company’s Reinsurance
    segment. The Reinsurance segment was comprised of the results of
    RGA, which at disposition became discontinued operations of
    Corporate & Other, and the interest on economic
    capital, which has been reclassified to the continuing
    operations of Corporate & Other. See Note 23 for
    reclassifications related to discontinued operations and
    Note 22 for segment information.

Disposition
    of Texas Life Insurance Company

MetLife, Inc. has entered into an agreement to sell Cova
    Corporation (“Cova”), the parent company of Texas Life
    Insurance Company, to a third party in the fourth quarter of
    2008. The transaction is expected to close in early 2009. As a
    result of the sale agreement, the Company recognized gains from
    discontinued operations of $37 million, net of income tax,
    in the fourth quarter of 2008. The gain was comprised of
    recognition of tax benefits of $65 million relating to the
    excess of outside tax basis of Cova over its financial reporting
    basis, offset by other than temporary impairments of
    $28 million, net of income tax, relating to Cova’s
    investments. The Company has reclassified the assets and
    liabilities of Cova as held-for-sale and its operations into
    discontinued operations for all periods presented in the
    consolidated financial statements. See also Note 23.

    Acquisitions

During 2008, the Company made five acquisitions for
    $783 million. As a result of these acquisitions,
    MetLife’s Institutional segment increased its product
    offering of dental and vision benefit plans, MetLife Bank within
    Corporate & Other entered the mortgage origination and
    servicing business and the International segment increased its
    presence in Mexico and Brazil. The acquisitions were each
    accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and
    accordingly, commenced being included in the operating results
    of the Company upon their respective closing dates. Total
    consideration paid by the Company for these acquisitions
    consisted of $763 million in cash and $20 million in
    transaction costs. The net fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed totaled $527 million, resulting in
    goodwill of $256 million. Goodwill increased by
    $122 million, $73 million and $61 million in the
    International segment, Institutional segment and
    Corporate & Other, respectively. The goodwill is
    deductible for tax purposes. VOCRA, VOBA and other intangibles
    increased by $137 million, $7 million and
    $6 million, respectively, as a result of these
    acquisitions. Further information on VOBA, goodwill and VOCRA is
    provided in Notes 5, 6 and 7, respectively.

    Acquisition and Disposition

On June 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50%
    interest in a joint venture in Hong Kong, MetLife Fubon Limited
    (“MetLife Fubon”), for $56 million in cash,
    resulting in MetLife Fubon becoming a consolidated subsidiary of
    the Company. The transaction was treated as a step acquisition,
    and at June 30, 2007, total assets and liabilities of
    MetLife Fubon of $839 million and $735 million,
    respectively, were included in the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet. The Company’s investment for the initial 50%
    interest in MetLife Fubon was $48 million. The Company used
    the equity method of accounting for such investment in MetLife
    Fubon. The Company’s share of the joint venture’s
    results for the six months ended June 30, 2007, was a loss
    of $3 million. The fair value of the assets acquired and
    the liabilities assumed in the step acquisition at June 30,
    2007, was $427 million and $371 million, respectively.
    No additional goodwill was recorded as a part of the step
    acquisition. As a result of this acquisition, additional VOBA
    and VODA of $45 million and $5 million, respectively,
    were recorded and both have a weighted average amortization
    period of 16 years. In June 2008, the Company revised the
    valuation of certain long-term liabilities, VOBA, and VODA based
    on new information received. As a result, the fair value of
    acquired insurance liabilities and VOBA were reduced by
    $5 million and $12 million, respectively, offset by an
    increase in

F-41


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

VODA of $7 million. The revised VOBA and VODA have a
    weighted average amortization period of 11 years. Further
    information on VOBA and VODA is described in Notes 5 and 7,
    respectively.

On June 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of its
    Bermuda insurance subsidiary, MetLife International Insurance,
    Ltd. (“MLII”), to a third party for $33 million
    in cash consideration, resulting in a gain upon disposal of
    $3 million, net of income tax. The net assets of MLII at
    disposal were $27 million. A liability of $1 million
    was recorded with respect to a guarantee provided in connection
    with this disposition. Further information on guarantees is
    described in Note 16.

Other
    Acquisitions and Dispositions

On July 1, 2005, the Company completed the acquisition of
    Travelers for $12.1 billion. The acquisition was accounted
    for using the purchase method of accounting. The net fair value
    of assets acquired and liabilities assumed totaled
    $7.8 billion, resulting in goodwill of $4.3 billion.
    The initial consideration paid by the Company in 2005 for the
    acquisition consisted of $10.9 billion in cash and
    22,436,617 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1.0 billion to Citigroup and
    $100 million in other transaction costs. The Company
    revised the purchase price as a result of the finalization by
    both parties of their review of the June 30, 2005 financial
    statements and final resolution as to the interpretation of the
    provisions of the acquisition agreement which resulted in a
    payment of additional consideration of $115 million by the
    Company to Citigroup in 2006.

The Company classifies perpetual securities that have attributes
    of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities if the
    security has a punitive interest rate

step-up

feature as it believes in most instances this feature will
    compel the issuer to redeem the security at the specified call
    date. Perpetual securities that do not have a punitive interest
    rate

step-up

feature are classified as non-redeemable preferred stock. Many
    of such securities have been issued by

non-U.S.

financial institutions that are accorded Tier 1 and Upper
    Tier 2 capital treatment by their respective regulatory
    bodies and are commonly referred to as “perpetual hybrid
    securities.” Perpetual hybrid securities classified as
    non-redeemable preferred stock held by the Company at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 had an estimated fair value of
    $1,224 million and $2,051 million, respectively. In
    addition, the Company held $288 million and
    $923 million at estimated fair value, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 of other perpetual hybrid
    securities, primarily U.S. financial institutions, also included
    in non-redeemable preferred stock. Perpetual hybrid securities
    held by the Company and included within fixed maturity
    securities (primarily within foreign corporate securities) at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 had an estimated fair value of
    $2,110 million and $3,896 million, respectively. In
    addition, the Company held $46 million and $57 million
    at estimated fair value, respectively, at December 31, 2008
    and 2007 of other perpetual hybrid securities, primarily U.S.
    financial institutions, included in fixed maturity securities.

(2)

At December 31, 2008 and 2007 the Company also held
    $2,052 million and $3,432 million at estimated fair
    value, respectively, of redeemable preferred stock which have
    stated maturity dates which are included within fixed maturity
    securities. These securities are primarily issued by U.S.
    financial institutions, have cumulative interest deferral
    features and are commonly referred to as “capital
    securities” within U.S. corporate securities.

The Company held foreign currency derivatives with notional
    amounts of $9.1 billion and $9.2 billion to hedge the
    exchange rate risk associated with foreign denominated fixed
    maturity securities at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Below Investment Grade or Non Rated Fixed Maturity
    Securities.

The Company held fixed maturity securities at
    estimated fair values that were below investment grade or not
    rated by an independent rating agency that totaled
    $12.4 billion and $17.4 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. These securities had net unrealized
    losses of $5,094 million and $103 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Non-Income Producing Fixed Maturity Securities.

Non-income producing fixed maturity securities at estimated
    fair value were $75 million and $12 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net unrealized
    gains (losses) associated with non-income producing fixed
    maturity securities were ($19) million and $11 million
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Fixed Maturity Securities Credit Enhanced by Financial
    Guarantee Insurers.

At December 31, 2008,
    $4.9 billion of the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s fixed maturity securities were credit enhanced by
    financial guarantee insurers of which $2.0 billion,
    $2.0 billion and $0.9 billion, are included within
    state and political subdivision securities, U.S. corporate
    securities, and asset-backed securities, respectively, and 15%
    and 68% were guaranteed by financial guarantee insurers who were
    Aa and Baa rated, respectively. As described below, all of the
    asset-backed securities that are credit enhanced by financial
    guarantee insurers are asset-backed securities which are backed
    by sub-prime mortgage loans.

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity Securities).

The following section contains a summary of the
    concentrations of credit risk related to fixed maturity
    securities holdings.

The Company is not exposed to any concentrations of credit risk
    of any single issuer greater than 10% of the Company’s
    stockholders’ equity, other than securities of the
    U.S. government and certain U.S. government agencies.
    At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s holdings
    in U.S. Treasury and agency fixed maturity securities at
    estimated fair value were $21.3 billion and
    $21.2 billion, respectively. As shown in the sector table
    above, at December 31, 2008 the Company’s three
    largest exposures in its fixed maturity security portfolio were
    U.S. corporate fixed maturity securities (33.6%),
    residential mortgage-backed securities (19.2%), and foreign
    corporate securities (15.8%); and at December 31, 2007 were
    U.S. corporate fixed maturity securities (31.8%),
    residential mortgage-backed securities (23.7%), and foreign
    corporate securities (16.0%).

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — U.S. and Foreign Corporate
    Securities.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s holdings in U.S. corporate and foreign
    corporate fixed maturity securities at estimated fair value were
    $93.0 billion and $111.1 billion, respectively. The
    Company maintains a diversified portfolio of corporate
    securities across industries and issuers. The portfolio does not
    have exposure to any single issuer in excess of 1% of total
    invested assets. The exposure to the largest single issuer of
    corporate fixed maturity securities held at December 31,
    2008 and 2007 was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion,
    respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s combined holdings in the ten issuers to which it
    had the greatest exposure totaled $8.4 billion and
    $7.8 billion, respectively, the total of these ten issuers
    being less than 3% of the Company’s total invested assets
    at such dates. The table below shows the major industry types
    that comprise the corporate fixed maturity holdings at:

Collateralized mortgage obligations are a type of
    mortgage-backed security that creates separate pools or tranches
    of pass-through cash flows for different classes of bondholders
    with varying maturities. Pass-through mortgage-backed securities
    are a type of asset-backed security that is secured by a
    mortgage or collection of mortgages. The monthly mortgage
    payments from homeowners pass from the originating bank through
    an intermediary, such as a government agency or investment bank,
    which collects the payments, and for fee, remits or passes these
    payments through to the holders of the pass-through securities.

At December 31, 2008, the exposures in the Company’s
    residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio consist of
    agency, prime, and alternative residential mortgage loans
    (“Alt-A”) securities of 68%, 23%, and 9% of the total
    holdings, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    $33.3 billion and $54.7 billion, respectively, or 92%
    and 99% respectively of the residential mortgage-backed
    securities were rated Aaa/AAA by Moody’s Investors Service
    (“Moody’s”), S&P, or Fitch Ratings
    (“Fitch”). The majority of the agency residential
    mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed or otherwise supported
    by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home
    Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Government National Mortgage
    Association. Prime residential mortgage lending includes the
    origination of residential mortgage loans to the most
    credit-worthy customers with high quality credit profiles. Alt-A
    residential mortgage loans are a classification of mortgage
    loans where the risk profile of the borrower falls between prime
    and sub-prime. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company’s Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities
    exposure was $3.4 billion and $6.3 billion,
    respectively, with an unrealized loss of $1,963 million and
    $139 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, $2.1 billion and $6.3 billion,
    respectively, or 63% and 99%, respectively, of the
    Company’s Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities were
    rated Aa/AA or better by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch. In
    December 2008, certain Alt-A residential mortgage-backed
    securities experienced ratings downgrades from investment grade
    to below investment grade, contributing to the decrease year
    over year cited above in those securities rated Aa/AA or better.
    At December 31, 2008 the Company’s Alt-A holdings are
    distributed as follows: 23% 2007 vintage year, 25% 2006 vintage
    year; and 52% in the 2005 and prior vintage years. In January
    2009, Moody’s revised its loss projections for Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities, and the Company
    anticipates that Moody’s will be downgrading virtually all
    2006 and 2007 vintage year Alt-A securities to below investment
    grade, which will increase the percentage of our Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio that will be
    rated below investment grade. Vintage year refers to the year of
    origination and not to the year of purchase.

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s
    holdings in commercial mortgage-backed securities was
    $12.6 billion and $17.0 billion, respectively, at
    estimated fair value. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    $11.8 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively, of the
    estimated fair value, or 93% and 88%, respectively, of the
    commercial mortgage-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. At December 31, 2008, the
    rating distribution of

the Company’s commercial mortgage-backed securities
    holdings was as follows: 93% Aaa, 4% Aa, 1% A, 1% Baa, and 1% Ba
    or below. At December 31, 2008, 84% of the holdings are in
    the 2005 and prior vintage years. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had no exposure to CMBX securities and its holdings of
    commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations
    (“CRE-CDO”) securities was $121 million at
    estimated fair value.

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Fixed Maturity
    Securities) — Asset-Backed
    Securities.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the Company’s holdings in asset-backed securities was
    $10.5 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively, at
    estimated fair value. The Company’s asset-backed securities
    are diversified both by sector and by issuer. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, $7.9 billion and
    $5.7 billion, respectively, or 75% and 54%, respectively,
    of total asset-backed securities were rated Aaa/AAA by
    Moody’s, S&P or Fitch. At December 31, 2008, the
    largest exposures in the Company’s asset-backed securities
    portfolio were credit card receivables, residential
    mortgage-backed securities backed by sub-prime mortgage loans,
    automobile receivables and student loan receivables of 49%, 10%,
    10% and 10% of the total holdings, respectively. Sub-prime
    mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage
    loans to customers with weak credit profiles. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had exposure to
    fixed maturity securities backed by sub-prime mortgage loans
    with estimated fair values of $1.1 billion and
    $2.0 billion, respectively, and unrealized losses of
    $730 million and $198 million, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, 37% of the asset-backed securities
    backed by sub-prime mortgage loans have been guaranteed by
    financial guarantee insurers, of which 19% and 37% were
    guaranteed by financial guarantee insurers who were Aa and Baa
    rated, respectively.

Concentrations of Credit Risk (Equity
    Securities).

The Company is not exposed to any
    concentrations of credit risk of any single issuer greater than
    10% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity in its
    equity securities holdings.

As described more fully in Note 1, the Company performs a
    regular evaluation, on a

security-by-security

basis, of its investment holdings in accordance with its
    impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities
    are other-than-temporarily impaired. One of the criteria which
    the Company considers in its other-than-temporary impairment
    analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their
    value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized
    cost. The Company’s intent and ability to hold securities
    considers broad portfolio management objectives such as
    asset/liability duration management, issuer and industry segment
    exposures, interest rate views and the overall total return
    focus. In following these portfolio management objectives,
    changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past
    reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that
    were held in prior reporting periods. Decisions to sell are
    based on current conditions or the Company’s need to shift
    the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives
    including liquidity needs or duration targets on asset/liability
    managed portfolios. The Company attempts to anticipate these
    types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an
    impaired security and that security is not expected to recover
    prior to the expected time of sale, the security will be deemed
    other-than-temporarily impaired in the period that the sale
    decision was made and an other-than-temporary impairment loss
    will be recognized.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $8.0 billion and
    $3.9 billion, respectively, of unrealized losses related to
    fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss position of
    less than 20% of cost or amortized cost, which represented 9%
    and 4%, respectively, of the cost or amortized cost of such
    securities. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $75 million
    and $316 million, respectively, of unrealized losses
    related to equity securities with an unrealized loss position of
    less than 20% of cost, which represented 13% and 10%,
    respectively, of the cost of such securities.

At December 31, 2008, $20.8 billion and
    $903 million of unrealized losses related to fixed maturity
    securities and equity securities, respectively, with an
    unrealized loss position of 20% or more of cost or amortized
    cost, which represented 38% and 43% of the cost or amortized
    cost of such fixed maturity securities and equity securities,

respectively. Of such unrealized losses of $20.8 billion
    and $903 million, $17.2 billion and $519 million
    related to fixed maturity securities and equity securities,
    respectively, that were in an unrealized loss position for a
    period of less than six months. At December 31, 2007,
    $402 million and $133 million of unrealized losses
    related to fixed maturity securities and equity securities,
    respectively, with an unrealized loss position of 20% or more of
    cost or amortized cost, which represented 28% and 31% of the
    cost or amortized cost of such fixed maturity securities and
    equity securities, respectively. Of such unrealized losses of
    $402 million and $133 million, $383 million and
    $133 million related to fixed maturity securities and
    equity securities, respectively, that were in an unrealized loss
    position for a period of less than six months.

The Company held 699 fixed maturity securities and 33 equity
    securities, each with a gross unrealized loss at
    December 31, 2008 of greater than $10 million. These
    699 fixed maturity securities represented 50% or
    $14.5 billion in the aggregate, of the gross unrealized
    loss on fixed maturity securities. These 33 equity securities
    represented 71% or $699 million in the aggregate, of the
    gross unrealized loss on equity securities. The Company held 23
    fixed maturity securities and six equity securities, each with a
    gross unrealized loss at December 31, 2007 of greater than
    $10 million. These 23 fixed maturity securities represented
    8% or $357 million in the aggregate, of the gross
    unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities. These six equity
    securities represented 20% or $90 million in the aggregate,
    of the gross unrealized loss on equity securities. The fixed
    maturity and equity securities, each with a gross unrealized
    loss greater than $10 million increased $14.7 billion
    during the year ended December 31, 2008. These securities
    were included in the regular evaluation of whether such
    securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. Based upon the
    Company’s current evaluation of these securities in
    accordance with its impairment policy, the cause of the decline
    being primarily attributable to a rise in market yields caused
    principally by an extensive widening of credit spreads which
    resulted from a lack of market liquidity and a short-term market
    dislocation versus a long-term deterioration in credit quality,
    and the Company’s current intent and ability to hold the
    fixed maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for
    a period of time sufficient for them to recover, the Company has
    concluded that these securities are not other-than-temporarily
    impaired.

In the Company’s impairment review process, the duration
    of, and severity of, an unrealized loss position, such as
    unrealized losses of 20% or more for equity securities, which
    was $903 million and $133 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, is given greater weight and
    consideration, than for fixed maturity securities. An extended
    and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security
    may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service
    all scheduled interest and principal payments and the
    Company’s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual
    cash flows, as well as the Company’s ability and intent to
    hold the security, including holding the security until the
    earlier of a recovery in value, or until maturity. In contrast,
    for an equity security, greater weight and consideration is
    given by the Company to a decline in market value and the
    likelihood such market value decline will recover.

Equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20% or more for six
    months or greater was $384 million at December 31,
    2008, of which $382 million of the unrealized losses, or
    99%, are for non-redeemable preferred securities, of which,
    $377 million of the unrealized losses, or 99%, are for
    investment grade non-redeemable preferred securities. Of the
    $377 million of unrealized losses for investment grade
    non-redeemable preferred securities, $372 million of the
    unrealized losses, or 99%, was comprised of unrealized losses on
    investment grade financial services industry non-redeemable
    preferred securities, of which 85% are rated A or higher.

Equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20% or more for
    less than six months was $519 million at December 31,
    2008 of which $427 million of the unrealized losses, or
    82%, are for non-redeemable preferred securities, of which
    $421 million, of the unrealized losses, or 98% are for
    investment grade non-redeemable preferred securities. Of the
    $421 million of unrealized losses for investment grade
    non-redeemable preferred securities, $417 million of the
    unrealized losses, or 99%, was comprised of unrealized losses on
    investment grade financial services industry non-redeemable
    preferred securities, of which 81% are rated A or higher.

There were no equity securities with an unrealized loss of 20%
    or more for twelve months or greater.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

In connection with the equity securities impairment review
    process during 2008, the Company evaluated its holdings in
    non-redeemable preferred securities, particularly those of
    financial services industry companies. The Company considered
    several factors including whether there has been any
    deterioration in credit of the issuer and the likelihood of
    recovery in value of non-redeemable preferred securities with a
    severe or an extended unrealized loss. With respect to common
    stock holdings, the Company considered the duration and severity
    of the securities in an unrealized loss position of 20% or more;
    and the duration of securities in an unrealized loss position of
    20% or less with in an extended unrealized loss position (i.e.,
    12 months or more).

At December 31, 2008, there are $903 million of equity
    securities with an unrealized loss of 20% or more, of which
    $809 million of the unrealized losses, or 90%, were for
    non-redeemable preferred securities. Through December 31,
    2008, $798 million of the unrealized losses of 20% or more,
    or 99%, of the non-redeemable preferred securities were
    investment grade securities, of which, $789 million of the
    unrealized losses of 20% or more, or 99%, are investment grade
    financial services industry non-redeemable preferred securities;
    and all non-redeemable preferred securities with unrealized
    losses of 20% or more, regardless of rating, have not deferred
    any dividend payments.

Also, the Company believes the unrealized loss position is not
    necessarily predictive of the ultimate performance of these
    securities, and with respect to fixed maturity securities, it
    has the ability and intent to hold until the earlier of the
    recovery in value, or until maturity, and with respect to equity
    securities, it has the ability and intent to hold until the
    recovery in value. Future other-than-temporary impairments will
    depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance,
    changes in collateral valuation, changes in interest rates, and
    changes in credit spreads. If economic fundamentals and other of
    the above factors continue to deteriorate, additional
    other-than-temporary impairments may be incurred in upcoming
    quarters.

Other-than credit-related writedowns include items such as
    equity securities where the primary reason for the writedown was
    the severity and/or the duration of an unrealized loss position
    and fixed maturity securities where an interest-rate related
    writedown was taken.

The Company periodically disposes of fixed maturity and equity
    securities at a loss. Generally, such losses are insignificant
    in amount or in relation to the cost basis of the investment,
    are attributable to declines in fair value occurring in the
    period of the disposition or are as a result of
    management’s decision to sell securities based on current
    conditions or the Company’s need to shift the portfolio to
    maintain its portfolio management objectives.

Losses from fixed maturity and equity securities deemed
    other-than-temporarily impaired, included within net investment
    gains (losses), were $1,726 million, $97 million and
    $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The substantial increase in 2008
    over 2007 was driven by writedowns totaling $1,014 million
    of financial services industry securities holdings, comprised of
    $673 million of fixed maturity securities and
    $341 million of equity securities.

Overall, of the $1,296 million of fixed maturity security
    writedowns in 2008, $673 million were on financial services
    industry services holdings; $241 million were on
    communication and consumer industries holdings;

$164 million on asset-backed (substantially all are backed
    by or exposed to sub-prime mortgage loans) and below investment
    grade commercial mortgage-backed holdings; and $218 million
    in fixed maturity security holdings that the Company either
    lacked the intent to hold, or due to extensive credit spread
    widening, the Company was uncertain of its intent to hold these
    fixed maturity securities for a period of time sufficient to
    allow for recovery of the market value decline.

Included within the $430 million of writedowns on equity
    securities in 2008 are $341 million related to the
    financial services industry holdings, (of which,
    $90 million related to the financial services industry
    non-redeemable preferred securities) and $89 million across
    several industries including consumer, communications,
    industrial and utility.

    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Net investment income from other limited partnership interests,
    including hedge funds, represents distributions from other
    limited partnership interests accounted for under the cost
    method and equity in earnings from other limited partnership
    interests accounted for under the equity method. Overall for
    2008, the net amount recognized by the Company was a loss of
    ($170) million resulting principally from losses on equity
    method investments. Such earnings and losses recognized for
    other limited partnership interests are impacted by volatility
    in the equity and credit markets. Net investment income from
    trading securities includes interest and dividends earned on
    trading securities in addition to the net realized and
    unrealized gains (losses) recognized on trading securities and
    the short sale agreements liabilities. In 2008, unrealized
    losses recognized on trading securities, due to the volatility
    in the equity and credit markets, were in excess of interest and
    dividends earned.

Securities
    Lending

The Company participates in securities lending programs whereby
    blocks of securities, which are included in fixed maturity
    securities and short-term investments are loaned to third
    parties, primarily major brokerage firms and commercial banks.
    The Company generally obtains collateral in an amount equal to
    102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned.
    Securities with a cost or amortized cost of $20.8 billion
    and $41.1 billion and an estimated fair value of
    $22.9 billion and $42.1 billion were on loan under the
    program at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or
    repledged by the transferee. The Company was liable for cash
    collateral under its control of $23.3 billion and
    $43.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Of this $23.3 billion of cash collateral at
    December 31, 2008, $5.1 billion was on open terms,
    meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to
    the Company on the next business day requiring return of cash
    collateral, and $14.7 billion and $3.5 billion,
    respectively, were due within 30 days and 60 days. Of
    the $5.0 billion of estimated fair value of the securities
    related to the cash collateral on open at December 31,
    2008, $4.4 billion were U.S. Treasury and agency
    securities which, if put to the Company, can be immediately sold
    to satisfy the cash requirements. The remainder of the
    securities on loan are primarily U.S. Treasury and agency
    securities, and very liquid residential mortgage-backed
    securities. The estimated fair value of the reinvestment
    portfolio acquired with the cash collateral was
    $19.5 billion at December 31, 2008, and consisted
    principally of fixed maturity securities (including residential
    mortgage-backed, asset-backed, U.S. corporate and foreign
    corporate securities).

Security collateral of $279 million and $40 million on
    deposit from counterparties in connection with the securities
    lending transactions at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively may not be sold or repledged and is not reflected
    in the consolidated financial statements.

Assets
    on Deposit, Held in Trust and Pledged as
    Collateral

The Company had investment assets on deposit with regulatory
    agencies with an estimated fair value of $1.3 billion and
    $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, consisting primarily of fixed maturity and equity
    securities. The Company also held in trust cash and securities,
    primarily fixed maturity and equity securities with an estimated
    fair value of $9.3 billion and $5.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, to satisfy
    collateral requirements. The Company has also pledged certain
    fixed maturity securities in support of the collateral financing
    arrangements described in Note 11.

The Company has pledged fixed maturity securities and mortgage
    loans in support of its debt and funding agreements with the
    Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB of NY”) and
    the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB of
    Boston”) of $22.2 billion and $7.0 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company has
    also pledged certain agricultural real estate mortgage loans in
    connection with funding agreements with the Federal Agricultural
    Mortgage Corporation with a carrying value of $2.9 billion
    at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company has also
    pledged qualifying mortgage loans and securities in connection
    with collateralized borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of
    New York’s Term Auction Facility with an estimated fair
    value of $1.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The nature
    of these Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Agricultural Mortgage
    Corporation and Federal Reserve Bank of New York arrangements
    are described in Notes 7 and 10.

Certain of the Company’s invested assets are pledged as
    collateral for various derivative transactions as described in
    Note 4. Certain of the Company’s trading securities
    are pledged to secure liabilities associated with short sale
    agreements in the trading securities portfolio as described in
    the following section.

Trading
    Securities

The Company has a trading securities portfolio to support
    investment strategies that involve the active and frequent
    purchase and sale of securities, the execution of short sale
    agreements and asset and liability matching

strategies for certain insurance products. Trading securities
    and short sale agreement liabilities are recorded at estimated
    fair value with subsequent changes in estimated fair value
    recognized in net investment income.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, trading securities at
    estimated fair value were $946 million and
    $779 million, respectively, and liabilities associated with
    the short sale agreements in the trading securities portfolio,
    which were included in other liabilities, were $57 million
    and $107 million, respectively. The Company had pledged
    $346 million and $407 million of its assets, at
    estimated fair value, primarily consisting of trading
    securities, as collateral to secure the liabilities associated
    with the short sale agreements in the trading securities
    portfolio at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Interest and dividends earned on trading securities in addition
    to the net realized and unrealized gains (losses) recognized on
    the trading securities and the related short sale agreement
    liabilities included within net investment income totaled
    ($193) million, $50 million and $71 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Included within unrealized gains (losses) on such
    trading securities and short sale agreement liabilities are
    changes in estimated fair value of ($174) million,
    ($4) million and $26 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans by Geographic Region and Property
    Type

— The Company diversifies its mortgage loans
    by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of
    concentration. Mortgage loans are collateralized by properties
    primarily located in the United States. At December 31,
    2008, 20%, 7% and 6% of the value of the Company’s mortgage
    and consumer loans were located in California, Texas and
    Florida, respectively. Generally, the Company, as the lender,
    only loans up to 75% of the purchase price of the underlying
    real estate. As shown in the table above, commercial mortgage
    loans at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were
    $36,197 million and $34,824 million, respectively, or
    72.9% and 75.1%, respectively, of total mortgage and consumer
    loans prior to valuation allowances. Net of valuation allowances
    commercial mortgage loans were $35,965 million and

The Company recognizes the rights to service residential

    either acquired or are generated from the sale of originated
    residential mortgage loans where the servicing rights are
    retained by the Company. MSR’s are carried at estimated
    fair value and changes in estimated fair value, primarily due to
    changes in valuation inputs and assumptions and to the
    collection of expected cash flows, are reported in other
    revenues in the period in which the change occurs. See also

The maximum exposure to loss relating to the fixed maturity
    securities available-for-sale and equity securities
    available-for-sale is equal to the carrying amounts or carrying
    amounts of retained interests. The maximum exposure to loss
    relating to the real estate joint ventures and other limited
    partnership interests is equal to the carrying amounts plus any
    unfunded commitments. Such a maximum loss would be expected to
    occur only upon bankruptcy of the issuer or investee. For
    certain of its investments in other invested assets, the
    Company’s return is in the form of tax credits which are
    guaranteed by a creditworthy third party. For such investments,
    the maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying amounts
    plus any unfunded commitments, reduced by amounts guaranteed by
    third parties.

As described in Note 16, the Company makes commitments to
    fund partnership investments in the normal course of business.
    Excluding these commitments, MetLife did not provide financial
    or other support to investees designated as VIEs during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Interest rate swaps are used by the Company primarily to reduce
    market risks from changes in interest rates and to alter
    interest rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets
    and liabilities (duration mismatches). In an

F-66


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

interest rate swap, the Company agrees with another party to
    exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
    rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by
    reference to an agreed notional principal amount. These
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that
    provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty
    at each due date.

The Company commenced the use of inflation swaps during the
    first quarter of 2008. Inflation swaps are used as an economic
    hedge to reduce inflation risk generated from inflation-indexed
    liabilities. Inflation swaps are included in interest rate swaps
    in the preceding table.

The Company also enters into basis swaps to better match the
    cash flows from assets and related liabilities. In a basis swap,
    both legs of the swap are floating with each based on a
    different index. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset
    of the contract and no principal payments are made by either
    party. A single net payment is usually made by one counterparty
    at each due date. Basis swaps are included in interest rate
    swaps in the preceding table.

Interest rate caps and floors are used by the Company primarily
    to protect its floating rate liabilities against rises in
    interest rates above a specified level, and against interest
    rate exposure arising from mismatches between assets and
    liabilities (duration mismatches), as well as to protect its
    minimum rate guarantee liabilities against declines in interest
    rates below a specified level, respectively.

In exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) and equity
    futures transactions, the Company agrees to purchase or sell a
    specified number of contracts, the value of which is determined
    by the different classes of interest rate and equity securities,
    and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal
    to the difference in the daily market values of those contracts.
    The Company enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated
    futures commission merchants that are members of the exchange.

Exchange-traded interest rate (Treasury and swap) futures are
    used primarily to hedge mismatches between the duration of
    assets in a portfolio and the duration of liabilities supported
    by those assets, to hedge against changes in value of securities
    the Company owns or anticipates acquiring, and to hedge against
    changes in interest rates on anticipated liability issuances by
    replicating Treasury or swap curve performance. The value of
    interest rate futures is substantially impacted by changes in
    interest rates and they can be used to modify or hedge existing
    interest rate risk.

Exchange-traded equity futures are used primarily to hedge
    liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company.

Foreign currency derivatives, including foreign currency swaps,
    foreign currency forwards and currency option contracts, are
    used by the Company to reduce the risk from fluctuations in
    foreign currency exchange rates associated with its assets and
    liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Company also
    uses foreign currency forwards and swaps to hedge the foreign
    currency risk associated with certain of its net investments in
    foreign operations.

In a foreign currency swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party to exchange, at specified intervals, the
    difference between one currency and another at a fixed exchange
    rate, generally set at inception, calculated by reference to an
    agreed upon principal amount. The principal amount of each
    currency is exchanged at the inception and termination of the
    currency swap by each party.

In a foreign currency forward transaction, the Company agrees
    with another party to deliver a specified amount of an
    identified currency at a specified future date. The price is
    agreed upon at the time of the contract and payment for such a
    contract is made in a different currency at the specified future
    date.

The Company enters into currency option contracts that give it
    the right, but not the obligation, to sell the foreign currency
    amount in exchange for a functional currency amount within a
    limited time at a contracted price. The contracts may also be
    net settled in cash, based on differentials in the foreign
    exchange rate and the strike price. Currency option contracts
    are included in options in the preceding table.

MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Swaptions are used by the Company to hedge interest rate risk
    associated with the Company’s long-term liabilities, as
    well as to sell, or monetize, embedded call options in its fixed
    rate liabilities. A swaption is an option to enter into a swap
    with an effective date equal to the exercise date of the
    embedded call and a maturity date equal to the maturity date of
    the underlying liability. The Company receives a premium for
    entering into the swaption. Swaptions are included in options in
    the preceding table.

Equity index options are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. To hedge against adverse changes in
    equity indices, the Company enters into contracts to sell the
    equity index options within a limited time at a contracted
    price. The contracts will be net settled in cash based on
    differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the
    strike price. Equity index options are included in options in
    the preceding table.

The Company enters into financial forwards to buy and sell
    securities. The price is agreed upon at the time of the contract
    and payment for such a contract is made at a specified future
    date. In connection with the acquisition of a residential
    mortgage origination and servicing business in the third quarter
    of 2008, the Company acquired, as well as commenced issuing,
    interest rate lock commitments and financial forwards to sell
    residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company uses
    financial forwards to sell securities as economic hedges against
    the risk of changes in the estimated fair value of mortgage
    loans held-for-sale and interest rate lock commitments. Interest
    rate lock commitments are short-term commitments to fund
    mortgage loan applications in process for a fixed term at a
    fixed price. During the term of an interest rate lock
    commitment, the Company is exposed to the risk that interest
    rates will change from the rate quoted to the potential
    borrower. Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans
    that will be held-for-sale are considered derivatives pursuant
    to SFAS 133. Interest rate lock commitments and financial
    forwards to sell residential mortgage-backed securities are
    included in financial forwards in the preceding table.

Equity variance swaps are used by the Company primarily to hedge
    minimum guarantees embedded in certain variable annuity products
    offered by the Company. In an equity variance swap, the Company
    agrees with another party to exchange amounts in the future,
    based on changes in equity volatility over a defined period.
    Equity variance swaps are included in financial forwards in the
    preceding table.

Swap spread locks are used by the Company to hedge invested
    assets on an economic basis against the risk of changes in
    credit spreads. Swap spread locks are forward transactions
    between two parties whose underlying reference index is a
    forward starting interest rate swap where the Company agrees to
    pay a coupon based on a predetermined reference swap spread in
    exchange for receiving a coupon based on a floating rate. The
    Company has the option to cash settle with the counterparty in
    lieu of maintaining the swap after the effective date. Swap
    spread locks are included in financial forwards in the preceding
    table.

Certain credit default swaps are used by the Company to hedge
    against credit-related changes in the value of its investments
    and to diversify its credit risk exposure in certain portfolios.
    In a credit default swap transaction, the Company agrees with
    another party, at specified intervals, to pay a premium to
    insure credit risk. If a credit event, as defined by the
    contract, occurs, generally the contract will require the swap
    to be settled gross by the delivery of par quantities of the
    referenced investment equal to the specified swap notional in
    exchange for the payment of cash amounts by the counterparty
    equal to the par value of the investment surrendered.

Credit default swaps are also used to synthetically create
    investments that are either more expensive to acquire or
    otherwise unavailable in the cash markets. These transactions
    are a combination of a derivative and a cash instrument such as
    a U.S. Treasury or Agency security. The Company also enters
    into certain credit default swaps held in relation to trading
    portfolios.

A synthetic guaranteed interest contract (“GIC”) is a
    contract that simulates the performance of a traditional GIC
    through the use of financial instruments. Under a synthetic GIC,
    the policyholder owns the underlying assets. The Company
    guarantees a rate return on those assets for a premium.

MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Total rate of return swaps (“TRRs”) are swaps whereby
    the Company agrees with another party to exchange, at specified
    intervals, the difference between the economic risk and reward
    of an asset or a market index and LIBOR, calculated by reference
    to an agreed notional principal amount. No cash is exchanged at
    the outset of the contract. Cash is paid and received over the
    life of the contract based on the terms of the swap. These
    transactions are entered into pursuant to master agreements that
    provide for a single net payment to be made by the counterparty
    at each due date. TRRs can be used as hedges or to synthetically
    create investments and are included in the other classification
    in the preceding table.

All components of each derivative’s gain or loss were

    accounting due to a hedged firm commitment no longer qualifying
    as a fair value hedge.

Cash
    Flow Hedges

The Company designates and accounts for the following as cash
    flow hedges when they have met the requirements of
    SFAS 133: (i) interest rate swaps to convert floating
    rate investments to fixed rate investments; (ii) interest
    rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate
    liabilities; and (iii) foreign currency swaps to hedge the
    foreign currency cash flow exposure of foreign currency
    denominated investments and liabilities.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the
    Company did not recognize any net investment gains (losses)
    which represented the ineffective portion of all cash flow
    hedges. All components of each derivative’s gain or loss
    were included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In
    certain instances, the Company discontinued cash flow hedge
    accounting because the forecasted transactions did not occur on
    the anticipated date or in the additional time period permitted
    by SFAS 133. The net amounts reclassified into net
    investment losses for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006 related to such discontinued cash flow hedges were
    $12 million, $3 million and $3 million,
    respectively. There were no hedged forecasted transactions,
    other than the receipt or payment of variable interest payments
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Hedges
    of Net Investments in Foreign Operations

The Company uses forward exchange contracts, foreign currency
    swaps, options and non-derivative financial instruments to hedge
    portions of its net investments in foreign operations against
    adverse movements in exchange rates. The Company measures
    ineffectiveness on the forward exchange contracts based upon the
    change in forward rates. There was no ineffectiveness recorded
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Company’s consolidated statement of stockholders’
    equity for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    include gains (losses) of $495 million, ($180) million
    and ($17) million, respectively, related to foreign
    currency contracts and non-derivative financial instruments used
    to hedge its net investments in foreign operations. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the cumulative foreign currency
    translation gain (loss) recorded in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) related to these hedges was
    $126 million and ($369) million, respectively. When
    net investments in foreign operations are sold or substantially
    liquidated, the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) are reclassified to the consolidated statements of
    income, while a pro rata portion will be reclassified upon
    partial sale of the net investments in foreign operations.

Non-qualifying
    Derivatives and Derivatives for Purposes Other Than
    Hedging

The Company enters into the following derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133 or for purposes
    other than hedging: (i) interest rate swaps, purchased caps
    and floors, and interest rate futures to economically hedge its
    exposure to interest rates; (ii) foreign currency forwards,
    swaps and option contracts to economically hedge its exposure to
    adverse movements in exchange rates; (iii) credit default
    swaps to economically hedge exposure to adverse movements in
    credit; (iv) equity futures, equity index options, interest
    rate futures and equity variance swaps to economically hedge
    liabilities embedded in certain variable annuity products;
    (v) swap spread locks to economically hedge invested assets
    against the risk of changes in credit spreads;
    (vi) financial forwards to buy and sell securities to
    economically hedge its exposure to interest rates;
    (vii) synthetic guaranteed interest contracts;
    (viii) credit default swaps and total rate of return swaps
    to synthetically create investments; (ix) basis swaps to
    better match the cash flows of assets and related liabilities;
    (x) credit default swaps held in relation to trading

Embedded
    Derivatives

The Company has certain embedded derivatives that are required
    to be separated from their host contracts and accounted for as
    derivatives. These host contracts principally include: variable
    annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal, guaranteed minimum
    accumulation and certain guaranteed minimum income riders; ceded
    reinsurance contracts related to guaranteed minimum accumulation
    and certain guaranteed minimum income riders; and guaranteed
    investment contracts with equity or bond indexed crediting rates.

Effective January 1, 2008, upon adoption of SFAS 157,
    the valuation of the Company’s guaranteed minimum benefit
    riders includes an adjustment for the Company’s own credit.
    Included in net investment gains (losses) for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 are gains of $2,994 million in
    connection with this adjustment.

Credit
    Risk

The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event
    of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial
    instruments. Generally, the current credit exposure of the
    Company’s derivative contracts is limited to the net
    positive estimated fair value of derivative contracts at the
    reporting date after taking into consideration the existence of
    netting agreements and any collateral received pursuant to
    credit support annexes.

The Company manages its credit risk related to over-the-counter
    derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy
    counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through
    the use of master agreements that provide for a single net
    payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due
    date and upon termination. Because exchange traded futures are
    effected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked
    to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to such derivative instruments. See Note 24
    for a description of the impact of credit risk on the valuation
    of derivative instruments.

The Company enters into various collateral arrangements, which
    require both the pledging and accepting of collateral in
    connection with its derivative instruments. At December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the Company was

F-72

obligated to return cash collateral under its control of
    $7,758 million and $833 million, respectively. This
    unrestricted cash collateral is included in cash and cash
    equivalents or in short-term investments and the obligation to
    return it is included in payables for collateral under
    securities loaned and other transactions in the consolidated
    balance sheets. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    had also accepted collateral consisting of various securities
    with a fair market value of $1,249 million and
    $678 million, respectively, which are held in separate
    custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell
    or repledge this collateral, but at December 31, 2008, none
    of the collateral had been sold or repledged.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company provided
    securities collateral for various arrangements in connection
    with derivative instruments of $776 million and
    $162 million, respectively, which is included in fixed
    maturity securities. The counterparties are permitted by
    contract to sell or repledge this collateral. In addition, the
    Company has exchange-traded futures, which require the pledging
    of collateral. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    pledged securities collateral for exchange-traded futures of
    $282 million and $167 million, respectively, which is
    included in fixed maturity securities. The counterparties are
    permitted by contract to sell or repledge this collateral. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company provided cash
    collateral for exchange-traded futures of $686 million and
    $102 million, respectively, which is included in premiums
    and other receivables.

In connection with synthetically created investment transactions
    and credit default swaps held in relation to the trading
    portfolio, the Company writes credit default swaps for which it
    receives a premium to insure credit risk. If a credit event, as
    defined by the contract, occurs generally the contract will
    require the Company to pay the counterparty the specified swap
    notional amount in exchange for the delivery of par quantities
    of the referenced credit obligation. The Company’s maximum
    amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced credit
    obligations is zero, was $1,875 million at
    December 31, 2008. The Company can terminate these
    contracts at any time through cash settlement with the
    counterparty at an amount equal to the then current fair value
    of the credit default swaps. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company would have paid $37 million to terminate all of
    these contracts.

The Company has also entered into credit default swaps to
    purchase credit protection on certain of the referenced credit
    obligations in the table below. As a result, the maximum amount
    of potential future recoveries available to offset the
    $1,875 million from the table below was $13 million at
    December 31, 2008.

Other goodwill has been attributed to the Individual and
    Institutional segment reporting units. The Individual segment
    was attributed $210 million, (traditional life —
    $23 million, variable & universal
    life — $11 million and annuities —
    $176 million) and the Institutional segment was attributed
    $195 million, (group life — $2 million,
    retirement & savings — $186 million,
    and non-medical health & other —
    $7 million) at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

As described in more detail in Note 1, the Company
    performed its annual goodwill impairment tests during the third
    quarter of 2008 based upon data as of June 30, 2008. Such
    tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired as of
    September 30, 2008. Current economic conditions, the
    sustained low level of equity markets, declining market
    capitalizations in the insurance industry and lower operating
    earnings projections, particularly for the Individual segment,
    required management of the Company to consider the impact of
    these events on the recoverability of its assets, in particular
    its goodwill. Management concluded it was appropriate to perform
    an interim goodwill impairment test at December 31, 2008.
    Based upon the tests performed management concluded no
    impairment of goodwill had occurred for any of the
    Company’s reporting units at December 31, 2008.

Management continues to evaluate current market conditions that
    may affect the estimated fair value of the Company’s
    reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment
    exists. Continued deteriorating or adverse market conditions for
    certain reporting units may have a significant impact on the
    estimated fair value of these reporting units and could result
    in future impairments of goodwill.

Separate
    Accounts

Separate account assets and liabilities include two categories
    of account types: pass-through separate accounts totaling
    $96.6 billion and $141.7 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, for which the policyholder assumes
    all investment risk, and separate accounts with a minimum return
    or account value for which the Company contractually guarantees
    either a minimum return or account value to the policyholder
    which totaled $24.2 billion and $18.4 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The latter
    category consisted primarily of Met Managed GICs and
    participating close-out contracts. The average interest rate
    credited on these contracts was 4.40% and 4.73% at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Fees charged to the separate accounts by the Company (including
    mortality charges, policy administration fees and surrender
    charges) are reflected in the Company’s revenues as
    universal life and investment-type product policy fees and
    totaled $3.2 billion, $2.8 billion and
    $2.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company’s proportional interest in separate accounts is

    the general account to the separate accounts.

Obligations
    Under Guaranteed Interest Contract Program

The Company issues fixed and floating rate obligations under its
    GIC program which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or
    foreign currencies. During the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued $5.8 billion,
    $5.2 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, and
    repaid $8.3 billion, $4.3 billion and
    $2.6 billion, respectively, of GICs under this program. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, GICs outstanding, which are
    included in policyholder account balances, were
    $21.6 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively. During
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, interest
    credited on the contracts, which are included in interest
    credited to policyholder account balances, was
    $1.0 billion, $1.1 billion and $834 million,
    respectively.

Obligations
    Under Funding Agreements

MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut is a member of the FHLB
    of Boston and holds $70 million of common stock of the FHLB
    of Boston at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, which is
    included in equity securities. MICC has also entered into
    funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston whereby MICC has
    issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and for
    which the FHLB of Boston has been granted a blanket lien on
    certain MICC assets, including residential mortgage-backed
    securities, to collateralize MICC’s obligations under the
    funding agreements. MICC maintains control over these pledged
    assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any
    portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of
    default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to
    satisfy the collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of
    default by MICC, the FHLB of Boston’s recovery on the
    collateral is limited to the amount of MICC’s liability to
    the FHLB of Boston. The amount of MICC’s liability for
    funding agreements with the FHLB of Boston was $526 million
    and $726 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, which is included in policyholder account
    balances. In addition, at December 31, 2008, MICC had
    advances of $300 million from the FHLB of Boston with
    original maturities of less than one year and therefore, such
    advances are included in short-term debt. These advances and the
    advances on these funding agreements are collateralized by
    mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $1.3 billion and $901 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is a member of the FHLB of
    NY and holds $830 million and $339 million of common
    stock of the FHLB of NY at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, which is included in equity securities. MLIC has
    also entered into funding agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby
    MLIC has issued such funding agreements in exchange for cash and
    for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a lien on certain MLIC
    assets, including residential mortgage-backed securities to
    collateralize MLIC’s obligations under the funding
    agreements. MLIC maintains control over these pledged assets,
    and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of
    the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the
    remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the
    collateral maintenance level. Upon any event of default by MLIC,
    the FHLB of NY’s recovery on the collateral is limited to
    the amount of MLIC’s liability to the FHLB of NY. The
    amount of the Company’s liability for funding agreements
    with the FHLB of NY was $15.2 billion and $4.6 billion
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is
    included in policyholder account balances. The advances on these
    agreements are collateralized by mortgage-backed securities with
    estimated fair values of $17.8 billion and
    $4.8 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

MLIC has issued funding agreements to certain trusts that have
    issued securities guaranteed as to payment of interest and
    principal by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, a
    federally chartered instrumentality of the United States. The
    obligations under these funding agreements are secured by a
    pledge of certain eligible agricultural real estate mortgage
    loans and may, under certain circumstances, be secured by other
    qualified collateral. The amount of the Company’s liability
    for funding agreements issued to such trusts was
    $2.5 billion at both December 31, 2008 and 2007, which
    is included in policyholder account balances. The obligations
    under these

funding agreements are collateralized by designated agricultural
    real estate mortgage loans with estimated fair values of
    $2.9 billion at both December 31, 2008 and 2007.

Approximately $3.0 billion of the obligations outstanding
    at MLIC at December 31, 2008 are subject to a temporary
    contingent increase in MLIC’s borrowing capacity which is
    scheduled to expire at December 31, 2009. The Company does
    not expect to have any difficulties in meeting the contingencies
    associated with the increased capacity.

During 2008, 2007 and 2006, as a result of changes in estimates
    of insured events in the respective prior year, claims and claim
    adjustment expenses associated with prior years decreased by
    $353 million, $325 million and $329 million,
    respectively, due to a reduction in prior year automobile bodily
    injury and homeowners’ severity, reduced loss adjustment
    expenses, improved loss ratio for non-medical health claim
    liabilities and improved claim management.

Guarantees

The Company issues annuity contracts which may include
    contractual guarantees to the contractholder for:
    (i) return of no less than total deposits made to the
    contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net
    deposits”); and (ii) the highest contract value on a
    specified anniversary date minus any withdrawals following the
    contract anniversary, or total deposits made to the contract
    less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return
    (“anniversary contract value” or “minimum
    return”). The Company also issues annuity contracts that
    apply a lower rate of funds deposited if the contractholder

Reinsurance

The Company’s Individual segment life insurance operations
    participate in reinsurance activities in order to limit losses,
    minimize exposure to large risks, and provide additional
    capacity for future growth. The Company has historically
    reinsured the mortality risk on new individual life insurance
    policies primarily on an excess of retention basis or a quota
    share basis. Until 2005, the Company reinsured up to 90% of the
    mortality risk for all new individual life insurance policies
    that it wrote through its various franchises. This practice was
    initiated by the different franchises for different products
    starting at various points in time between 1992 and 2000. During
    2005, the Company changed its retention practices for certain
    individual life insurance. Amounts reinsured in prior years
    remain reinsured under the original reinsurance; however, under
    the new retention guidelines, the Company reinsures up to 90% of
    the mortality risk in excess of $1 million for most new
    individual life insurance policies that it writes through its
    various franchises and for certain individual life policies the
    retention limits remained unchanged. On a case by case basis,
    the Company may retain up to $20 million per life and
    reinsure 100% of amounts in excess of the Company’s
    retention limits. The Company evaluates its reinsurance programs
    routinely and may increase or decrease its retention at any
    time. In addition, the Company reinsures a significant portion
    of the mortality risk on its

F-83


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

individual universal life policies issued since 1983. Placement
    of reinsurance is done primarily on an automatic basis and also
    on a facultative basis for risks with specific characteristics.

The Company’s Individual segment also reinsures a portion
    of the living and death benefit riders issued in connection with
    its variable annuities. Under these reinsurance agreements, the
    Company pays a reinsurance premium generally based on rider fees
    collected from policyholders and receives reimbursements for
    benefits paid or accrued in excess of account values, subject to
    certain limitations. The Company enters into similar agreements
    for new or in-force business depending on market conditions.

The Institutional segment generally retains most of its risks
    and does not significantly utilize reinsurance. The Company may,
    on certain client arrangements, cede particular risks to
    reinsurers.

The Auto & Home segment purchases reinsurance to
    control its exposure to large losses (primarily catastrophe
    losses) and to protect statutory surplus. Auto & Home
    cedes to reinsurers a portion of losses and cedes premiums based
    upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to
    reinsurance. To control exposure to large property and casualty
    losses, Auto & Home utilizes property catastrophe,
    casualty, and property per risk excess of loss agreements.

The Company also reinsures through 100% quota-share reinsurance
    agreements certain long-term care and workers’ compensation
    business written by MICC prior to the Company’s acquisition
    of MICC. These run-off businesses have been included within
    Corporate & Other since the acquisition of MICC.

In addition to reinsuring mortality risk as described
    previously, the Company reinsures other risks, as well as
    specific coverages. The Company routinely reinsures certain
    classes of risks in order to limit its exposure to particular
    travel, avocation and lifestyle hazards. The Company has
    exposure to catastrophes, which could contribute to significant
    fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations. The
    Company uses excess of retention and quota share reinsurance
    arrangements to provide greater diversification of risk and
    minimize exposure to larger risks.

The Company reinsures its business through a diversified group
    of reinsurers. In the event that reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations to the Company under the terms of the reinsurance
    agreements, reinsurance balances recoverable could become
    uncollectible. Cessions under reinsurance arrangements do not
    discharge the Company’s obligations as the primary insurer.

Reinsurance recoverable balances are stated net of allowances
    for uncollectible balances, which are immaterial. The Company
    evaluates the financial strength of the Company’s
    reinsurers by monitoring their ratings and analyzing their
    financial statements. The Company also analyzes recent trends in
    arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes, if any, with
    its reinsurers. Recoverability of reinsurance recoverable
    balances are evaluated based on these analyses.

Included in the reinsurance recoverables are, $1.2 billion
    at both December 31, 2008 and 2007 related to reinsurance
    of long-term GICs and structured settlement lump sum contracts
    accounted for as a financing transaction; $3.9 billion and
    $3.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, related to reinsurance recoverable on the run-off
    of long-term care business originally written by MICC;
    $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, related to reinsurance recoverable
    on the run-off of workers compensation business originally
    written by MICC; and $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion at

and 2007, respectively, related to the reinsurance of
    investment-type contracts held by small market defined benefit
    contribution plans.

The Company has secured certain reinsurance recoverable balances
    with various forms of collateral, including secured trusts,
    funds withheld accounts and irrevocable letters of credit. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company has $5,489 million of
    reinsurance recoverable balances secured by funds held in trust
    as collateral, $524 million of reinsurance recoverable
    balances secured by funds withheld accounts and
    $286 million of reinsurance recoverable balances secured
    through irrevocable letters of credit issued by various
    financial institutions.

At December 31, 2008, $7,651 million, or 69%, of the
    Company’s total reinsurance recoverable balances were due
    from its five largest reinsurers. Of these reinsurance
    recoverable balances, $5,194 million were secured by funds
    held in trust as collateral and $209 million were secured
    through irrevocable letters of credit issued by various
    financial institutions.

Reinsurance balances payable, included in other liabilities,
    were $1,405 million and $571 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Closed
    Block

On April 7, 2000, (the “Demutualization Date”),
    MLIC converted from a mutual life insurance company to a stock
    life insurance company and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    MetLife, Inc. The conversion was pursuant to an order by the New
    York Superintendent of Insurance (the
    “Superintendent”) approving MLIC’s plan of
    reorganization, as amended (the “Plan”). On the
    Demutualization Date, MLIC established a closed block for the
    benefit of holders of certain individual life insurance policies
    of MLIC. Assets have been allocated to the closed block in an
    amount that has been determined to produce cash flows which,
    together with anticipated revenues from the policies included in
    the closed block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to
    support obligations and liabilities relating to these policies,
    including, but not limited to, provisions for the payment of
    claims and certain expenses and taxes, and to provide for the
    continuation of policyholder dividend scales in effect for 1999,
    if the experience underlying such dividend scales continues, and
    for appropriate adjustments in such scales if the experience
    changes. At least annually, the Company compares actual and
    projected experience against the experience assumed in the
    then-current dividend scales. Dividend scales are adjusted
    periodically to give effect to changes in experience.

The closed block assets, the cash flows generated by the closed
    block assets and the anticipated revenues from the policies in
    the closed block will benefit only the holders of the policies
    in the closed block. To the extent that, over time, cash flows
    from the assets allocated to the closed block and claims and
    other experience related to the closed block are, in the
    aggregate, more or less favorable than what was assumed when the
    closed block was established, total dividends paid to closed
    block policyholders in the future may be greater than or less
    than the total dividends that would have been paid to these
    policyholders if the policyholder dividend scales in effect for
    1999 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts
    assumed will be available for distribution over time to closed
    block policyholders and will not be available to stockholders.
    If the closed block has insufficient funds to make guaranteed
    policy benefit payments, such payments will be made from assets
    outside of the closed block. The closed block will continue in
    effect as long as any policy in the closed block remains
    in-force. The expected life of the closed block is over
    100 years.

The Company uses the same accounting principles to account for
    the participating policies included in the closed block as it
    used prior to the Demutualization Date. However, the Company
    establishes a policyholder dividend obligation for earnings that
    will be paid to policyholders as additional dividends as
    described below. The excess of closed block liabilities over
    closed block assets at the effective date of the demutualization
    (adjusted to eliminate the impact of related amounts in
    accumulated other comprehensive income) represents the estimated
    maximum future earnings from the closed block expected to result
    from operations attributed to the closed block after income
    taxes. Earnings of the closed block are recognized in income
    over the period the policies and contracts

F-86


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

in the closed block remain in-force. Management believes that
    over time the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block
    will approximately equal the expected cumulative earnings due to
    the effect of dividend changes. If, over the period the closed
    block remains in existence, the actual cumulative earnings of
    the closed block is greater than the expected cumulative
    earnings of the closed block, the Company will pay the excess of
    the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block over the
    expected cumulative earnings to closed block policyholders as
    additional policyholder dividends unless offset by future
    unfavorable experience of the closed block and, accordingly,
    will recognize only the expected cumulative earnings in income
    with the excess recorded as a policyholder dividend obligation.
    If over such period, the actual cumulative earnings of the
    closed block is less than the expected cumulative earnings of
    the closed block, the Company will recognize only the actual
    earnings in income. However, the Company may change policyholder
    dividend scales in the future, which would be intended to
    increase future actual earnings until the actual cumulative
    earnings equal the expected cumulative earnings.

Recent experience within the closed block, in particular
    mortality and investment yields, as well as realized and
    unrealized losses, has resulted in a reduction of the
    policyholder dividend obligation to zero during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The reduction of the policyholder
    dividend obligation to zero and the Company’s decision to
    revise the expected policyholder dividend scales, which are
    based upon statutory results, has resulted in reduction to both
    actual and expected cumulative earnings of the closed block.
    This change in the timing of the expected cumulative earnings of
    the closed block combined with a policyholder dividend
    obligation of zero has resulted in a reduction in the DAC
    associated with closed block, which resides outside of the
    closed block, and a corresponding decrease in the Company’s
    net income of $127 million, net of income tax, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. Amortization of the closed block
    DAC will be based upon actual cumulative earnings rather than
    expected cumulative earnings of the closed block until such time
    as the actual cumulative earnings of the closed block exceed the
    expected cumulative earnings, at which time the policyholder
    dividend obligation will be reestablished. Actual cumulative
    earnings less than expected cumulative earnings will result in
    future reductions to DAC and net income of the Company and
    increase sensitivity of the Company’s net income to
    movements in closed block results. See also Note 5 for
    further information regarding DAC.

    unsecured senior debt which consists of senior notes, fixed rate
    notes and other notes with varying interest rates, followed by
    subordinated debt which consists of junior subordinated
    debentures. Payments of interest and principal on the
    Company’s surplus notes, which are subordinate to all other
    obligations at the operating company level and senior to
    obligations at the Holding Company, may be made only with the
    prior approval of the insurance department of the state of
    domicile. Collateral financing arrangements are supported by
    either surplus notes of subsidiaries or financing arrangements
    with the Holding Company and accordingly have priority
    consistent with other such obligations.

Long-term debt, credit facilities and letters of credit of the
    Holding Company and its subsidiaries contain various covenants.
    The Company has certain administrative, reporting, legal and
    financial covenants, including one requiring the Company to
    maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth. The Company
    amended certain of its credit facilities, including its

included in equity securities. MetLife Bank has also entered
    into repurchase agreements with the FHLB of NY whereby MetLife
    Bank has issued repurchase agreements in exchange for cash and
    for which the FHLB of NY has been granted a blanket lien on
    certain of MetLife Bank’s residential mortgages, mortgage
    loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed
    securities to collateralize MetLife Bank’s obligations
    under the repurchase agreements. MetLife Bank maintains control
    over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or
    dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no
    event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is
    sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The
    repurchase agreements and the related security agreement
    represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of
    default by MetLife Bank, the FHLB of NY’s recovery is
    limited to the amount of MetLife Bank’s liability under the
    outstanding repurchase agreements. The amount of MetLife
    Bank’s liability for repurchase agreements with the FHLB of
    NY was $1.8 billion and $1.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which is included
    in long-term debt and short-term debt depending upon the
    original tenor of the advance. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, MetLife Bank received
    advances related to long-term borrowings totaling
    $220 million, $390 million and $260 million,
    respectively, from the FHLB of NY. MetLife Bank made repayments
    to the FHLB of NY of $371 million, $175 million and
    $117 million related to long-term borrowings for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    advances on these repurchase agreements related to both
    long-term and short-term debt are collateralized by residential
    mortgages, mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial mortgages
    and mortgage-backed securities with estimated fair values of
    $3.1 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Collateralized
    Borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York

MetLife Bank is a depository institution that is approved to use
    the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Discount Window borrowing
    privileges and participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of New
    York Term Auction Facility (“TAF”). In order to
    utilize these facilities, since September 2008 MetLife Bank has
    pledged qualifying loans and investment securities to the
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York as collateral. Starting in
    October 2008, MetLife Bank has participated in periodic TAF
    auctions, which have a maximum maturity of 84 days. At
    December 31, 2008, MetLife Bank’s liability for
    advances from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was
    $950 million, which is included in short-term debt. The
    estimated fair value of loan and investment security collateral
    pledged by MetLife Bank to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
    at December 31, 2008 was $1.6 billion. For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate
    on the TAF advances was 0.8% and the average daily balance was
    $145 million. TAF advances were outstanding for an average
    of 41 days during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Short-term
    Debt

Short-term debt was $2,659 million and $667 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, short-term debt consisted of
    $714 million of commercial paper, $950 million related
    to the aforementioned collateralized borrowing from the Federal
    Reserve Bank of New York, $695 million related to MetLife
    Bank’s liability under the aforementioned repurchase
    agreements with the FHLB of NY with original maturities of less
    than one year and $300 million related to MICC’s
    liability for borrowings from the FHLB of Boston with original
    maturities of less than one year. Short-term debt at
    December 31, 2007 consisted entirely of commercial paper.
    During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    the weighted average interest rate on short-term debt was 2.4%,
    5.0% and 5.2%, respectively. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the average daily balance
    of short-term debt was $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion and

Credit
    and Committed Facilities and Letters of Credit

Credit Facilities.

The Company maintains
    committed and unsecured credit facilities aggregating
    $3.2 billion at December 31, 2008. When drawn upon,
    these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance
    with the respective agreements as specified below. The
    facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, at
    December 31, 2008, $2.9 billion of the facilities also
    served as

back-up

lines of credit for the Company’s commercial paper
    programs. These agreements contain various administrative,
    reporting, legal and financial covenants, including one
    requiring the Company to maintain a specified minimum
    consolidated net worth. Management has no reason to believe that
    its lending counterparties are unable to fulfill their
    respective contractual obligations.

Total fees associated with these credit facilities were
    $17 million, of which $11 million related to deferred
    amendment fees, for the year ended December 31, 2008.

In December 2008, the Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc.
    entered into an amended and restated $2.85 billion credit
    agreement with various financial institutions. The agreement
    amended and restated the $3.0 billion credit agreement
    entered into in June 2007. Proceeds are available to be used for
    general corporate purposes, to support their commercial paper
    programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. All
    borrowings under the credit agreement must be repaid by June
    2012, except that letters of credit outstanding upon termination
    may remain outstanding until June 2013. The borrowers and the
    lenders under this facility may agree to extend the term of all
    or part of the facility to no later than June 2014, except that
    letters of credit outstanding upon termination may remain
    outstanding until June 2015. Fees for this agreement include a
    0.25% facility fee, 0.075% fronting fee, a letter of credit fee
    between 1% and 5% based on certain market rates and a 0.05%
    utilization fee, as applicable, and may vary based on MetLife,
    Inc.’s senior unsecured ratings. The Holding Company and
    MetLife Funding, Inc. incurred amendment costs of
    $11 million related to the $2,850 million amended and
    restated credit agreement, which have been capitalized and
    included in other assets. These costs will be amortized over the
    term of the agreement. The Holding Company did not have any
    deferred financing costs associated with the original June 2007
    credit agreement.

In July 2008, the facility was increased by $100 million
    and its maturity extended for one year to July 2009. Fees for
    this agreement include a commitment fee of $10,000 and a margin
    of Federal Funds plus 0.11%, as applicable.

Committed Facilities.

The Company maintains
    committed facilities aggregating $11.5 billion at
    December 31, 2008. When drawn upon, these facilities bear
    interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective
    agreements as specified below. The facilities are used for
    collateral for certain of the Company’s reinsurance
    reserves. These facilities contain various administrative,
    reporting, legal and financial covenants, including one
    requiring the Company to maintain a specified minimum
    consolidated net worth. Management has no reason to believe that
    its lending counterparties are unable to fulfill their

Vermont (“MRV”). To collateralize its reinsurance
    obligations, MRV and the Holding Company entered into a

30-year,

$2.9 billion letter of credit facility with an unaffiliated

In September 2008, MRV and the Holding Company entered into a

30-year,

$3.5 billion letter of credit facility with an unaffiliated
    financial institution. These letters of credit serve as
    collateral for MRV’s obligations under a reinsurance
    agreement.

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2008,
    the Company had outstanding $6.6 billion in letters of
    credit from various financial institutions of which
    $4.3 billion and $2.3 billion, were part of committed
    and credit facilities, respectively. As commitments associated
    with letters of credit and financing arrangements may expire
    unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect the
    Company’s actual future cash funding requirements.

Collateral
    Financing Arrangements

Associated
    with the Closed Block

In December 2007, MLIC reinsured a portion of its closed block
    liabilities to MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston
    (“MRC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In
    connection with this transaction, MRC issued, to investors
    placed by an unaffiliated financial institution,
    $2.5 billion of

35-year

surplus notes to provide statutory reserve support for the
    assumed closed block liabilities. Interest on the surplus notes
    accrues at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55%, payable quarterly. The ability of MRC to make
    interest and principal payments on the surplus notes is
    contingent upon South Carolina regulatory approval. At both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, surplus notes outstanding were
    $2.5 billion.

Simultaneous with the issuance of the surplus notes, the Holding
    Company entered into an agreement with the unaffiliated
    financial institution, under which the Holding Company is
    entitled to the interest paid by MRC on the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly on such amount as adjusted,
    as described below. Under this agreement, the Holding Company
    may also be required to pledge collateral or make payments to
    the unaffiliated financial institution related to any decline in
    the estimated fair value of the surplus notes. Any such payments
    would be accounted for as a receivable and included under other
    assets on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
    and would not reduce the principal amount outstanding of the
    surplus notes. In addition, the Holding Company may also be
    required to make a payment to the unaffiliated financial
    institution in connection with any early termination of this
    agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    Holding Company paid $800 million to the unaffiliated
    financial institution related to a decline in the estimated fair
    value of the surplus notes. This payment reduced the amount
    under the agreement on which the Holding Company’s interest
    payment is due but did not reduce the outstanding amount of the
    surplus notes. In addition, the Holding Company had pledged
    collateral of $230 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution at December 31, 2008. No collateral had been
    pledged at December 31, 2007.

A majority of the proceeds from the offering of the surplus
    notes were placed in trust, which is consolidated by the
    Company, to support MRC’s statutory obligations associated
    with the assumed closed block liabilities.

During 2007 and 2008 the Company deposited $2.0 billion and
    $314 million, respectively, into the trust, from the
    proceeds of surplus notes issued in 2007. At December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the estimated fair value of assets held in trust
    by the Company was $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion,
    respectively. The assets are principally invested in fixed
    maturity securities and are presented as such within the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with the related
    income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated income statement. Interest on the
    collateral financing arrangement is included as a component of
    other expenses.

Total interest expense was $117 million and $5 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Associated
    with Secondary Guarantees

In May 2007, the Holding Company and MetLife Reinsurance Company
    of South Carolina, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
    entered into a

30-year

collateral financing arrangement with an unaffiliated financial
    institution that provides up to $3.5 billion of statutory
    reserve support for MRSC associated with reinsurance obligations
    under intercompany reinsurance agreements. Such statutory
    reserves are associated with universal life secondary guarantees
    and are required under U.S. Valuation of Life Policies
    Model Regulation (commonly referred to as

Regulation A-XXX).

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $2.7 billion and
    $2.4 billion, respectively, had been drawn upon under the
    collateral financing arrangement. The collateral financing
    arrangement may be extended by agreement of the Holding Company
    and the unaffiliated financial institution on each anniversary
    of the closing.

Proceeds from the collateral financing arrangement were placed
    in trust to support MRSC’s statutory obligations associated
    with the reinsurance of secondary guarantees. The trust is a VIE
    which is consolidated by the Company. The unaffiliated financial
    institution is entitled to the return on the investment
    portfolio held by the trust.

In connection with the collateral financing arrangement, the
    Holding Company entered into an agreement with the same
    unaffiliated financial institution under which the Holding
    Company is entitled to the return on the investment portfolio
    held by the trust established in connection with this collateral
    financing arrangement in exchange for the payment of a stated
    rate of return to the unaffiliated financial institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may
    also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trust, as
    well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination
    of the collateral financing arrangement. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company paid
    $320 million to the unaffiliated financial institution as a
    result of the decline in the estimated fair value of the assets
    in the trust. All of the $320 million was deposited into
    the trust. In January 2009, the Holding Company paid an
    additional $360 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution as a result of the continued decline in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in trust which was also
    deposited into the trust.

In addition, the Holding Company may be required to pledge
    collateral to the unaffiliated financial institution under this
    agreement. At December 31, 2008, the Holding Company had
    pledged $86 million under the agreement. No collateral had
    been pledged under the agreement at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company held assets in
    trust with a estimated fair value of $2.4 billion and
    $2.3 billion, respectively, associated with this
    transaction. The assets are principally invested in fixed
    maturity securities and are presented as such within the
    Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with the related
    income included within net investment income in the
    Company’s consolidated income statement. Interest on the
    collateral financing arrangement is included as a component of
    other expenses.

Transaction costs associated with the collateral financing
    arrangement of $5 million have been capitalized, are
    included in other assets, and are amortized using the effective
    interest method over the period from the issuance of the
    collateral financing arrangement to its expiration. Total
    interest expense was $107 million and $84 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

    $32 million of trust common securities. The trust common
    securities were issued to the Holding Company.

On August 6, 2008, the Series A Trust was dissolved

On February 5, 2009, the Series B Trust was dissolved
    and $32 million of the Series B junior subordinated
    debentures were returned to the Holding Company concurrently
    with the cancellation of the $32 million of trust common
    securities of the Series B Trust held by MetLife, Inc. Upon
    dissolution of the Series B Trust, the remaining
    $1,035 million of Series B junior subordinated
    debentures were distributed to the holders of the trust
    preferred securities and such trust preferred securities were
    cancelled. In connection with the remarketing transaction on
    February 17, 2009, the remaining $1,035 million
    MetLife, Inc. Series B junior subordinated debentures were
    modified, as permitted by their terms, to be 7.717% senior
    debt securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Company did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. See

    underlying the common equity units was $84 million,
    $104 million and $104 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Other
    Junior Subordinated Debentures Issued by the Holding
    Company

In April 2008, MetLife Capital Trust X, a VIE consolidated
    by the Company, issued exchangeable surplus trust securities
    (the “2008 Trust Securities”) with a face amount
    of $750 million. The 2008 Trust Securities will be
    exchanged into a like amount of the Holding Company’s
    junior subordinated debentures on April 8, 2038, the
    scheduled redemption date, mandatorily under certain
    circumstances, and at any time upon the Holding Company
    exercising its option to redeem the securities. The 2008 Trust
    Securities will be exchanged for junior subordinated debentures
    prior to repayment. The final maturity of the debentures is
    April 8, 2068. The Holding Company may cause the redemption
    of the 2008 Trust Securities or debentures (i) in whole or
    in part, at any time on or after April 8, 2033 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to April 8, 2033 at their principal amount
    plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption or,
    if greater, a make-whole price. Interest on the 2008 Trust
    Securities or debentures is payable semi-annually at a fixed
    rate of 9.25% up to, but not including, April 8, 2038, the
    scheduled redemption date. In the event the 2008 Trust
    Securities or debentures are not redeemed on or before the
    scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual
    rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 5.540%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    2008 Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the 2008 Trust
    Securities, the Holding Company entered into a replacement
    capital covenant (“RCC”). As a part of the RCC, the
    Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or
    purchase the debentures on or before April 8, 2058, unless,
    subject to certain limitations, it has received proceeds from
    the sale of specified capital securities. The RCC will terminate
    upon the occurrence of certain events, including an acceleration
    of the debentures due to the occurrence of an event of default.
    The RCC is not intended for the benefit of holders of the
    debentures and may not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the
    benefit of holders of one or more other designated series of its
    indebtedness (which will initially be its 5.70% senior
    notes due June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered
    into a replacement capital obligation which will commence in
    2038 and under

which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial efforts
    to raise replacement capital through the issuance of certain
    qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated with
    the offering of the 2008 Trust Securities of $8 million
    have been capitalized, are included in other assets, and are
    amortized using the effective interest method over the period
    from the issuance date of the 2008 Trust Securities until their
    scheduled redemption. Interest expense on the 2008 Trust
    Securities was $51 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

In December 2007, MetLife Capital Trust IV, a VIE
    consolidated by the Company, issued exchangeable surplus trust
    securities (the “2007 Trust Securities”) with a face
    amount of $700 million and a discount of $6 million
    ($694 million). The 2007 Trust Securities will be exchanged
    into a like amount of Holding Company junior subordinated
    debentures on December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption
    date; mandatorily under certain circumstances; and at any time
    upon the Holding Company exercising its option to redeem the
    securities. The 2007 Trust Securities will be exchanged for
    junior subordinated debentures prior to repayment. The final
    maturity of the debentures is December 15, 2067. The
    Holding Company may cause the redemption of the 2007 Trust
    Securities or debentures (i) in whole or in part, at any
    time on or after December 15, 2032 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances, in whole or
    in part, prior to December 15, 2032 at their principal
    amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest on the
    2007 Trust Securities or debentures is payable semi-annually at
    a fixed rate of 7.875% up to, but not including,
    December 15, 2037, the scheduled redemption date. In the
    event the 2007 Trust Securities or debentures are not redeemed
    on or before the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue
    at an annual rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 3.96%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    2007 Trust Securities or debentures for a period up to ten
    years. Interest compounds during such periods of deferral. If
    interest is deferred for more than five consecutive years, the
    Holding Company may be required to use proceeds from the sale of
    its common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the 2007 Trust
    Securities, the Holding Company entered into a RCC. As a part of
    the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not repay,
    redeem, or purchase the debentures on or before
    December 15, 2057, unless, subject to certain limitations,
    it has received proceeds from the sale of specified capital
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the debentures due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of its indebtedness
    (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered into a
    replacement capital obligation which will commence in 2037 and
    under which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial
    efforts to raise replacement capital through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated
    with the offering of the 2007 Trust Securities of
    $10 million have been capitalized, are included in other
    assets, and are amortized using the effective interest method
    over the period from the issuance date of the 2007 Trust
    Securities until their scheduled redemption. Interest expense on
    the 2007 Trust Securities was $55 million and
    $3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively.

In December 2006, the Holding Company issued junior subordinated
    debentures with a face amount of $1.25 billion. The
    debentures are scheduled for redemption on December 15,
    2036; the final maturity of the debentures is December 15,
    2066. The Holding Company may redeem the debentures (i) in
    whole or in part, at any time on or after December 15, 2031
    at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to
    the date of redemption, or (ii) in certain circumstances,
    in whole or in part, prior to December 15, 2031 at their
    principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
    redemption or, if greater, a make-whole price. Interest is
    payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.40% up to, but not
    including, December 15, 2036, the scheduled redemption
    date. In the event the debentures are not redeemed on or before
    the scheduled redemption date, interest will accrue at an annual
    rate of

3-month

LIBOR plus a margin equal to 2.205%, payable quarterly in
    arrears. The Holding Company has the right to, and in certain
    circumstances the requirement to, defer interest payments on the
    debentures for a period up to ten years. Interest compounds
    during such periods of deferral. If interest is deferred for
    more than five consecutive years, the Holding Company may be
    required to use proceeds from the sale of its

common stock or warrants on common stock to satisfy its
    obligation. In connection with the issuance of the debentures,
    the Holding Company entered into a replacement capital covenant.
    As part of the RCC, the Holding Company agreed that it will not
    repay, redeem, or purchase the debentures on or before
    December 15, 2056, unless, subject to certain limitations,
    it has received proceeds from the sale of specified capital
    securities. The RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of
    certain events, including an acceleration of the debentures due
    to the occurrence of an event of default. The RCC is not
    intended for the benefit of holders of the debentures and may
    not be enforced by them. The RCC is for the benefit of holders
    of one or more other designated series of its indebtedness
    (which will initially be its 5.70% senior notes due
    June 15, 2035). The Holding Company also entered into a
    replacement capital obligation which will commence in 2036 and
    under which the Holding Company must use reasonable commercial
    efforts to raise replacement capital through the issuance of
    certain qualifying capital securities. Issuance costs associated
    with the offering of the debentures of $13 million have
    been capitalized, are included in other assets, and are
    amortized using the effective interest method over the period
    from the issuance date of the debentures until their scheduled
    redemption. Interest expense on the debentures was
    $80 million, $80 million and $2 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Common
    Equity Units

In connection with financing the acquisition of Travelers on
    July 1, 2005, which is described in Note 2, the
    Holding Company distributed and sold 82.8 million 6.375%
    common equity units for $2,070 million in proceeds in a
    registered public offering on June 21, 2005. As described
    below, the common equity units consisted of interests in trust
    preferred securities issued by MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III, and stock purchase contracts issued by the Holding
    Company. The only assets of MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III were junior subordinated debentures issued by the
    Holding Company. As described in Note 12 and in the
    “Remarketing of Junior Subordinated Debentures and
    Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts” section which
    follows, the common equity units ceased to exist upon the
    closing of the remarketing of the underlying debt instruments
    and the settlement of the stock purchase contracts in August
    2008 and February 2009.

Common
    Equity Units

Each common equity unit had an initial stated amount of $25 per
    unit and consisted of: (i) a 1/80 or 1.25% ($12.50),
    undivided beneficial ownership interest in a series A trust
    preferred security of MetLife Capital Trust II
    (“Series A Trust”), with an initial liquidation
    amount of $1,000; (ii) a 1/80 or 1.25% ($12.50), undivided
    beneficial ownership interest in a series B trust preferred
    security of MetLife Capital Trust III (“Series B
    Trust” and, together with the Series A Trust, the
    “Capital Trusts”), with an initial liquidation amount
    of $1,000; and (iii) a stock purchase contract under which
    the holder of the common equity unit agreed to purchase, and the
    Holding Company agreed to sell, on each of the initial stock
    purchase date and the subsequent stock purchase date, a variable
    number of shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, for a purchase price of $12.50. After the
    closing of the first remarketing in August 2008, each common
    equity unit had a stated value of $12.50, rather than the
    initial stated amount of $25 per unit, and no longer included
    any ownership interest in the Series A Trust.

Junior
    Subordinated Debentures Issued to Support Trust Common and
    Preferred Securities

The Holding Company issued $1,067 million 4.82%
    Series A and $1,067 million 4.91% Series B junior
    subordinated debentures due no later than February 15, 2039
    and February 15, 2040, respectively, for a total of
    $2,134 million, in exchange for $2,070 million in
    aggregate proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred
    securities by the Capital Trusts and $64 million in trust
    common securities issued equally by the Capital Trusts. The
    common and preferred securities of the Capital Trusts, totaling
    $2,134 million, represented undivided beneficial ownership
    interests in the assets of the Capital Trusts, had no stated
    maturity and were required to be redeemed upon maturity of the
    corresponding series of junior subordinated
    debentures — the sole assets of the respective Capital
    Trusts. The Series A Trust and Series B Trust made
    quarterly distributions on the common and preferred securities
    when due at

F-98


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

an annual rate of 4.82% and 4.91%, respectively, until they were
    dissolved in August 2008 and February 2009, respectively.

The trust common securities, which were held by the Holding
    Company, represented a 3% interest in the Capital Trusts and
    were reflected as fixed maturity securities in the consolidated
    balance sheet of MetLife, Inc. The Capital Trusts were VIEs in
    accordance with FIN 46(r), and the Company did not
    consolidate its interest in MetLife Capital Trusts II
    and III as it was not the primary beneficiary of either of
    the Capital Trusts.

As described in Note 12, upon dissolution of MetLife
    Capital Trusts II and III, $64 million of the junior
    subordinated debentures were returned to the Holding Company
    concurrently with the cancellation the $64 million of trust
    common securities of MetLife Capital Trust II and III
    held by the Holding Company and the remaining
    $2,070 million of junior subordinated debentures were
    distributed to the holders of the trust preferred securities and
    such trust preferred securities were cancelled.

The Holding Company directly guaranteed the repayment of the
    trust preferred securities to the holders thereof to the extent
    that there were funds available in the Capital Trusts. The
    guarantee remained in place until the full redemption of the
    trust preferred securities. The trust preferred securities held
    by the common equity unit holders were pledged to the Holding
    Company to collateralize the obligation of the common equity
    unit holders under the related stock purchase contracts. The
    common equity unit holders were permitted to substitute certain
    zero coupon treasury securities in place of the trust preferred
    securities, or the junior subordinated debentures subsequent to
    the dissolution of the Capital Trusts, as collateral under the
    stock purchase contract.

The trust preferred securities, or the junior subordinated
    debentures subsequent to the dissolution of the Capital Trusts,
    had remarketing dates which corresponded with the initial and
    subsequent stock purchase dates to provide the holders of the
    common equity units with proceeds to settle the stock purchase
    contracts. The initial stock purchase date was August 15,
    2008, but could have been deferred for quarterly periods until
    February 15, 2009 and the subsequent stock purchase date
    was February 15, 2009 but could have been deferred for
    quarterly periods until February 15, 2010. At the
    respective remarketing dates, the remarketing agent had the
    ability to reset the interest rate on the remarketed securities
    to generate sufficient remarketing proceeds to satisfy the
    common equity unit holder’s obligation under the stock
    purchase contract, subject to a reset cap for each of the first
    two attempted remarketings of each series , which reset cap was
    waived by the Holding Company in connection with the remarketing
    of the Series B debentures in February 2009. The interest
    rate on the supporting junior subordinated debentures issued by
    the Holding Company would have been reset at a commensurate
    rate. If the initial remarketing had been unsuccessful, the
    remarketing agent would have attempted to remarket the trust
    preferred securities or junior subordinated debentures, as
    necessary, in subsequent quarters through February 15, 2009
    for the Series A trust preferred securities or junior
    subordinated debentures and through February 15, 2010 for
    the Series B trust preferred securities or junior
    subordinated debentures. The final attempt at remarketing would
    not have been subject to the reset cap. If all remarketing
    attempts were unsuccessful, the Holding Company had the right,
    as a secured party, to apply the liquidation amount on the trust
    preferred securities to the common equity unit holders’
    obligation under the stock purchase contract and to deliver to
    the common equity unit holder a junior subordinated debt
    security payable on August 15, 2010 at an annual rate of
    4.82% and 4.91% on the Series A and Series B trust
    preferred securities or junior subordinated debentures,
    respectively, in payment of any accrued and unpaid distributions.

Stock
    Purchase Contracts

Each stock purchase contract required the holder of the common
    equity unit to purchase, and the Holding Company to sell, for
    $12.50, on each of the initial stock purchase date and the
    subsequent stock purchase date, a number of newly issued or
    treasury shares of the Holding Company’s common stock, par
    value $0.01 per share, equal to the applicable settlement rate.
    The settlement rate at the respective stock purchase date was
    calculated based on the closing price of the common stock during
    a specified

20-day

period immediately preceding the applicable stock purchase date.
    If the market value of the Holding Company’s common stock
    was less than the

F-99


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

threshold appreciation price of $53.10 but greater than $43.35,
    the reference price, the settlement rate, as adjusted for
    dividends in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase
    contracts, was an amount of the Holding Company’s common
    stock equal to the stated amount of $12.50 divided by the market
    value. If the market value was less than or equal to the
    reference price, the settlement rate, as adjusted for dividends
    in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase contracts,
    was 0.28835 shares of the Holding Company’s common
    stock. If the market value was greater than or equal to the
    threshold appreciation price, the settlement rate, as adjusted
    for dividends in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase
    contracts, was 0.23540 shares of the Holding Company’s
    common stock. Accordingly, upon settlement in the aggregate, the
    Holding Company received proceeds of $2,070 million and
    issued between 39.0 million and 47.8 million shares of
    its common stock. The stock purchase contract could have been
    exercised at the option of the holder at any time prior to the
    settlement date. However, upon early settlement, the holder
    would have received the minimum settlement rate. The Holding
    Company delivered 44,587,703 shares of its common stock in
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts.

The stock purchase contracts further required the Holding
    Company to pay the holder of the common equity unit quarterly
    contract payments on the stock purchase contracts at the annual
    rate of 1.510% on the stated amount of $25 per stock purchase
    contract until the initial stock purchase date and at the annual
    rate of 1.465% on the remaining stated amount of $12.50 per
    stock purchase contract thereafter.

The quarterly distributions on the Series A and
    Series B trust preferred securities of 4.82% and 4.91%,
    respectively, combined with the contract payments on the stock
    purchase contract of 1.510%, (1.465% after the initial stock
    purchase date) resulted in the 6.375% yield on the common equity
    units.

If the Holding Company had exercised its right to defer any of
    the contract payments on the stock purchase contract, then it
    would have accrued additional amounts on the deferred amounts at
    the annual rate of 6.375% until paid, to the extent permitted by
    law.

The value of the stock purchase contracts at issuance,
    $96.6 million, was calculated as the present value of the
    future contract payments due under the stock purchase contract
    of 1.510% through the initial stock purchase date, and 1.465% up
    to the subsequent stock purchase date, discounted at the
    interest rate on the supporting junior subordinated debentures
    issued by the Holding Company, 4.82% or 4.91% on the
    Series A and Series B trust preferred securities,
    respectively. The value of the stock purchase contracts was
    recorded in other liabilities with an offsetting decrease in
    additional paid-in capital. The other liability balance related
    to the stock purchase contracts accrued interest at the discount
    rate of 4.82% or 4.91%, as applicable, with an offsetting
    increase to interest expense. As the contract payments were made
    under the stock purchase contracts they reduced the other
    liability balance. During the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, the Holding Company increased the other
    liability balance for the accretion of the discount on the
    contract payment of $2 million, $2 million and
    $3 million, respectively and made contract payments of
    $26 million, $31 million and $31 million,
    respectively.

Issuance
    Costs

In connection with the offering of common equity units, the
    Holding Company incurred $55.3 million of issuance costs of
    which $5.8 million related to the issuance of the junior
    subordinated debentures underlying common equity units which
    funded the Series A and Series B trust preferred
    securities and $49.5 million related to the expected
    issuance of the common stock under the stock purchase contracts.
    The $5.8 million in debt issuance costs were capitalized,
    included in other assets, and amortized using the effective
    interest method over the period from issuance date of the common
    equity units to the initial and subsequent stock purchase date.
    The remaining $49.5 million of costs related to the common
    stock issuance under the stock purchase contracts and were
    recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

The stock purchase contracts are reflected in diluted earnings
    per common share using the treasury stock method. The stock
    purchase contracts were included in diluted earnings per common
    share for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
    as shown in Note 20.

Remarketing
    of Junior Subordinated Debentures and Settlement of Stock
    Purchase Contracts

On August 15, 2008, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series A portion of the
    junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity
    units. The Series A junior subordinated debentures were
    modified as permitted by their terms to be 6.817% senior
    debt securities Series A, due August 15, 2018. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debentures remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt. The initial settlement
    of the stock purchase contracts occurred on August 15,
    2008, providing proceeds to the Holding Company of
    $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the Holding
    Company’s common stock. The Holding Company delivered
    20,244,549 shares of its common stock held in treasury at a
    value of $1,064 million to settle the stock purchase
    contracts.

On February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series B portion of the
    junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity
    units. The Series B junior subordinated debentures were
    modified as permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior
    debt securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debentures remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt. The subsequent
    settlement of the stock purchase contracts occurred on
    February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the Holding
    Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of the
    Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock at a value of $1,035 million to settle the stock
    purchase contracts. See also Notes 10, 12, 18 and 25.

Domestic net operating loss carryforwards amount to
    $1,588 million at December 31, 2008 and will expire
    beginning in 2020. Foreign net operating loss carryforwards
    amount to $693 million at December 31, 2008 and were
    generated in various foreign countries with expiration periods
    of five years to indefinite expiration. Capital loss
    carryforwards amount to $781 million at December 31,
    2008 and will expire beginning in 2010. Tax credit carryforwards
    amount to $348 million at December 31, 2008.

The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to tax
    benefits of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and
    certain foreign unrealized losses. The valuation allowance
    reflects management’s assessment, based on available
    information, that it is more likely than not that the deferred
    income tax asset for certain foreign net operating loss
    carryforwards and certain foreign unrealized losses will not be
    realized. The tax benefit will be recognized when management
    believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred
    income tax assets are realizable. In 2008, the Company recorded
    an increase to the deferred tax valuation allowance of
    $145 million, of which $63 million related to certain
    foreign net operating loss carryforwards and $82 million
    related to certain foreign unrealized losses.

The Company has not established a valuation allowance against
    the deferred tax asset of $6,590 million recognized in
    connection with unrealized losses at December 31, 2008,
    other than the $82 million of valuation allowance

or maturity and the existence of tax-planning strategies that
    include sources of future taxable income against which such
    losses could be offset.

The Company files income tax returns with the U.S. federal
    government and various state and local jurisdictions, as well as
    foreign jurisdictions. The Company is under continuous
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    and other tax authorities in jurisdictions in which the Company
    has significant business operations. The income tax years under
    examination vary by jurisdiction. With a few exceptions, the
    Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and
    local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for
    years prior to 2000. In 2005, the IRS commenced an examination
    of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2000
    through 2002 that is anticipated to be completed in 2009.

As a result of the implementation of FIN 48 on
    January 1, 2007, the Company recognized a $35 million
    increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
    $9 million decrease in the interest liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits, as well as a $17 million
    increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a
    $5 million increase in the interest liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits which are included in liabilities of
    subsidiaries held-for-sale. The corresponding reduction to the
    January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings was
    $37 million, net of $11 million of minority interest
    included in liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale. The
    Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits upon
    adoption of FIN 48 was $932 million. The Company
    reclassified, at adoption, $602 million of current income
    tax payables to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits
    included within other liabilities. The Company also
    reclassified, at adoption, $295 million of deferred income
    tax liabilities, for which the ultimate deductibility is highly
    certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of
    such deductibility, to the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting,
    other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the
    shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
    effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to
    the taxing authority to an earlier period. The total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits as of January 1, 2007 that would
    affect the effective tax rate, if recognized, was
    $654 million. The Company also had $210 million of
    accrued interest, included within other liabilities, as of
    January 1, 2007. The Company classifies interest accrued
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense, while
    penalties are included within income tax expense.

At December 31, 2007, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $840 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $565 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $92 million from the date of adoption primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, post-sale purchase
    price adjustments and reinsurance offset by additions for tax
    positions of the current year. As a result of the settlements,
    items within the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, in the
    amount of $177 million, were reclassified to current and
    deferred income taxes, as applicable, and a payment of
    $156 million was made in December of 2007, with
    $6 million to be paid in 2009 and the remaining
    $15 million to be paid in future years.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s total amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits was $766 million and the total
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the
    effective tax rate, if recognized, was $567 million. The
    total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by
    $74 million from December 31, 2007 primarily due to
    settlements reached with the IRS with respect to certain
    significant issues involving demutualization, leasing and tax
    credits offset by additions for tax positions of the current
    year. As a result of the settlements, items within the liability
    for unrecognized tax benefits, in the amount of
    $153 million, were reclassified to current and deferred
    income taxes, as applicable. Of the $153 million
    reclassified to current and deferred income taxes,
    $20 million was paid in 2008 and $133 million will be
    paid in 2009.

The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits will
    change in the next 12 months pending the outcome of
    remaining issues associated with the current IRS audit including
    tax-exempt income and tax credits. Management is working to
    resolve the remaining audit items directly with IRS auditors, as
    well as through available accelerated IRS resolution programs
    and may protest any unresolved issues through the IRS appeals
    process and, possibly, litigation, the timing and extent of
    which is uncertain. At this time, a reasonable estimate of

F-104

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

the range of a payment or change in the liability is between
    $40 million and $50 million; however, the Company
    continues to believe that the ultimate resolution of the issues
    will not result in a material effect on its consolidated
    financial statements, although the resolution of income tax
    matters could impact the Company’s effective tax rate for a
    particular future period.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, is as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company
    recognized $81 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2007, the Company had $218 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $8 million increase, from the date of
    adoption, in accrued interest associated with the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an increase of
    $81 million of interest expense and a $73 million
    decrease primarily resulting from the aforementioned IRS
    settlements. During 2007, the $73 million resulting from
    IRS settlements was reclassified to current income tax payable
    and will be paid in 2009.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recognized $37 million in interest expense associated with
    the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had $176 million of
    accrued interest associated with the liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits. The $42 million decrease from
    December 31, 2007 in accrued interest associated with the
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulted from an
    increase of $37 million of interest expense and a
    $79 million decrease primarily resulting from the
    aforementioned IRS settlements. Of the $79 million
    decrease, $78 million has been reclassified to current
    income tax payable and the remaining $1 million reduced
    interest expense. Of the $78 million reclassified to
    current income tax payable, $7 million was paid in 2008 and
    the remainder of $71 million will be paid in 2009.

On September 25, 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling

2007-61,

which announced its intention to issue regulations with respect
    to certain computational aspects of the Dividends Received
    Deduction (“DRD”) on separate account assets held in
    connection with variable annuity contracts. Revenue Ruling

2007-61

suspended a revenue ruling issued in August 2007 that would have
    changed accepted industry and IRS interpretations of the
    statutes governing these computational questions. Any
    regulations that the IRS ultimately proposes for issuance in
    this area will be subject to public notice and comment, at which
    time insurance companies and other interested parties will have
    the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the
    content, scope and application of such regulations. As a result,
    the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are
    unknown at this time. For the years ended December 31, 2008
    and 2007, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of
    $179 million and $188 million, respectively, related
    to the separate account DRD.

16.  Contingencies,
    Commitments and Guarantees

Contingencies

Litigation

The Company is a defendant in a large number of litigation
    matters. In some of the matters, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Modern pleading practice in the United States
    permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary
    damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not
    to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants
    to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the
    jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may
    permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well
    exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for
    similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with
    the actual experience of the Company in litigating or resolving
    through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of
    time, demonstrate to management that the monetary relief which
    may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to
    its merits or disposition value. Thus, unless stated below, the
    specific monetary relief sought is not noted.

Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation
    matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular
    points in time may normally be inherently impossible to
    ascertain with any degree of certainty. Inherent uncertainties
    can include how fact finders will view individually and in their
    totality documentary evidence, the credibility and effectiveness
    of witnesses’ testimony, and how trial and appellate courts
    will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence
    presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal.
    Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of
    how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the
    relevant evidence and applicable law.

On a quarterly and annual basis, the Company reviews relevant
    information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be
    reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements. In 2007, the Company received $39 million upon
    the resolution of an indemnification claim associated with the
    2000 acquisition of General American Life Insurance Company
    (“GALIC”), and the Company reduced legal liabilities
    by $38 million after the settlement of certain cases. The
    review includes senior legal and financial personnel. Unless
    stated below, estimates of possible losses or ranges of loss for
    particular matters cannot in the ordinary course be made with a
    reasonable degree of certainty. Liabilities are established when
    it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of
    the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been
    established for a number of the matters noted below; in 2007 the
    Company increased legal liabilities for pending sales practices,
    employment, property and casualty and intellectual property
    litigation matters against the Company. It is possible that some
    of the matters could require the Company to pay damages or make
    other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could
    not be estimated at December 31, 2008.

Demutualization
    Actions

Several lawsuits were brought in 2000 challenging the fairness
    of the Plan and the adequacy and accuracy of MLIC’s
    disclosure to policyholders regarding the Plan. The actions
    discussed below name as defendants some or all of MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. MLIC, the Holding
    Company, and the individual directors believe they have
    meritorious defenses to the plaintiffs’ claims and are
    contesting vigorously all of the plaintiffs’ claims in
    these actions.

Fiala, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (Sup.
    Ct., N.Y. County, filed March 17, 2000).

The
    plaintiffs in the consolidated state court class action seek
    compensatory relief and punitive damages against MLIC, the
    Holding Company, and individual directors. The court has
    certified a litigation class of present and former policyholders
    on plaintiffs’ claim that defendants violated
    section 7312 of the New York Insurance Law. Pursuant to the
    court’s order, plaintiffs have given notice to the class of
    the pendency of this action. Defendants’ motion for summary
    judgment is pending.

In re MetLife Demutualization Litig. (E.D.N.Y., filed
    April 18, 2000).

In this class action
    against MLIC and the Holding Company, plaintiffs served a second
    consolidated amended complaint in 2004. Plaintiffs assert
    violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the Plan, claiming that
    the Policyholder Information Booklets failed to disclose certain
    material facts and contained certain material misstatements.
    They seek rescission and compensatory damages. By orders dated
    July 19, 2005 and August 29, 2006, the federal trial
    court certified a litigation class of present and former
    policyholders. The court has directed the manner and form of
    notice to the class, but plaintiffs have not yet distributed the
    notice. MLIC and the Holding Company have moved for summary
    judgment, and plaintiffs have moved for partial summary
    judgment. The court heard oral argument on the parties’
    motions for summary judgment on September 19, 2008.

Asbestos-Related
    Claims

MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of
    asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts. These
    suits principally allege that the plaintiff or plaintiffs
    suffered personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos and
    seek both actual and punitive damages. MLIC has never engaged in
    the business of manufacturing, producing, distributing or
    selling asbestos or asbestos-containing products nor has MLIC
    issued liability or workers’ compensation insurance to
    companies in the business of manufacturing, producing,
    distributing or selling asbestos or asbestos-containing
    products. The lawsuits principally have focused on allegations
    with respect to certain research, publication and other
    activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the
    period from the 1920’s through approximately the
    1950’s and allege that MLIC learned or should have learned
    of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other
    things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health
    risks. MLIC believes that it should not have legal liability in
    these cases. The outcome of most asbestos litigation matters,
    however, is uncertain and can be impacted by numerous variables,
    including differences in legal rulings in various jurisdictions,
    the nature of the alleged injury, and factors unrelated to the
    ultimate legal merit of the claims asserted against MLIC. MLIC
    employs a number of resolution strategies to manage its asbestos
    loss exposure, including seeking resolution of pending
    litigation by judicial rulings and settling individual or groups
    of claims or lawsuits under appropriate circumstances.

Claims asserted against MLIC have included negligence,
    intentional tort and conspiracy concerning the health risks
    associated with asbestos. MLIC’s defenses (beyond denial of
    certain factual allegations) include that: (i) MLIC owed no
    duty to the plaintiffs — it had no special
    relationship with the plaintiffs and did not manufacture,
    produce, distribute or sell the asbestos products that allegedly
    injured plaintiffs; (ii) plaintiffs did not rely on any
    actions of MLIC; (iii) MLIC’s conduct was not the
    cause of the plaintiffs’ injuries;
    (iv) plaintiffs’ exposure occurred after the dangers
    of asbestos were known; and (v) the applicable time with
    respect to filing suit has expired. During the course of the
    litigation, certain trial courts have granted motions dismissing
    claims against MLIC, while other trial courts have denied
    MLIC’s motions to dismiss. There can be no assurance that
    MLIC will receive favorable decisions on motions in the future.
    While most cases brought to date have settled, MLIC intends to
    continue to defend aggressively against claims based on asbestos
    exposure, including defending claims at trials.

The approximate total number of asbestos personal injury claims
    pending against MLIC as of the dates indicated, the approximate
    number of new claims during the years ended on those dates and
    the approximate total settlement payments made to resolve
    asbestos personal injury claims at or during those years are set
    forth in the following table:

(1)

Settlement payments represent payments made by MLIC during the
    year in connection with settlements made in that year and in
    prior years. Amounts do not include MLIC’s attorneys’
    fees and expenses and do not reflect amounts received from
    insurance carriers.

In 2005, MLIC received approximately 18,500 new claims, ending
    the year with a total of approximately 100,250 claims, and paid
    approximately $74.3 million for settlements reached in 2005
    and prior years. In 2004, MLIC received approximately 23,900 new
    claims, ending the year with a total of approximately 108,000
    claims, and paid approximately $85.5 million for
    settlements reached in 2004 and prior years. In 2003, MLIC
    received approximately 58,750 new claims, ending the year with a
    total of approximately 111,700 claims, and paid approximately
    $84.2 million for settlements reached in 2003 and prior
    years. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the
    aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the
    total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain
    and may vary significantly from year to year.

The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure
    is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions
    impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change.
    The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult
    to predict with any certainty the numerous variables that can
    affect liability estimates, including the number of future
    claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity
    of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the
    number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and
    variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are
    filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the
    willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims
    against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the
    dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of
    any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts.

The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos
    exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years
    further in the future. In the Company’s judgment, there is
    a future point after which losses cease to be probable and
    reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that the
    Company’s total exposure to asbestos claims may be
    materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued
    and that future charges to income may be necessary. While the
    potential future charges could be material in the particular
    quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded, based on
    information currently known by management, management does not
    believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse
    effect on the Company’s financial position.

During 1998, MLIC paid $878 million in premiums for excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims. The excess
    insurance policies for asbestos-related claims provided for
    recovery of losses up to $1.5 billion in excess of a
    $400 million self-insured retention. The Company’s
    initial option to commute the excess insurance policies for
    asbestos-related claims would have arisen at the end of 2008. On
    September 29, 2008, MLIC entered into agreements commuting
    the excess insurance policies as of September 30, 2008. As
    a result of the commutation of the policies, MLIC received cash
    and securities totaling $632 million. Of this total, MLIC
    received $115 million in fixed maturity securities on
    September 26, 2008, $200 million in cash on
    October 29, 2008, and $317 million in cash on
    January 29, 2009. MLIC recognized a loss on commutation of
    the policies in the amount of $35.3 million during 2008.

In the years prior to commutation, the excess insurance policies
    for asbestos-related claims were subject to annual and per claim
    sublimits. Amounts exceeding the sublimits during 2007, 2006 and
    2005 were approximately $16 million, $8 million and
    $0, respectively. Amounts were recoverable under the policies
    annually with respect to claims paid during the prior calendar
    year. Each asbestos-related policy contained an experience fund
    and a reference fund that provided for payments to MLIC at the
    commutation date if the reference fund was greater than zero at
    commutation or pro rata reductions from time to time in the loss
    reimbursements to MLIC if the cumulative return on the reference
    fund was less than the return specified in the experience fund.
    The return in the reference fund was tied to performance of the
    S&P 500 Index and the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
    A claim with respect to the prior year was made under the excess
    insurance policies in each year from 2003 through 2008 for the
    amounts paid with respect to asbestos litigation in excess of
    the retention. The foregone loss reimbursements were
    approximately $62.2 million with respect to claims for the
    period of 2002 through 2007. Because the policies were

F-108


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

commuted as of September 30, 2008, there will be no claims
    under the policies or forgone loss reimbursements with respect
    to payments made in 2008 and thereafter.

The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its
    consolidated financial statements for all probable and
    reasonably estimable losses for asbestos-related claims.
    MLIC’s recorded asbestos liability is based on its
    estimation of the following elements, as informed by the facts
    presently known to it, its understanding of current law, and its
    past experiences: (i) the probable and reasonably estimable
    liability for asbestos claims already asserted against MLIC,
    including claims settled but not yet paid; (ii) the
    probable and reasonably estimable liability for asbestos claims
    not yet asserted against MLIC, but which MLIC believes are
    reasonably probable of assertion; and (iii) the legal
    defense costs associated with the foregoing claims. Significant
    assumptions underlying MLIC’s analysis of the adequacy of
    its recorded liability with respect to asbestos litigation
    include: (i) the number of future claims; (ii) the
    cost to resolve claims; and (iii) the cost to defend claims.

MLIC reevaluates on a quarterly and annual basis its exposure
    from asbestos litigation, including studying its claims
    experience, reviewing external literature regarding asbestos
    claims experience in the United States, assessing relevant
    trends impacting asbestos liability and considering numerous
    variables that can affect its asbestos liability exposure on an
    overall or per claim basis. These variables include bankruptcies
    of other companies involved in asbestos litigation, legislative
    and judicial developments, the number of pending claims
    involving serious disease, the number of new claims filed
    against it and other defendants, and the jurisdictions in which
    claims are pending. As previously disclosed, in 2002 MLIC
    increased its recorded liability for asbestos-related claims by
    $402 million from approximately $820 million to
    $1,225 million. Based upon its regular reevaluation of its
    exposure from asbestos litigation, MLIC has updated its
    liability analysis for asbestos-related claims through
    December 31, 2008.

Regulatory
    Matters

The Company receives and responds to subpoenas or other
    inquiries from state regulators, including state insurance
    commissioners; state attorneys general or other state
    governmental authorities; federal regulators, including the SEC;
    federal governmental authorities, including congressional
    committees; and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
    seeking a broad range of information. The issues involved in
    information requests and regulatory matters vary widely. Certain
    regulators have requested information and documents regarding
    contingent commission payments to brokers, the Company’s
    awareness of any “sham” bids for business, bids and
    quotes that the Company submitted to potential customers,
    incentive agreements entered into with brokers, or compensation
    paid to intermediaries. Regulators also have requested
    information relating to market timing and late trading of mutual
    funds and variable insurance products and, generally, the
    marketing of products. The Company has received a subpoena from
    the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
    of California asking for documents regarding the insurance
    broker Universal Life Resources. The Company has been
    cooperating fully with these inquiries.

Regulatory authorities in a small number of states have had
    investigations or inquiries relating to sales of individual life
    insurance policies or annuities or other products by MLIC; New
    England Mutual Life Insurance Company, New England Life
    Insurance Company and New England Securities Corporation
    (collectively “New England”); GALIC; Walnut Street
    Securities, Inc. (“Walnut Street Securities”) and
    MetLife Securities, Inc. (“MSI”). Over the past
    several years, these and a number of investigations by other
    regulatory authorities were resolved for monetary payments and
    certain other relief. The Company may continue to resolve
    investigations in a similar manner.

MSI is a defendant in two regulatory matters brought by the
    Illinois Department of Securities. In 2005, MSI received a
    notice from the Illinois Department of Securities asserting
    possible violations of the Illinois Securities Act in connection
    with sales of a former affiliate’s mutual funds. A response
    has been submitted and in January 2008, MSI received notice of
    the commencement of an administrative action by the Illinois
    Department of Securities. In May 2008, MSI’s motion to
    dismiss the action was denied. In the second matter, in December

MSI received a Notice of Hearing from the Illinois Department of
    Securities based upon a complaint alleging that MSI failed to
    reasonably supervise one of its former registered
    representatives in connection with the sale of variable
    annuities to Illinois investors. MSI intends to vigorously
    defend against the claims in these matters.

In June 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a
    Notice of Violation (“NOV”) regarding the operations
    of the Homer City Generating Station, an electrical generation
    facility. The NOV alleges, among other things, that the
    electrical generation facility is being operated in violation of
    certain federal and state Clean Air Act requirements. Homer City
    OL6 LLC, an entity owned by MLIC, is a passive investor with a
    minority interest in the electrical generation facility, which
    is solely operated by the lessee, EME Homer City Generation L.P.
    (“EME Homer”). Homer City OL6 LLC and EME Homer are
    among the respondents identified in the NOV. EME Homer has been
    notified of its obligation to indemnify Homer City OL6 LLC and
    MLIC for any claims resulting from the NOV and has expressly
    acknowledged its obligation to indemnify Homer City OL6 LLC.

Other
    Litigation

Jacynthe Evoy-Larouche v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
    (Que. Super. Ct., filed March 1998).

This
    putative class action lawsuit involving sales practices claims
    is pending against MLIC in Canada. Plaintiff alleges
    misrepresentations regarding dividends and future payments for
    life insurance policies and seeks unspecified damages.

Travelers Ins. Co., et al. v. Banc of America Securities
    LLC (S.D.N.Y., filed December 13, 2001).

On
    January 6, 2009, after a jury trial

,

the district
    court entered a judgment in favor of The Travelers Insurance
    Company, now known as MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut,
    in the amount of approximately $42 million in connection
    with securities and common law claims against the defendant. The
    defendant has filed a post judgment motion seeking a judgment in
    its favor or, in the alternative, a new trial. If this motion is
    denied, the defendant will likely file an appeal. As it is
    possible that the judgment could be affected during the post
    judgment motion practice or upon appeal, and the Company has not
    collected any portion of the judgment, the Company has not
    recognized any award amount in its consolidated financial
    statements.

Shipley v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. and
    Metropolitan Property and Casualty Ins. Co. (Ill. Cir. Ct.,
    Madison County, filed February 26 and July 2,
    2003).

Two putative nationwide class actions have
    been filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance
    Company in Illinois. One suit claims breach of contract and
    fraud due to the alleged underpayment of medical claims arising
    from the use of a purportedly biased provider fee pricing
    system. The second suit currently alleges breach of contract
    arising from the alleged use of preferred provider organizations
    to reduce medical provider fees covered by the medical claims
    portion of the insurance policy. Motions for class certification
    have been filed and briefed in both cases. A third putative
    nationwide class action relating to the payment of medical
    providers,

Innovative Physical Therapy, Inc. v. MetLife
    Auto & Home, et ano (D. N.J., filed November 12,
    2007),

was filed against Metropolitan Property and Casualty
    Insurance Company in federal court in New Jersey. The court
    granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, and plaintiff
    appealed the dismissal. The Company is vigorously defending
    against the claims in these matters.

The American Dental Association, et al. v. MetLife Inc., et
    al. (S.D. Fla., filed May 19, 2003).

The
    American Dental Association and three individual providers have
    sued the Holding Company, MLIC and other non-affiliated
    insurance companies in a putative class action lawsuit. The
    plaintiffs purport to represent a nationwide class of

in-network

providers who allege that their claims are being wrongfully
    reduced by downcoding, bundling, and the improper use and
    programming of software. The complaint alleges federal
    racketeering and various state law theories of liability. On
    February 10, 2009, the district court granted the
    Company’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ second amended
    complaint, dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims except for
    breach of contract claims. Plaintiffs have been provided with an
    opportunity to re-plead the dismissed claims by
    February 26, 2009.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

companies and several insurance brokers violated the Racketeer
    Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (“RICO”), the
    Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
    (“ERISA”), and antitrust laws and committed other
    misconduct in the context of providing insurance to employee
    benefit plans and to persons who participate in such employee
    benefit plans. In August and September 2007 and January 2008,
    the court issued orders granting defendants’ motions to
    dismiss with prejudice the federal antitrust, the RICO, and the
    ERISA claims. In February 2008, the court dismissed the
    remaining state law claims on jurisdictional grounds.
    Plaintiffs’ appeal from the orders dismissing their RICO
    and federal antitrust claims is pending with the U.S. Court
    of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A putative class action
    alleging that the Holding Company and other non-affiliated
    defendants violated state laws was transferred to the District
    of New Jersey but was not consolidated with other related
    actions. Plaintiffs’ motion to remand this action to state
    court in Florida is pending.

MetLife v. Park Avenue Securities, et. al. (FINRA
    Arbitration, filed May 2006).

MetLife commenced
    an action against Park Avenue Securities LLC., a registered
    investment adviser and broker-dealer that is an indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary of The Guardian Life Insurance Company
    of America, alleging misappropriation of confidential and
    proprietary information and use of prohibited methods to solicit
    MetLife customers and recruit MetLife financial services
    representatives. On February 12, 2009, a Financial Industry
    Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) arbitration panel
    awarded MetLife $21 million in damages, including punitive
    damages and attorneys fees. Park Avenue Securities may appeal
    the award.

Thomas, et al. v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., et al. (W.D.
    Okla., filed January 31, 2007).

A putative
    class action complaint was filed against MLIC and MSI.
    Plaintiffs assert legal theories of violations of the federal
    securities laws and violations of state laws with respect to the
    sale of certain proprietary products by the Company’s
    agency distribution group. Plaintiffs seek rescission,
    compensatory damages, interest, punitive damages and
    attorneys’ fees and expenses. In January and May 2008, the
    court issued orders granting the defendants’ motion to
    dismiss in part, dismissing all of plaintiffs’ claims
    except for claims under the Investment Advisers Act.
    Defendants’ motion to dismiss claims under the Investment
    Advisers Act was denied. The Company will vigorously defend
    against the remaining claims in this matter.

Sales Practices Claims.

Over the past several
    years, MLIC, New England, GALIC, Walnut Street Securities and
    MSI have faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits,
    alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life
    insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.
    Some of the current cases seek substantial damages, including
    punitive and treble damages and attorneys’ fees. At
    December 31, 2008, there were approximately 125 sales
    practices litigation matters pending against the Company. The
    Company continues to vigorously defend against the claims in
    these matters. The Company believes adequate provision has been
    made in its consolidated financial statements for all probable
    and reasonably estimable losses for sales practices claims
    against MLIC, New England, GALIC, MSI and Walnut Street
    Securities.

Summary

Putative or certified class action litigation and other
    litigation and claims and assessments against the Company, in
    addition to those discussed previously and those otherwise
    provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements, have arisen in the course of the Company’s
    business, including, but not limited to, in connection with its
    activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor
    and taxpayer. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities
    and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries
    and conduct investigations concerning the Company’s
    compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and
    regulations.

It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of all
    pending investigations and legal proceedings or provide
    reasonable ranges of potential losses, except as noted
    previously in connection with specific matters. In some of the
    matters referred to previously, very large

and/or

indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages,
    are sought. Although in light of these considerations it is
    possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a
    material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial
    position, based on information currently known by the
    Company’s management, in its opinion, the outcomes of such
    pending investigations and legal proceedings are not

F-111


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

likely to have such an effect. However, given the large

and/or

indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the
    inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an
    adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time,
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
    consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or
    annual periods.

Insolvency
    Assessments

Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to
    transact business require insurers doing business within the
    jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are
    organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance
    policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These
    associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all
    member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the
    proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers
    in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or
    failed insurer engaged. Some states permit member insurers to
    recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax
    offsets. Assets and liabilities held for insolvency assessments
    are as follows:

Argentina

The Argentine economic, regulatory and legal environment,
    including interpretations of laws and regulations by regulators
    and courts, is uncertain. Potential legal or governmental
    actions related to pension reform, fiduciary responsibilities,
    performance guarantees and tax rulings could adversely affect
    the results of the Company.

Upon acquisition of Citigroup’s insurance operations in
    Argentina, the Company established insurance and contingent
    liabilities, most significantly related to death and disability
    policy coverages and to litigation against the government’s
    2002 Pesification Law. These liabilities were established based
    upon the Company’s interpretation of Argentine law at the
    time and the Company’s best estimate of its obligations
    under laws applicable at the time.

In 2006, a decree was issued by the Argentine Government
    regarding the taxability of pesification related gains resulting
    in the $8 million, net of income tax, reduction of certain
    tax liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2006.

In 2007, pension reform legislation in Argentina was enacted
    which relieved the Company of its obligation to provide death
    and disability policy coverages and resulted in the elimination
    of related insurance liabilities. The reform reinstituted the
    government’s pension plan system and allowed for pension
    participants to transfer their future contributions to the
    government pension plan system.

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Although it no longer receives compensation, the Company
    continued to be responsible for managing the funds of those
    participants that transferred to the government system. This
    change resulted in the establishment of a liability for future
    servicing obligations and the elimination of the Company’s
    obligations under death and disability policy coverages. The
    impact of the 2007 Argentine pension reform was an increase to
    net income of $114 million, net of income tax, due to the
    reduction of the insurance liabilities and other balances
    associated with the death and disability coverages of
    $197 million, net of income tax, which exceeded the
    establishment of the liability for future service obligations of
    $83 million, net of income tax, during the year ended
    December 31, 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, the
    future servicing obligation was reduced by $23 million, net
    of income tax, when information regarding the level of
    participation in the government pension plan became fully
    available.

In October 2008, the Argentine government announced its
    intention to nationalize private pensions and, in December 2008,
    the Argentine government nationalized the private pension system
    seizing the underlying investments of participants which were
    being managed by the Company (“Nationalization”). With
    this action, the Company’s pension business in Argentina
    ceased to exist and the Company eliminated certain assets and
    liabilities held in connection with the pension business.
    Deferred acquisition costs deferred tax assets, and
    liabilities — primarily the liability for future
    servicing obligation referred to above — were
    eliminated and the Company incurred severance costs associated
    with the termination of employees. The impact of the elimination
    of assets and liabilities and the incurral of severance costs
    was an increase to net income of $6 million, net of income
    tax, during the year ended December 31, 2008.

In September 2008, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled against the
    validity of the 2002 Pesification Law enacted by the Argentine
    government. This ruling applied to certain social security
    pension annuity contractholders that had filed a lawsuit against
    the 2002 Pesification Law. The annuity contracts impacted by
    this ruling, which were deemed peso denominated under the 2002
    Pesification Law, are now considered to be U.S. dollar
    denominated obligations of the Company. Contingent liabilities
    that were established at acquisition in 2005 in connection with
    the outstanding lawsuits have been adjusted and refined to be
    consistent with the ruling. The impact of the refinements
    resulting from the change in these contingent liabilities and
    the associated future policyholder benefits was an increase to
    net income of $34 million, net of income tax, during the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

As part of Nationalization, the Company may receive compensation
    from the Argentine government for the loss of the pension
    business in the form of government bonds. The amount of any such
    compensation, as well as the terms and value of the government
    bonds to be received, cannot be determined at this time. The
    compensation will only be reflected in the consolidated
    financial statements of the Company if and when the fair value
    of the compensation is received.

Further governmental or legal actions are possible in Argentina.
    Such actions may impact the level of existing liabilities or may
    create additional obligations or benefits to the Company’s
    operations in Argentina. Management has made its best estimate
    of its obligations based upon information currently available;
    however, further governmental or legal actions could result in
    changes in obligations which could materially impact the amounts
    presented within the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments

Leases

In accordance with industry practice, certain of the
    Company’s income from lease agreements with retail tenants
    are contingent upon the level of the tenants’ sales
    revenues. Additionally, the Company, as lessee, has entered into
    various lease and sublease agreements for office space, data
    processing and other equipment. Future

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company moved certain of
    its operations in New York from Long Island City to New York
    City. As a result of this movement of operations and current
    market conditions, which precluded the Company’s immediate
    and complete sublet of all unused space in both Long Island City
    and New York City, the Company incurred a lease impairment
    charge of $38 million which is included within other
    expenses in Corporate & Other. The impairment charge
    was determined based upon the present value of the gross rental
    payments less sublease income discounted at a risk-adjusted rate
    over the remaining lease terms which range from

15-20 years.

The Company has made assumptions with respect to the timing and
    amount of future sublease income in the determination of this
    impairment charge. Additional impairment charges could be
    incurred should market conditions deteriorate further or last
    for a period significantly longer than anticipated.

Commitments
    to Fund Partnership Investments

The Company makes commitments to fund partnership investments in
    the normal course of business. The amounts of these unfunded
    commitments were $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company
    anticipates that these amounts will be invested in partnerships
    over the next five years.

Mortgage
    Loan Commitments

The Company has issued interest rate lock commitments on certain
    residential mortgage loan applications totaling
    $8.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company intends
    to sell the majority of these originated residential mortgage
    loans. Interest rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans
    that will be held-for-sale are considered derivatives pursuant
    to SFAS 133, and their estimated fair value and notional
    amounts are included within financial forwards in Note 4.

The Company also commits to lend funds under certain other
    mortgage loan commitments that will be held-for-investment. The
    amounts of these mortgage loan commitments were
    $2.7 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Commitments
    to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans and Private
    Corporate Bond Investments

The Company commits to lend funds under bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. The amounts
    of these unfunded commitments were $1.0 billion and
    $1.2 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Guarantees

In the normal course of its business, the Company has provided
    certain indemnities, guarantees and commitments to third parties
    pursuant to which it may be required to make payments now or in
    the future. In the context of acquisition, disposition,
    investment and other transactions, the Company has provided
    indemnities and guarantees, including those related to tax,
    environmental and other specific liabilities, and other
    indemnities

F-114


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

and guarantees that are triggered by, among other things,
    breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by
    the Company. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
    Company provides indemnifications to counterparties in contracts
    with triggers similar to the foregoing, as well as for certain
    other liabilities, such as third party lawsuits. These
    obligations are often subject to time limitations that vary in
    duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise
    by operation of law, such as applicable statutes of limitation.
    In some cases, the maximum potential obligation under the
    indemnities and guarantees is subject to a contractual
    limitation ranging from less than $1 million to
    $800 million, with a cumulative maximum of
    $1.6 billion, while in other cases such limitations are not
    specified or applicable. Since certain of these obligations are
    not subject to limitations, the Company does not believe that it
    is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that could
    become due under these guarantees in the future. Management
    believes that it is unlikely the Company will have to make any
    material payments under these indemnities, guarantees, or
    commitments.

In addition, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers
    as provided in its charters and by-laws. Also, the Company
    indemnifies its agents for liabilities incurred as a result of
    their representation of the Company’s interests. Since
    these indemnities are generally not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these indemnities in the future.

The Company has also guaranteed minimum investment returns on
    certain international retirement funds in accordance with local
    laws. Since these guarantees are not subject to limitation with
    respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that
    it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount that
    could become due under these guarantees in the future.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company
    recorded $7 million of additional liabilities for
    guarantees related to certain investment transactions. The term
    for these guarantees and their associated liabilities varies,
    with a maximum of 18 years. The maximum potential amount of
    future payments the Company could be required to pay under these
    guarantees is $202 million. During the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Company reduced $7 million of
    previously recorded liabilities related to indemnifications
    provided in connection with the disposition of real estate
    property and other investment transactions. The Company’s
    recorded liabilities were $6 million at both
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 for indemnities, guarantees and
    commitments.

In connection with synthetically created investment
    transactions, the Company writes credit default swap obligations
    that generally require payment of principal outstanding due in
    exchange for the referenced credit obligation. If a credit
    event, as defined by the contract, occurs the Company’s
    maximum amount at risk, assuming the value of all referenced
    credits obligations is zero, was $1.9 billion at
    December 31, 2008. The Company can terminate these
    contracts at any time through cash settlement with the
    counterparty at an amount equal to the then current fair value
    of the credit default swaps. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company would have paid $37 million to terminate all of
    these contracts.

See Note 4 for further disclosures related to credit
    default swap obligations.

Employee
    Benefit Plans

Pension
    and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Subsidiaries sponsor

and/or

administer various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
    pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans
    covering employees and sales representatives who meet specified
    eligibility requirements. Pension benefits are provided
    utilizing either a traditional formula or cash balance formula.
    The traditional formula provides benefits based upon years of
    credited service and either final average or career average
    earnings. The cash balance formula utilizes hypothetical or
    notional accounts which credit participants with benefits equal
    to a percentage of eligible pay, as well as earnings credits,
    determined annually based upon the average annual rate of
    interest on

30-year

U.S. Treasury securities, for each account balance. At
    December 31, 2008, the majority of active participants are
    accruing benefits under the cash balance formula; however,

F-115


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

approximately 95% of the Subsidiaries’ obligations result
    from benefits calculated with the traditional formula. The
    non-qualified pension plans provide supplemental benefits, in
    excess of amounts permitted by governmental agencies, to certain
    executive level employees.

The Subsidiaries also provide certain postemployment benefits
    and certain postretirement medical and life insurance benefits
    for retired employees. Employees of the Subsidiaries who were
    hired prior to 2003 (or, in certain cases, rehired during or
    after 2003) and meet age and service criteria while working
    for one of the Subsidiaries, may become eligible for these other
    postretirement benefits, at various levels, in accordance with
    the applicable plans. Virtually all retirees, or their
    beneficiaries, contribute a portion of the total cost of
    postretirement medical benefits. Employees hired after 2003 are
    not eligible for any employer subsidy for postretirement medical
    benefits.

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158. The
    adoption of SFAS 158 required the recognition of the funded
    status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    benefit plans and eliminated the additional minimum pension
    liability provision of SFAS 87. The Company’s
    additional minimum pension liability was $78 million, and
    the intangible asset was $12 million, at December 31,
    2005. The excess of the additional minimum pension liability
    over the intangible asset of $66 million, $41 million
    net of income tax, was recorded as a reduction of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2006,
    immediately prior to adopting SFAS 158, the Company’s
    additional minimum pension liability was $92 million. The
    additional minimum pension liability of $59 million, net of
    income tax of $33 million, was recorded as a reduction of
    accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in the
    additional minimum pension liability of $18 million, net of
    income tax, was reflected as a component of comprehensive income
    for the year ended December 31, 2006. Upon adoption of
    SFAS 158, the Company eliminated the additional minimum
    pension liability and recognized as an adjustment to accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss), net of income tax, those
    amounts of actuarial gains and losses, prior service costs and
    credits, and the remaining net transition asset or obligation
    that had not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost at
    the date of adoption.

The following table summarizes the adjustments to the
    December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet as a result of
    recognizing the funded status of the defined benefit plans:

The discount rate is determined annually based on the yield,
    measured on a yield to worst basis, of a hypothetical portfolio
    constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the
    valuation date, which would provide the necessary future cash
    flows to pay the aggregate projected benefit obligation when due.

F-120


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on
    anticipated performance of the various asset sectors in which
    the plan invests, weighted by target allocation percentages.
    Anticipated future performance is based on long-term historical
    returns of the plan assets by sector, adjusted for the
    Subsidiaries’ long-term expectations on the performance of
    the markets. While the precise expected return derived using
    this approach will fluctuate from year to year, the
    Subsidiaries’ policy is to hold this long-term assumption
    constant as long as it remains within reasonable tolerance from
    the derived rate.

The weighted average expected return on plan assets for use in
    that plan’s valuation in 2009 is currently anticipated to
    be 8.25% for pension benefits and postretirement medical
    benefits and 6.25% for postretirement life benefits.

The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the
    APBO and net periodic benefit cost were as follows:

December 31,



Pre-Medicare eligible claims

8.8% down to 5.8% in 2018 and

gradually decreasing  until 2079

reaching the ultimate rate of 4.1%

8.5% down to 5% in 2014 and

remaining constant  thereafter

Medicare eligible claims

8.8% down to 5.8% in 2018 and

gradually decreasing  until 2079

reaching the ultimate rate of 4.1%

10.5% down to 5% in 2018 and

remaining constant thereafter

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant
    effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans. A
    one-percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend
    rates would have the following effects:

Plan
    Assets

The Subsidiaries have issued group annuity and life insurance
    contracts supporting approximately 99% of all pension and other
    postretirement benefit plans assets.

The account values of the group annuity and life insurance
    contracts issued by the Subsidiaries and held as assets of the
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans were
    $6,451 million and $7,565 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The majority of such account values
    are held in separate accounts established by the Subsidiaries.
    Total revenue from these contracts recognized in the
    consolidated statements of income was $42 million,
    $47 million and $48 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
    includes policy charges, net investment income from investments
    backing the contracts and administrative fees. Total investment
    income (loss), including realized and unrealized gains and
    losses, credited to the account balances were
    ($1,090) million, $603 million and $818 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The terms of these contracts are consistent in all
    material respects with those the Subsidiaries offer to
    unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated.

Target allocations of assets are determined with the objective
    of maximizing returns and minimizing volatility of net assets
    through adequate asset diversification. Adjustments are made to
    target allocations based on an assessment of the impact of
    economic factors and market conditions.

Cash
    Flows

It is the Subsidiaries’ practice to make contributions to
    the qualified pension plans to comply with minimum funding
    requirements of ERISA. In accordance with such practice, no
    contributions were required for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 or 2007. No contributions will be
    required for 2009. The Subsidiaries made discretionary
    contributions of $300 million to the qualified pension
    plans during the year ended December 31, 2008 and did not
    make discretionary contributions for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The Subsidiaries expect to make
    additional discretionary contributions of $150 million in
    2009.

Benefit payments due under the non-qualified pension plans are
    funded from the Subsidiaries’ general assets as they become
    due under the provision of the plans. These payments totaled
    $43 million and $48 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. These payments
    are expected to be at approximately the same level in 2009.

Other postretirement benefits represent a non-vested,
    non-guaranteed obligation of the Subsidiaries and current
    regulations do not require specific funding levels for these
    benefits. While the Subsidiaries have partially funded such
    plans in advance, it has been the Subsidiaries’ practice to
    primarily use their general assets, net of participant’s
    contributions, to pay postretirement medical claims as they come
    due in lieu of utilizing plan assets. Total payments equaled
    $149 million and $173 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Subsidiaries’ expect to make contributions of
    $120 million, net of participant’s contributions,
    towards the other postretirement plan obligations in 2009. As
    noted previously, the Subsidiaries expect to receive subsidies
    under the Prescription Drug Act to partially offset such
    payments.

The Subsidiaries sponsor savings and investment plans for
    substantially all employees under which a portion of employee
    contributions are matched. The Subsidiaries contributed
    $70 million, $76 million and $80 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Equity

Preferred
    Stock

In September 1999, the Holding Company adopted a stockholder
    rights plan (the “rights plan”) under which each
    outstanding share of common stock issued between April 4,
    2000 and the distribution date (as defined in the rights plan)
    will be coupled with a stockholder right. Each right will
    entitle the holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Each one
    one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock will have economic and voting terms equivalent
    to one share of common stock. Until it is exercised, the right
    itself will not entitle the holder thereof to any rights as a
    stockholder, including the right to receive dividends or to vote
    at stockholder meetings. Stockholder rights are not exercisable
    until the distribution date, and will expire at the close of
    business on April 4, 2010, unless earlier redeemed or
    exchanged by the Holding Company. The rights plan is designed to
    protect stockholders in the event of unsolicited offers to
    acquire the Holding Company and other coercive takeover tactics.

The Holding Company has outstanding 24 million shares of
    Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A (the
    “Series A preferred shares”) with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $600 million.

The Holding Company has outstanding 60 million shares of
    6.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B (the
    “Series B preferred shares”), with a
    $0.01 par value per share, and a liquidation preference of
    $25 per share, for aggregate proceeds of $1.5 billion.

The Series A and Series B preferred shares (the
    “Preferred Shares”) rank senior to the common stock
    with respect to dividends and liquidation rights. Dividends on
    the Preferred Shares are not cumulative. Holders of the
    Preferred Shares will be entitled to receive dividend payments
    only when, as and if declared by the Holding Company’s
    Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee of the board.
    If dividends are declared on the Series A preferred shares,
    they will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an annual rate of
    the greater of: (i) 1.00% above

3-month

LIBOR on the related LIBOR determination date; or
    (ii) 4.00%. Any dividends declared on the Series B
    preferred shares will be payable quarterly, in arrears, at an
    annual fixed rate of 6.50%. Accordingly, in the event that
    dividends are not declared on the Preferred Shares for payment
    on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to
    accrue and be payable. If a dividend is not declared before the
    dividend payment date, the

F-123


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Holding Company has no obligation to pay dividends accrued for
    that dividend period whether or not dividends are declared and
    paid in future periods. No dividends may, however, be paid or
    declared on the Holding Company’s common stock —
    or any other securities ranking junior to the Preferred
    Shares — unless the full dividends for the latest
    completed dividend period on all Preferred Shares, and any
    parity stock, have been declared and paid or provided for.

The Holding Company is prohibited from declaring dividends on
    the Preferred Shares if it fails to meet specified capital
    adequacy, net income and shareholders’ equity levels. In
    addition, under Federal Reserve Bank of New York Board policy,
    the Holding Company may not be able to pay dividends if it does
    not earn sufficient operating income.

The Preferred Shares do not have voting rights except in certain
    circumstances where the dividends have not been paid for an
    equivalent of six or more dividend payment periods whether or
    not those periods are consecutive. Under such circumstances, the
    holders of the Preferred Shares have certain voting rights with
    respect to members of the Board of Directors of the Holding
    Company.

The Preferred Shares are not subject to any mandatory
    redemption, sinking fund, retirement fund, purchase fund or
    similar provisions. The Preferred Shares are redeemable, but not
    prior to September 15, 2010. On and after that date,
    subject to regulatory approval, the Preferred Shares will be
    redeemable at the Holding Company’s option in whole or in
    part, at a redemption price of $25 per Preferred Share, plus
    declared and unpaid dividends.

In December 2008, the Holding Company entered into an RCC
    related to the Preferred Shares. As a part of the RCC, the
    Holding Company agreed that it will not repay, redeem or
    purchase the Preferred Shares on or before December 31,
    2018, unless such repayment, redemption or purchase is made from
    the proceeds of the issuance of certain capital securities. The
    RCC is for the benefit of holders of one or more series of its
    indebtedness as designated from time to time by the Company. The
    RCC will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events,
    including the date on which there are no series of outstanding
    eligible debt securities.

In connection with the offering of the Preferred Shares, the
    Holding Company incurred $56.8 million of issuance costs
    which have been recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in
    capital.

Common
    Stock

Repurchases

At January 1, 2007, the Company had $216 million
    remaining under its October 2004 stock repurchase program
    authorization. In February 2007, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock
    repurchase program. In September 2007, the Company’s Board
    of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common
    stock repurchase program which began after the completion of the
    $1 billion common stock repurchase program authorized in
    February 2007. In January 2008, the Company’s Board of
    Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common stock
    repurchase program, which began after the completion of the
    September 2007 program. In April 2008, the Company’s Board
    of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion common
    stock repurchase program, which will begin after the completion
    of the January 2008 program. Under these authorizations, the
    Company may purchase its common stock from the MetLife
    Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to
    the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of

Rule 10b5-1

under the Exchange Act) and in privately negotiated transactions.

In February 2008, the Company entered into an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. Under the
    agreement, the Company paid the bank $711 million in cash
    and the bank delivered an initial amount of
    11,161,550 shares of the Company’s outstanding common
    stock that the bank borrowed from third parties. In May 2008,
    the bank delivered an additional 864,646 shares of the
    Company’s common stock to the Company resulting in a total
    of 12,026,196 shares being repurchased under the agreement.
    The Company recorded the shares repurchased as treasury stock.

In December 2007, the Company entered into an accelerated common
    stock repurchase agreement with a major bank. Under the terms of
    the agreement, the Company paid the bank $450 million in
    cash in January 2008 in

exchange for 6,646,692 shares of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock that the bank borrowed from third
    parties. Also in January 2008, the bank delivered 1,043,530
    additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the
    Company resulting in a total of 7,690,222 shares being
    repurchased under the agreement. At December 31, 2007, the
    Company recorded the obligation to pay $450 million to the
    bank as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Upon
    settlement with the bank, the Company increased additional
    paid-in capital and reduced treasury stock.

In November 2007, the Company repurchased 11,559,803 shares
    of its outstanding common stock at an initial cost of
    $750 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the stock sold to
    the Company from third parties and purchased the common stock in
    the open market to return to such third parties. Also, in
    November 2007, the Company received a cash adjustment of
    $19 million based on the trading prices of the common stock
    during the repurchase period, for a final purchase price of
    $731 million. The Company recorded the shares initially
    repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount received
    as an adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

In March 2007, the Company repurchased 11,895,321 shares of
    its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $750 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the common stock
    sold to the Company from third parties and purchased common
    stock in the open market to return to such third parties. In
    June 2007, the Company paid a cash adjustment of
    $17 million for a final purchase price of
    $767 million. The Company recorded the shares initially
    repurchased as treasury stock and recorded the amount paid as an
    adjustment to the cost of the treasury stock.

In December 2006, the Company repurchased 3,993,024 shares
    of its outstanding common stock at an aggregate cost of
    $232 million under an accelerated common stock repurchase
    agreement with a major bank. The bank borrowed the common stock
    sold to the Company from third parties and purchased the common
    stock in the open market to return to such third parties. In
    February 2007, the Company paid a cash adjustment of
    $8 million for a final purchase price of $240 million.
    The Company recorded the shares initially repurchased as
    treasury stock and recorded the amount paid as an adjustment to
    the cost of the treasury stock.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company repurchased 1,550,000 shares and
    3,171,700 shares, respectively, through open market
    purchases for $88 million and $200 million,
    respectively.

The Company repurchased 21,266,418 and 26,626,824 shares of
    its common stock for $1,250 million and
    $1,705 million, respectively, during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. At
    December 31, 2008, an aggregate of $1,261 million
    remains available under the Company’s January 2008 and
    April 2008 common stock repurchase programs. The Company does
    not intend to make any purchases under the common stock
    repurchase program in 2009.

In connection with the split-off of RGA as described in
    Note 2, the Company received from MetLife stockholders
    23,093,689 shares of the Company’s common stock with a
    market value of $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA Class B common stock with a
    net book value of $1,716 million resulting in a loss on
    disposition, including transaction costs, of $458 million.

Future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon several
    factors, including the Company’s capital position, its
    financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions
    and the price of the Company’s common stock.

Issuances

As described in Note 13, in August 2008, the Company
    delivered 20,244,549 shares of its common stock from

Stock-Based
    Compensation Plans

Overview

As described more fully in Note 1, effective
    January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(r),
    using the modified prospective transition method. The adoption
    of SFAS 123(r) did not have a significant impact on the
    Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Description
    of Plans

The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
    “Stock Incentive Plan”), authorized the granting of
    awards in the form of options to buy shares of the
    Company’s common stock (“Stock Options”) that
    either qualify as incentive Stock Options under
    Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code or are
    non-qualified. The MetLife, Inc. 2000 Directors Stock Plan,
    as amended (the “Directors Stock Plan”), authorized
    the granting of awards in the form of the Company’s common
    stock, non-qualified Stock Options, or a combination of the
    foregoing to outside Directors of the Company. Under the
    MetLife, Inc. 2005 Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan, as
    amended (the “2005 Stock Plan”), awards granted may be
    in the form of Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights,
    Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, Performance Shares
    or Performance Share Units, Cash-Based Awards, and Stock-Based
    Awards (each as defined in the 2005 Stock Plan). Under the
    MetLife, Inc. 2005 Non-Management Director Stock Compensation
    Plan (the “2005 Directors Stock Plan”), awards
    granted may be in the form of non-qualified Stock Options, Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units,
    or Stock-Based Awards (each as defined in the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan). The Stock Incentive Plan,
    Directors Stock Plan, 2005 Stock Plan, the 2005 Directors
    Stock Plan and the LTPCP, as described below, are hereinafter
    collectively referred to as the “Incentive Plans.”

The aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the
    2005 Stock Plan and the LTPCP is 68,000,000, plus those shares
    available but not utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan and
    those shares utilized under the Stock Incentive Plan that are
    recovered due to forfeiture of Stock Options. Additional shares
    carried forward from the Stock Incentive Plan and available for
    issuance under the 2005 Stock Plan were 12,584,119 at
    December 31, 2008.

F-127


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

There were no shares carried forward from the Directors Stock
    Plan. Each share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in connection
    with a Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right reduces the
    number of shares remaining for issuance under that plan by one,
    and each share issued under the 2005 Stock Plan in connection
    with awards other than Stock Options or Stock Appreciation
    Rights reduces the number of shares remaining for issuance under
    that plan by 1.179 shares. The number of shares reserved
    for issuance under the 2005 Directors Stock Plan are
    2,000,000. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate number of
    shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to the 2005
    Stock Plan and the 2005 Directors Stock Plan were
    55,654,550 and 1,894,876, respectively.

Stock Option exercises and other stock-based awards to employees
    settled in shares are satisfied through the issuance of shares
    held in treasury by the Company. Under the current authorized
    share repurchase program, as described previously, sufficient
    treasury shares exist to satisfy foreseeable obligations under
    the Incentive Plans.

Compensation expense related to awards under the Incentive Plans
    is recognized based on the number of awards expected to vest,
    which represents the awards granted less expected forfeitures
    over the life of the award, as estimated at the date of grant.
    Unless a material deviation from the assumed rate is observed
    during the term in which the awards are expensed, any adjustment
    necessary to reflect differences in actual experience is
    recognized in the period the award becomes payable or
    exercisable. Compensation expense of $121 million,
    $145 million and $144 million, and income tax benefits
    of $42 million, $51 million and $50 million,
    related to the Incentive Plans was recognized for the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Compensation expense is principally related to the issuance of
    Stock Options, Performance Shares and LTPCP arrangements.

As described in Note 1, the Company changed its policy
    prospectively for recognizing expense for stock-based awards to
    retirement eligible employees. Had the Company continued to
    recognize expense over the stated requisite service period,
    compensation expense related to the Incentive Plans would have
    been $100 million, $118 million and $116 million,
    rather than $121 million, $145 million and
    $144 million, for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Had the Company applied the policy
    of recognizing expense related to stock-based compensation over
    the shorter of the requisite service period or the period to
    attainment of retirement eligibility for awards granted prior to
    January 1, 2006, pro forma compensation expense would have
    been $100 million, $118 million and $120 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Stock
    Options

All Stock Options granted had an exercise price equal to the
    closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on
    the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant, and have a
    maximum term of ten years. Certain Stock Options granted under
    the Stock Incentive Plan and the 2005 Stock Plan have or will
    become exercisable over a three year period commencing with the
    date of grant, while other Stock Options have or will become
    exercisable three years after the date of grant. Stock Options
    issued under the Directors Stock Plan were exercisable
    immediately. The date at which any Stock Option issued under the
    2005 Directors Stock Plan becomes exercisable would be
    determined at the time such Stock Option is granted.

A summary of the activity related to Stock Options for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 is presented below. The aggregate
    intrinsic value was computed using the closing share price on
    December 31, 2008 of $34.86 and December 31, 2007 of
    $61.62, as applicable.

The fair value of Stock Options is estimated on the date of
    grant using a binomial lattice model. Significant assumptions
    used in the Company’s binomial lattice model, which are
    further described below, include: expected volatility of the
    price of the Holding Company’s common stock; risk-free rate
    of return; expected dividend yield on the Holding Company’s
    common stock; exercise multiple; and the post-vesting
    termination rate.

Expected volatility is based upon an analysis of historical
    prices of the Holding Company’s common stock and call
    options on that common stock traded on the open market. The
    Company uses a weighted-average of the implied volatility for
    publicly-traded call options with the longest remaining maturity
    nearest to the money as of each valuation date and the
    historical volatility, calculated using monthly closing prices
    of the Holding Company’s common stock. The Company chose a
    monthly measurement interval for historical volatility as it
    believes this better depicts the nature of employee option
    exercise decisions being based on longer-term trends in the
    price of the underlying shares rather than on daily price
    movements.

The binomial lattice model used by the Company incorporates
    different risk-free rates based on the imputed forward rates for
    U.S. Treasury Strips for each year over the contractual
    term of the option. The table below presents the full range of
    rates that were used for options granted during the respective
    periods.

Dividend yield is determined based on historical dividend
    distributions compared to the price of the underlying common
    stock as of the valuation date and held constant over the life
    of the Stock Option.

The binomial model used by the Company incorporates the
    contractual term of the Stock Options and then factors in
    expected exercise behavior and a post-vesting termination rate,
    or the rate at which vested options are exercised or expire
    prematurely due to termination of employment, to derive an
    expected life. Exercise behavior in the binomial lattice model
    used by the Company is expressed using an exercise multiple,
    which reflects the ratio of exercise price to the strike price
    of Stock Options granted at which holders of the Stock Options
    are expected to exercise. The exercise multiple is derived from
    actual historical exercise activity. The post-vesting
    termination rate is determined from actual historical exercise
    experience and expiration activity under the Incentive Plans.

Compensation expense related to Stock Option awards expected to
    vest and granted prior to January 1, 2006 is recognized
    ratably over the requisite service period, which equals the
    vesting term. Compensation expense related to Stock Option
    awards expected to vest and granted on or after January 1,
    2006 is recognized ratably over the requisite service period or
    the period to retirement eligibility, if shorter. Compensation
    expense of $51 million, $55 million and
    $56 million related to Stock Options was recognized for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, there were $43 million of total
    unrecognized compensation costs related to Stock Options. It is
    expected that these costs will be recognized over a weighted
    average period of 1.81 years.

Performance
    Shares

Beginning in 2005, certain members of management were awarded
    Performance Shares under (and as defined in) the 2005 Stock
    Plan. Participants are awarded an initial target number of
    Performance Shares with the final number of Performance Shares
    payable being determined by the product of the initial target
    multiplied by a factor of 0.0 to 2.0. The factor applied is
    based on measurements of the Company’s performance with
    respect to: (i) the change in annual net operating earnings
    per share, as defined; and (ii) the proportionate total
    shareholder return, as defined, with reference to the three-year
    performance period relative to other companies in the S&P
    Insurance Index with reference to the same three-year period.
    Performance Share awards will normally vest in their entirety at
    the end of the three-year performance period (subject to certain
    contingencies) and will be payable entirely in shares of the
    Company’s common stock.

Performance Share amounts above represent aggregate initial
    target awards and do not reflect potential increases or
    decreases resulting from the final performance factor to be
    determined at the end of the respective performance period. At
    December 31, 2008, the three year performance period for
    the 2006 Performance Share grants was completed. Included in the
    immediately preceding table are 812,975 outstanding Performance
    Shares to which the final performance factor will be applied.
    The calculation of the performance factor is expected to be
    finalized during the second quarter of 2009 after all data
    necessary to perform the calculation is publicly available.

Performance Share awards are accounted for as equity awards but
    are not credited with dividend-equivalents for actual dividends
    paid on the Holding Company’s common stock during the
    performance period. Accordingly, the estimated fair value of
    Performance Shares is based upon the closing price of the
    Holding Company’s common stock on the date of grant,
    reduced by the present value of estimated dividends to be paid
    on that stock during the performance period.

Compensation expense related to initial Performance Shares
    granted prior to January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is
    recognized ratably during the performance period. Compensation
    expense related to initial Performance Shares granted on or
    after January 1, 2006 and expected to vest is recognized
    ratably over the performance period or the period to retirement
    eligibility, if shorter. Performance Shares expected to vest and
    the related compensation expenses may be further adjusted by the
    performance factor most likely to be achieved, as estimated by
    management, at the end of the performance period. Compensation
    expense of $70 million, $90 million and
    $74 million, related to Performance Shares was recognized
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

At December 31, 2008, there were $57 million of total
    unrecognized compensation costs related to Performance Share
    awards. It is expected that these costs will be recognized over
    a weighted average period of 1.65 years.

Long-Term
    Performance Compensation Plan

Prior to January 1, 2005, the Company granted stock-based
    compensation to certain members of management under the LTPCP.
    Each participant was assigned a target compensation amount (an
    “Opportunity Award”) at the inception of the
    performance period with the final compensation amount determined
    based on the total shareholder return on the Company’s
    common stock over the three-year performance period, subject to
    limited further adjustment approved by the Company’s Board
    of Directors. Payments on the Opportunity Awards were normally
    payable in their entirety (subject to certain contingencies) at
    the end of the three-year performance period, and were paid in
    whole or in part with shares of the Company’s common stock,
    as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. There were
    no new grants under the LTPCP during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

A portion of each Opportunity Award under the LTPCP was settled
    in shares of the Holding Company’s common stock while the
    remainder was settled in cash. The portion of the Opportunity
    Award settled in shares of the

F-131


MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Holding Company’s common stock was accounted for as an
    equity award with the fair value of the award determined based
    upon the closing price of the Holding Company’s common
    stock on the date of grant. The compensation expense associated
    with the equity award, based upon the grant date fair value, was
    recognized into expense ratably over the respective three-year
    performance period. The portion of the Opportunity Award settled
    in cash was accounted for as a liability and was remeasured
    using the closing price of the Holding Company’s common
    stock on the final day of each subsequent reporting period
    during the three-year performance period.

The final LTPCP performance period concluded during the six
    months ended June 30, 2007. Final Opportunity Awards in the
    amount of 618,375 shares of the Company’s common stock
    and $16 million in cash were paid on April 18, 2007.
    No significant compensation expense related to LTPCP was
    recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007. Compensation expense of $14 million related to LTPCP
    Opportunity Awards was recognized for the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Statutory
    Equity and Income

Each insurance company’s state of domicile imposes minimum
    risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements that were
    developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”). The formulas for determining the amount of
    RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to
    financial balances or various levels of activity based on the
    perceived degree of risk. Regulatory compliance is determined by
    a ratio of total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to
    authorized control level RBC, as defined by the NAIC.
    Companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified
    within certain levels, each of which requires specified
    corrective action. Each of the Holding Company’s
    U.S. insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum RBC
    requirements for all periods presented herein.

The NAIC has adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting
    Principles (“Codification”). Codification is intended
    to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state
    insurance departments. However, statutory accounting principles
    continue to be established by individual state laws and
    permitted practices. The New York Insurance Department has
    adopted Codification with certain modifications for the
    preparation of statutory financial statements of insurance
    companies domiciled in New York. Modifications by the various
    state insurance departments may impact the effect of
    Codification on the statutory capital and surplus of the Holding
    Company’s insurance subsidiaries.

Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily by
    charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred,
    establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different
    actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus
    instead of debt and valuing securities on a different basis.

In addition, certain assets are not admitted under statutory
    accounting principles and are charged directly to surplus. The
    most significant assets not admitted by the Company are net
    deferred income tax assets resulting from temporary differences
    between statutory accounting principles basis and tax basis not
    expected to reverse and become recoverable within a year.
    Further, statutory accounting principles do not give recognition
    to purchase accounting adjustments.

Statutory net income (loss) of Metropolitan Life Insurance
    Company, a New York domiciled insurer, was ($338) million,
    $2.1 billion and $1.0 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Statutory
    capital and surplus, as filed with the Department, was
    $11.6 billion and $13.0 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Statutory net income of MetLife Insurance Company of
    Connecticut, a Connecticut domiciled insurer, was
    $242 million, $1.1 billion, and $856 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,

Under New York State Insurance Law, MLIC is permitted, without
    prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay stockholder
    dividends to the Holding Company as long as the aggregate amount
    of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the
    lesser of: (i) 10% of its surplus to policyholders as of
    the end of the immediately preceding calendar year; or
    (ii) its statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year (excluding realized capital
    gains). MLIC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend to the
    Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only
    if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend
    and the amount thereof with the Superintendent and the
    Superintendent does not disapprove the distribution within
    30 days of its filing. Under New York State Insurance Law,
    the Superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether
    the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would
    support the payment of such dividends to its shareholders. The
    New York State Department of Insurance (the
    “Department”) has established informal guidelines for
    such determinations. The guidelines, among other things, focus
    on the insurer’s overall financial condition and
    profitability under statutory accounting practices.

Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, MICC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay shareholder
    dividends to its parent as long as the amount of such dividends,
    when aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months, does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year.
    MICC will be permitted to pay a cash dividend in excess of the
    greater of such two amounts only if it files notice of its
    declaration of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the
    Connecticut Commissioner of Insurance (the “Connecticut
    Commissioner”) and the Connecticut Commissioner does not
    disapprove the payment within 30 days after notice. In
    addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (unassigned
    funds, reduced by 25% of unrealized appreciation in value or
    revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments) as
    of the last filed annual statutory statement requires insurance
    regulatory approval. Under Connecticut State Insurance Law, the
    Connecticut Commissioner has broad discretion in determining
    whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance
    company would support the payment of such dividends to its
    shareholders. The Connecticut State Insurance Law requires prior
    approval for any dividends for a period of two years following a
    change in control. As a result of the acquisition of MICC by the
    Holding Company on July 1, 2005, under Connecticut State
    Insurance Law, all dividend payments by MICC through
    June 30, 2007 required prior approval of the Connecticut
    Commissioner.

Under Delaware State Insurance Law, Metropolitan Tower Life
    Insurance Company is permitted, without prior insurance
    regulatory clearance, to pay a stockholder dividend to the
    Holding Company as long as the amount of the dividend when
    aggregated with all other dividends in the preceding
    12 months does not exceed the greater of: (i) 10% of
    its surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) its statutory net gain
    from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year
    (excluding realized capital gains). MTL will be permitted to pay
    a cash dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the greater
    of such two amounts only if it files notice of the declaration
    of such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Delaware
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Delaware
    Commissioner”) and the Delaware Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    In addition, any dividend that exceeds earned surplus (defined
    as unassigned funds) as of the last filed annual statutory
    statement requires insurance regulatory approval. Under Delaware
    State Insurance Law, the Delaware Commissioner has broad
    discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a
    stock life insurance company would support the payment of such
    dividends to its shareholders.

Under Rhode Island State Insurance Law, MPC is permitted,
    without prior insurance regulatory clearance, to pay a
    stockholder dividend to the Holding Company as long as the
    aggregate amount of all such dividends in any twelve-month
    period does not exceed the lesser of: (i) 10% of its
    surplus to policyholders as of the end of the immediately
    preceding calendar year; or (ii) net income, not including
    realized capital gains, for the immediately preceding calendar
    year, which may include carry forward net income from the second
    and third preceding calendar years excluding realized capital
    gains and less dividends paid in the second and immediately
    preceding calendar years. MPC will be permitted to pay a cash
    dividend to the Holding Company in excess of the lesser of such
    two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare
    such a dividend and the amount thereof with the Rhode Island
    Commissioner of Insurance (the “Rhode Island
    Commissioner”) and the Rhode Island Commissioner does not
    disapprove the distribution within 30 days of its filing.
    Under Rhode Island State Insurance Code, the Rhode Island
    Commissioner has broad discretion in determining whether the
    financial condition of a stock property and casualty insurance
    company would support the payment of such dividends to its
    shareholders. MPC may not pay any dividends in 2009 without
    prior regulatory approval for dividend payments with payment
    dates prior to December 12, 2009. Subsequent to
    December 12, 2009, MPC can pay dividends totaling
    $9 million without requiring regulatory approval from the
    Rhode Island Commissioner.

Restructuring
    Charges

The Company has initiated an enterprise-wide cost reduction and
    revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative is focused on
    reducing complexity, leveraging scale, increasing productivity,
    and improving the effectiveness of the Company’s
    operations, as well as providing a foundation for future growth.
    During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a
    severance-related restructuring charge of $73 million
    associated with the termination of certain employees in
    connection with this enterprise-wide initiative. During the
    fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded further severance
    related restructuring costs of $36 million offset by an
    $8 million reduction to its third quarter restructuring
    charge attributable to lower than anticipated costs for variable
    incentive compensation and for employees whose severance status
    changed. Severance costs of $15 million were paid during
    the fourth quarter of 2008. Total restructuring charges incurred
    in connection with this enterprise-wide initiative during the
    year ended December 31, 2008 were $101 million and
    were reflected within Corporate & Other. Estimated
    restructuring costs may change as management continues to
    execute its restructuring plans. Restructuring charges
    associated with this enterprise-wide initiative were as follows:

Management anticipates further restructuring charges including

    the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. However, such
    restructuring plans are not sufficiently developed to enable the
    Company to make an estimate of such restructuring charges at
    December 31, 2008.

In addition to the restructuring charges incurred in connection
    with the aforementioned enterprise-wide initiative, the Company
    also incurred severance costs in connection with the Argentine
    government’s nationalization of the its private pension
    business. The Company recognized a restructuring charge of
    $15 million within the International segment during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and made payments of $12 million
    resulting in a restructuring liability of $3 million at
    December 31, 2008.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a
    cumulative out-of-period adjustment in connection with the
    exclusion of certain derivative gains from the estimation of
    cumulative gross profits used in the determination of DAC
    amortization. The adjustment decreased deferred policy
    acquisition costs and increased DAC amortization by
    $124 million and decreased net income by $80 million
    in the fourth quarter of 2008. Had the amounts been reflected
    during the first, second and third quarters of 2008 —
    in the periods in which they arose — DAC amortization
    would have increased (decreased) by $100 million,
    ($61) million, and $85 million, respectively,
    resulting in an increase (decrease) of net income by
    ($65) million, $40 million and ($55) million,
    respectively. Net income available to common shareholders per
    diluted common share would have been higher (lower) by ($0.09),
    $0.06, ($0.08) and $0.10 during the first, second, third and
    fourth quarters, respectively, of 2008 had the amounts been
    reflected in the periods in which they arose. Based upon an
    evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors,
    and after considering the provisions of APB Opinion No. 28,

Interim Financial Reporting

, paragraph 29,
    SAB No. 99,

Materiality

, and SAB 108,
    management believes this correcting adjustment was not material
    to the Company’s full year results for 2008 or the trend of
    earnings.

Business
    Segment Information

The Company is a leading provider of individual insurance,
    employee benefits and financial services with operations
    throughout the United States and the regions of Latin America,
    Asia Pacific, and Europe. Subsequent to the disposition of RGA
    and the elimination of the Reinsurance segment as described in
    Notes 2 and 23, the Company’s business is divided into
    four operating segments: Institutional, Individual,
    International, and Auto & Home, as well as
    Corporate & Other. These segments are managed
    separately because they either provide different products and
    services, require different strategies or have different
    technology requirements.

Institutional offers a broad range of group insurance and
    retirement & savings products and services, including
    group life insurance, non-medical health insurance, such as
    short and long-term disability, long-term care, and dental
    insurance, and other insurance products and services. Individual
    offers a wide variety of protection and asset accumulation
    products, including life insurance, annuities and mutual funds.
    International provides life insurance, accident and health
    insurance, annuities and retirement & savings products
    to both individuals and groups. Auto & Home provides
    personal lines property and casualty insurance, including
    private passenger automobile, homeowners and personal excess
    liability insurance.

Corporate & Other contains the excess capital not
    allocated to the business segments, various

start-up

entities, MetLife Bank and run-off entities, as well as interest
    expense related to the majority of the Company’s
    outstanding debt and expenses associated with certain legal
    proceedings and income tax audit issues. Corporate &
    Other also includes the elimination of all intersegment amounts,
    which generally relate to intersegment loans, which bear
    interest rates commensurate with related borrowings, as well as
    intersegment transactions. The operations of RGA are also
    reported in Corporate & Other as discontinued
    operations. Additionally, the Company’s asset management
    business, including amounts reported as discontinued operations,
    is included in the results of operations for
    Corporate & Other. See Note 23 for disclosures
    regarding discontinued operations, including real estate.

Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model,
    the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and
    to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic
    capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the
    risks inherent in MetLife’s businesses. As a part of the
    economic capital process, a portion of net investment income is
    credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Set forth in the tables below is certain financial information
    with respect to the Company’s segments, as well as
    Corporate & Other, for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The accounting policies
    of the segments are the same as those of the Company, except for
    the method of capital allocation and the accounting for gains
    (losses) from intercompany sales, which are eliminated in

Net investment income and net investment gains (losses) are
    based upon the actual results of each segment’s
    specifically identifiable asset portfolio adjusted for allocated
    equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based
    upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs;
    (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee
    compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost
    estimates included in the Company’s product pricing.

Revenues derived from any customer did not exceed 10% of
    consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006. Revenues from U.S. operations were
    $44.6 billion, $41.7 billion and $38.4 billion
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, which represented 87%, 88% and 90%, respectively,
    of consolidated revenues.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company sold its Peter Cooper
    Village and Stuyvesant Town properties located in Manhattan, New
    York for $5.4 billion. The Peter Cooper Village and
    Stuyvesant Town properties together make up the largest
    apartment complex in Manhattan, New York totaling over
    11,000 units, spread over 80 contiguous acres. The
    properties were owned by the Company’s subsidiary, MTL. Net
    investment income on these properties was $73 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The sale resulted in a
    gain of $3 billion, net of income tax.

Operations

As more fully described in Note 2, on September 12,
    2008, the Company completed a tax-free split-off of its
    majority-owned subsidiary, RGA. As a result of the disposition,
    the Reinsurance segment was eliminated. (See also Note 22).
    RGA’s assets and liabilities were reclassified to assets
    and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale and its operating
    results were reclassified to discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. Interest on economic capital associated with
    the Reinsurance segment has been reclassified to the continuing
    operations of Corporate & Other.

The operations of RGA include direct policies and reinsurance
    agreements with MetLife and some of its subsidiaries. These
    agreements are generally terminable by either party upon
    90 days written notice with respect to future new business.
    Agreements related to existing business generally are not
    terminable, unless the underlying policies terminate or are
    recaptured. These direct policies and reinsurance agreements do
    not constitute significant continuing involvement by the Company
    with RGA. Included in continuing operations in the
    Company’s consolidated statements of operations are amounts
    related to these transactions, including ceded amounts that
    reduced premiums and fees by $158 million,
    $251 million and $228 million and ceded amounts that
    reduced policyholder benefits and claims by $136 million,
    $290 million and $207 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively that have
    not been eliminated as these transactions are expected to
    continue after the RGA disposition. Related amounts included in
    the Company’s consolidated balance sheets include assets
    totaling $805 million, and liabilities totaling
    $542 million at December 31, 2007.

On August 31, 2007, MetLife Insurance Limited
    (“MetLife Australia”) completed the sale of its
    annuities and pension businesses to a third party for
    $25 million in cash consideration resulting in a gain upon
    disposal of $41 million, net of income tax, which was
    adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2007 for additional
    transaction costs. The Company reclassified the assets and
    liabilities of the annuities and pension businesses within
    MetLife Australia, which is reported in the International
    segment, to assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale
    and the operations of the business to discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. Included within the assets to be sold
    were certain fixed maturity securities in a loss position for
    which the Company recognized a net investment loss on a
    consolidated basis of $59 million, net of income tax, for
    the year ended December 31, 2007, because the Company no
    longer had the intent to hold such securities.

On January 31, 2005, the Company completed the sale of SSRM
    Holdings, Inc. to a third party for $328 million in cash
    and stock. The Company reported the operations of SSRM in
    discontinued operations. Under the terms of the sale agreement,
    MetLife had an opportunity to receive additional payments based
    on, among other things, certain revenue retention and growth
    measures. The purchase price was also subject to reduction over
    five years, depending on retention of certain MetLife-related
    business. In the second quarter of 2008, the Company paid
    $3 million, net of income tax, of which $2 million was
    accrued in the fourth quarter of 2007, related to the
    termination of certain MetLife-related business. Also under the
    terms of such agreement, MetLife had the opportunity to receive
    additional consideration for the retention of certain customers
    for a specific period in 2005. Upon finalization of the
    computation, the Company received a payment of $30 million,
    net of income tax, in the second quarter of 2006 due to the
    retention of these specific customer accounts. In the first
    quarter of 2007, the Company received a payment of
    $16 million, net of income tax, as a result of the revenue
    retention and growth measure provision in the sales agreement.
    In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company eliminated
    $4 million of a liability that was previously recorded with
    respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale
    of SSRM, resulting in a benefit to the Company of
    $2 million, net of income tax. The Company believes that
    future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable.

The following table presents the amounts related to operations
    of SSRM that have been reflected as discontinued operations in

Fair
    Value

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

As described in Note 1, the Company prospectively adopted
    the provisions of SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008.
    As a result, the methodologies used to determine the estimated
    fair value for certain financial instruments at
    December 31, 2008 may have been modified from those
    utilized at December 31, 2007, which, while being deemed
    appropriate under existing accounting guidance, may not have
    produced an exit value as defined in SFAS 157.

F-148


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Accordingly, the estimated fair value of financial instruments,
    and the description of the methodologies used to derive those
    estimated fair values, are presented separately at
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2008. Considerable
    judgment is often required in interpreting market data to
    develop estimates of fair value and the use of different
    assumptions or valuation methodologies may have a material
    effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Trading
    Securities

— The estimated fair values of publicly
    held fixed maturity securities and publicly held equity
    securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from
    independent pricing services. However, in cases where quoted
    market prices are not available, such as for private fixed
    maturity securities, fair values are estimated using present
    value or valuation techniques. The determination of estimated
    fair values is based on: (i) market standard valuation
    methodologies; (ii) securities the Company deems to be
    comparable; and (iii) assumptions deemed appropriate given
    the circumstances. The value estimates based on available market
    information and judgments about financial instruments, including
    estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash
    flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty.
    Factors considered in estimating fair value include; coupon
    rate, maturity, estimated duration, call provisions, sinking
    fund requirements, credit rating, industry sector of the issuer,
    and quoted market prices of comparable securities.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans, Mortgage Loan Commitments and
    Commitments to Fund Bank Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans,
    and Private Corporate Bond Investments

— Fair
    values for mortgage and consumer loans are estimated by
    discounting expected future cash flows, using current interest
    rates for similar loans with similar credit risk. For mortgage
    loan commitments and commitments to fund bank credit facilities,
    bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments the
    estimated fair value is the net premium or discount of the
    commitments.

Policy Loans

— The estimated fair values for
    policy loans approximate carrying values.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term
    Investments

— The estimated fair values for cash
    and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate
    carrying values due to the short-term maturities of these
    instruments.

Accrued Investment Income

— The estimated fair
    value for accrued investment income approximates carrying value.

Policyholder Account Balances

— The fair value
    of policyholder account balances which have final contractual
    maturities are estimated by discounting expected future cash
    flows based upon interest rates currently being offered for
    similar contracts with maturities consistent with those
    remaining for the agreements being valued. The estimated fair
    value of policyholder account balances without final contractual
    maturities are assumed to equal their current net surrender
    value.

Short-term and Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing
    Arrangements, Junior Subordinated Debt
    Securities

— The estimated fair values of
    short-term and long-term debt, collateral financing arrangements
    and junior subordinated debt securities are determined by
    discounting expected future cash flows using risk rates
    currently available for debt with similar terms and remaining
    maturities.

Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

— The estimated fair value for
    payables for collateral under securities loaned and other
    transactions approximates carrying value.

Assets and Liabilities of Subsidiaries
    Held-For-Sale

— The carrying values of assets and
    liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale reflect those assets
    and liabilities which were previously determined to be financial
    instruments and which were reflected in other financial
    statement captions in the table above in previous periods but
    have been reclassified to this caption to reflect the
    discontinued nature of the operations. The estimated fair value
    of the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale have
    been determined on a basis consistent with similar instruments
    as described herein.

Derivative Financial Instruments

— The
    estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments,
    including financial futures, financial forwards, interest rate,
    credit default and foreign currency swaps, foreign currency
    forwards, caps, floors, and options are based upon quotations
    obtained from dealers or other reliable sources. See Note 4
    for derivative fair value disclosures.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
    financial instruments are summarized as follows:

Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Trading
    Securities

— When available, the estimated fair
    value of the Company’s fixed maturity, equity and trading
    securities are based on quoted prices in active markets that are
    readily and regularly obtainable. Generally, these are the most
    liquid of the Company’s securities holdings and valuation
    of these securities does not involve management judgment.

When quoted prices in active markets are not available, the
    determination of estimated fair value is based on market
    standard valuation methodologies. The market standard valuation
    methodologies utilized include: discounted cash flow
    methodologies, matrix pricing or other similar techniques. The
    assumptions and inputs in applying these market standard
    valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to:
    interest rates, credit standing of the issuer or counterparty,
    industry sector of the issuer, coupon rate, call provisions,
    sinking fund requirements, maturity, estimated duration and
    management’s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated
    future cash flows. Accordingly, the estimated fair values are
    based on available market information and management’s
    judgments about financial instruments.

The significant inputs to the market standard valuation
    methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable
    levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Such observable inputs include
    benchmarking prices for similar assets in active, liquid
    markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and
    observable yields and spreads in the market.

When observable inputs are not available, the market standard
    valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value
    of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and
    therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable
    inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or
    estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market
    activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on
    assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and
    consistent with what other market participants would use when
    pricing such securities.

The use of different methodologies, assumptions and inputs may
    have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the
    Company’s securities holdings.

Mortgage and Consumer Loans —

The Company
    originates mortgage and consumer loans for both investment
    purposes and with the intention to sell them to third parties.
    Commercial and agricultural loans are originated for investment
    purposes and are primarily carried at amortized cost within the
    consolidated financial statements. Loans classified as consumer
    loans are generally purchased from third parties for investment
    purposes and are primarily carried at amortized cost. Mortgage
    loans held-for-sale consist principally of residential mortgage
    loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option
    and which are carried at estimated fair value in the
    consolidated financial statements and to a significantly lesser
    degree certain loans which were previously held-for-investment
    but

F-152


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

where the Company has changed its intention as it relates to
    holding them for investment. The estimated fair values of these
    loans are determined as follows:

•

Mortgage and Consumer Loans
    Held-for-Investment

— For mortgage and consumer
    loans held-for-investment and carried at amortized cost, fair
    value is primarily determined by estimating expected future cash
    flows and discounting them using current interest rates for
    similar loans with similar credit risk.

•

Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale —

Mortgage loans
    held-for-sale principally includes residential mortgages for
    which the fair value option was elected and which are carried at
    estimated fair value. Generally, quoted market prices are not
    available for residential mortgage loans held-for-sale;
    accordingly, the estimated fair values of such assets are
    determined based on observable pricing of residential mortgage
    loans held-for-sale with similar characteristics, or observable
    pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans,
    adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices. When
    observable pricing for similar loans or securities that are
    backed by similar loans are not available, the estimated fair
    values of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are
    determined using independent broker quotations, which is
    intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from
    third parties. Certain other mortgages previously classified as
    held-for-investment have also been designated as held-for-sale.
    For these loans, estimated fair value is determined using
    independent broker quotations or, when the loan is in
    foreclosure or otherwise determined to be collateral dependent,
    the fair value of the underlying collateral estimated using
    internal models.

Policy Loans —

For policy loans with fixed
    interest rates, estimated fair values are determined using a
    discounted cash flow model applied to groups of similar policy
    loans determined by the nature of the underlying insurance
    liabilities. Cash flow estimates are developed applying a
    weighted-average interest rate to the outstanding principal
    balance of the respective group of loans and an estimated
    average maturity determined through experience studies of the
    past performance of policyholder repayment behavior for similar
    loans. These cash flows are discounted using current risk-free
    interest rates with no adjustment for borrower credit risk as
    these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value
    of the underlying insurance policy. The estimated fair value for
    policy loans with variable interest rates approximates carrying
    value due to the absence of borrower credit risk and the short
    time period between interest rate resets, which presents minimal
    risk of a material change in estimated fair value due to changes
    in market interest rates.

Real Estate Joint Ventures and Other Limited Partnership
    Interests

— Other limited partnerships and real
    estate joint ventures included in the preceding table consist of
    those investments accounted for using the cost method. The
    remaining carrying value recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheet represents investments in real estate or real estate joint
    ventures and other limited partnerships accounted for using the
    equity method, which do not satisfy the definition of financial
    instruments for which fair value is required to be disclosed.

The estimated fair values for other limited partnership
    interests and real estate joint ventures accounted for under the
    cost method are generally based on the Company’s share of
    the net asset value (“NAV”) as provided in the
    financial statements of the investees. In certain circumstances,
    management may adjust the net asset value by a premium or
    discount when it has sufficient evidence to support applying
    such adjustments.

Short-term Investments

— Certain short-term
    investments do not qualify as securities and are recognized at
    amortized cost in the consolidated balance sheet. For these
    instruments, the Company believes that there is minimal risk of
    material changes in interest rates or credit of the issuer such
    that estimated fair value approximates carrying value. In light
    of recent market conditions, short-term investments have been
    monitored to ensure there is sufficient demand and maintenance
    of issuer credit quality and the Company has determined
    additional adjustment is not required. Short-term investments
    that meet the definition of a security are recognized at
    estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet in the
    same manner described above for similar instruments that are
    classified within captions of other major investment classes.

Other Invested Assets

— Other invested assets
    in the consolidated balance sheet is principally comprised of
    freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values,
    leveraged leases, investments in tax credit partnerships,

F-153


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

joint venture investments, mortgage servicing rights, investment
    in a funding agreement, funds withheld at interest and various
    interest-bearing assets held in foreign subsidiaries. Leveraged
    leases and investments in tax credit partnerships and joint
    ventures, which are accounted for under the equity method, are
    not financial instruments subject to fair value disclosure.
    Accordingly, they have been excluded from the preceding table.

The estimated fair value of derivatives — with
    positive and negative estimated fair values — is
    described in the respectively labeled section which follows.

Although mortgage servicing rights are not financial
    instruments, the Company has included them in the preceding
    table as a result of its election to carry mortgage servicing
    rights at fair value pursuant to SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

, as amended by
    SFAS No. 156,

Accounting for Servicing of Financial
    Assets

. As sales of mortgage servicing rights tend to occur
    in private transactions where the precise terms and conditions
    of the sales are typically not readily available, observable
    market valuations are limited. As such, the Company relies
    primarily on a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair
    value of the mortgage servicing rights. The model requires
    inputs such as type of loan (fixed vs. variable and agency vs.
    other), age of loan, loan interest rates and current market
    interest rates that are generally observable. The model also
    requires the use of unobservable inputs including assumptions
    regarding estimates of discount rates, loan pre-payment, and
    servicing costs.

The fair value of the investment in a funding agreement is
    estimated discounting the expected future cash flows using
    current market rates and the credit risk of the note issuer.

For funds withheld at interest and the various interest-bearing
    assets held in foreign subsidiaries, the Company evaluates the
    specific facts and circumstances of each instrument to determine
    the appropriate estimated fair values. These estimated fair
    values were not materially different from the recognized
    carrying values.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

— Due to the
    short-term maturities of cash and cash equivalents, the Company
    believes there is minimal risk of material changes in interest
    rates or credit of the issuer such that estimated fair value
    generally approximates carrying value. In light of recent market
    conditions, cash and cash equivalent instruments have been
    monitored to ensure there is sufficient demand and maintenance
    of issuer credit quality, or sufficient solvency in the case of
    depository institutions, and the Company has determined
    additional adjustment is not required.

Accrued Investment Income

— Due to the
    short-term until settlement of accrued investment income, the
    Company believes there is minimal risk of material changes in
    interest rates or credit of the issuer such that estimated fair
    value approximates carrying value. In light of recent market
    conditions, the Company has monitored the credit quality of the
    issuers and has determined additional adjustment is not required.

Premiums and Other Receivables —

Premiums and
    other receivables in the consolidated balance sheet is
    principally comprised of premiums due and unpaid for insurance
    contracts, amounts recoverable under reinsurance contracts,
    amounts on deposit with financial institutions to facilitate
    daily settlements related to certain derivative positions,
    amounts receivable for securities sold but not yet settled, fees
    and general operating receivables, and embedded derivatives
    related to the ceded reinsurance of certain variable annuity
    riders.

Premiums receivable and those amounts recoverable under
    reinsurance treaties determined to transfer sufficient risk are
    not financial instruments subject to disclosure and thus have
    been excluded from the amounts presented in the preceding table.
    Amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts which the
    Company has determined do not transfer sufficient risk such that
    they are accounted for using the deposit method of accounting
    have been included in the preceding table with the estimated
    fair value determined as the present value of expected future
    cash flows under the related contracts discounted using an
    interest rate determined to reflect the appropriate credit
    standing of the assuming counterparty.

The amounts on deposit for derivative settlements essentially
    represent the equivalent of demand deposit balances such that
    the estimated fair value approximates carrying value. In light
    of recent market conditions, the

F-154


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Company has monitored the solvency position of the financial
    institutions and has determined additional adjustments are not
    required.

Embedded derivatives recognized in connection with ceded
    reinsurance of certain variable annuity riders are included in
    this caption in the consolidated financial statements but
    excluded from this caption in the preceding table as they are
    separately presented.

Other Assets

— Other assets in the consolidated
    balance sheet is principally comprised of prepaid expenses,
    amounts held under corporate owned life insurance, fixed assets,
    capitalized software, deferred sales inducements, VODA, VOCRA,
    and a receivable for cash collateral pledged under the MRC
    collateral financing arrangement as described in Note 11.
    With the exception of the receivable for collateral pledged,
    other assets are not considered financial instruments subject to
    disclosure. Accordingly, the amount presented in the preceding
    table represent the receivable for collateral pledged for which
    the estimated fair value was determined by discounting the
    expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects
    the credit of the financial institution.

Separate Account Assets —

Separate account
    assets are carried at estimated fair value and reported as a
    summarized total on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance
    with Statement of Position (“SOP”)

03-1,

Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain
    Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts

(“SOP 03-1”).

The estimated fair values of separate account assets are based
    on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets owned by
    the separate account. Assets within the Company’s separate
    accounts include: mutual funds, fixed maturity securities,
    equity securities, mortgage loans, derivatives, hedge funds,
    other limited partnership interests, short-term investments and
    cash and cash equivalents. The estimated fair value of mutual
    funds is based upon quoted prices or reported net assets values
    provided by the fund manager and are reviewed by management to
    determine whether such values require adjustment to represent
    exit value. The estimated fair values of fixed maturity
    securities, equity securities, derivatives, short-term
    investments and cash and cash equivalents held by separate
    accounts are determined on a basis consistent with the
    methodologies described herein for similar financial instruments
    held within the general account. The estimated fair value of
    hedge funds is based upon NAVs provided by the fund manager and
    are reviewed by management to determine whether such values
    require adjustment to represent exit value. The estimated fair
    value of mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected
    future cash flows, using current interest rates for similar
    loans with similar credit risk. Other limited partnership
    interests are valued giving consideration to the value of the
    underlying holdings of the partnerships and by applying a
    premium or discount, if appropriate, for factors such as
    liquidity, bid/ask spreads, the performance record of the fund
    manager or other relevant variables which may impact the exit
    value of the particular partnership interest.

Policyholder Account Balances

— Policyholder
    account balances in the table above include investment contracts
    and customer bank deposits. Embedded derivatives on investment
    contracts and certain variable annuity riders accounted for as
    embedded derivatives are included in this caption in the
    consolidated financial statements but excluded from this caption
    in the table above as they are separately presented therein. The
    remaining difference between the amounts reflected as
    policyholder account balances in the preceding table and those
    recognized in the consolidated balance sheet represents those
    amounts due under contracts that satisfy the definition of
    insurance contracts and are not considered financial instruments.

The investment contracts primarily include guaranteed investment
    contracts, certain funding arrangements, fixed deferred
    annuities, modified guaranteed annuities, fixed term payout
    annuities, and total control accounts. The fair values for these
    investment contracts are estimated by discounting best estimate
    future cash flows using current market risk-free interest rates
    and adding a spread for the Company’s own credit determined
    using market standard swap valuation models and observable
    market inputs that take into consideration publicly available
    information relating to the Company’s debt as well as its
    claims paying ability.

Due to frequency of interest rate resets on customer bank
    deposits held in money market accounts, the Company believes
    that there is minimal risk of a material change in interest
    rates such that the estimated fair value

F-155


MetLife,
    Inc.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

approximates carrying value. For time deposits, estimated fair
    values are estimated by discounting the expected cash flows to
    maturity using a discount rate based on an average market rate
    for certificates of deposit being offered by a representative
    group of large financial institutions as of the date of the
    valuation.

Short-term and Long-term Debt, Collateral Financing
    Arrangements, and Junior Subordinated Debt

— The
    estimated fair value for short-term debt approximates carrying
    value due to the short-term nature of these obligations. The
    estimated fair values of long-term debt, collateral financing
    arrangements, and junior subordinated debt securities are
    generally determined by discounting expected future cash flows
    using market rates currently available for debt with similar,
    remaining maturities and reflecting the credit risk of the
    Company including inputs, when available, from actively traded
    debt of the Company or other companies with similar types of
    borrowing arrangements. Risk-adjusted discount rates applied to
    the expected future cash flows can vary significantly based upon
    the specific terms of each individual arrangement, including,
    but not limited to: subordinated rights; contractual interest
    rates in relation to current market rates; the structuring of
    the arrangement; and the nature and observability of the
    applicable valuation inputs. Use of different risk-adjusted
    discount rates could result in different estimated fair values.

The carrying value of long-term debt presented in the table
    above differs from the amounts presented in the consolidated
    balance sheet as it does not include capital leases which are
    not required to be disclosed at estimated fair value.

Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other
    Transactions

— The estimated fair value for
    payables for collateral under securities loaned and other
    transactions approximates carrying value. The related agreements
    to loan securities are short-term in nature such that Company
    believes there is limited risk of a material change in market
    interest rates. Additionally, because borrowers are
    cross-collateralized by the borrowed securities, the Company
    believes no additional consideration for changes in its own
    credit are necessary.

Other Liabilities

— Other liabilities in the
    consolidated balance sheet is principally comprised of
    freestanding derivatives with negative estimated fair values;
    securities trading liabilities; tax and litigation contingency
    liabilities; obligations for employee-related benefits; interest
    due on the Company’s debt obligations and on cash
    collateral held in relation to securities lending; dividends
    payable; amounts due for securities purchased but not yet
    settled; amounts due under assumed reinsurance contracts;
    minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries; and general
    operating accruals and payables.

The estimated fair value of derivatives — with
    positive and negative estimated fair values — is
    described in the respectively labeled section which follows.

The amounts included in the table above reflect those other
    liabilities that satisfy the definition of financial instruments
    subject to disclosure. These items consist primarily of
    securities trading liabilities; interest and dividends payable;
    amounts due for securities purchased but not yet settled; and
    amounts payable under certain assumed reinsurance contracts
    recognized using the deposit method of accounting. The Company
    evaluates the specific terms, facts and circumstances of each
    arrangement to determine the appropriate estimated fair values,
    which were not materially different from the recognized carrying
    values.

Separate Account Liabilities

— Separate account
    liabilities included in the table above represent those balances
    due to policyholders under contracts that are classified as
    investment contracts. The difference between the separate
    account liabilities reflected above and the amounts presented in
    the consolidated balance sheet represents those contracts
    classified as insurance contracts which do not satisfy the
    criteria of financial instruments for which fair value is to be
    disclosed.

Separate account liabilities classified as investment contracts
    primarily represent variable annuities with no significant
    mortality risk to the Company such that the death benefit is
    equal to the account balance; funding arrangements related to
    institutional group life contracts; and certain contracts that
    provide for benefit funding under Institutional retirement
    & savings products.

F-156


MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Separate account liabilities, whether related to investment or
    insurance contracts, are recognized in the consolidated balance
    sheet at an equivalent summary total of the separate account
    assets as prescribed by

SOP 03-1.

Separate account assets, which equal net deposits, net
    investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and
    losses, are fully offset by corresponding amounts credited to
    the contractholders’ liability which is reflected in
    separate account liabilities. Since separate account liabilities
    are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets
    which are recognized at estimated fair value as described above,
    the Company believes the value of those assets approximates the
    estimated fair value of the related separate account liabilities.

Derivatives —

The estimated fair value of
    derivatives is determined through the use of quoted market
    prices for exchange-traded derivatives and financial forwards to
    sell residential mortgage-backed securities or through the use
    of pricing models for over-the-counter derivatives. The
    determination of estimated fair value, when quoted market values
    are not available, is based on market standard valuation
    methodologies and inputs that are assumed to be consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing the
    instruments. Derivative valuations can be affected by changes in
    interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial
    indices, credit spreads, default risk (including the
    counterparties to the contract), volatility, liquidity and
    changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models.

The significant inputs to the pricing models for most
    over-the-counter derivatives are inputs that are observable in
    the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by
    observable market data. Significant inputs that are observable
    generally include: interest rates, foreign currency exchange
    rates, interest rate curves, credit curves and volatility.
    However, certain over-the-counter derivatives may rely on inputs
    that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not
    observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from
    or corroborated by observable market data. Significant inputs
    that are unobservable generally include: independent broker
    quotes, credit correlation assumptions, references to emerging
    market currencies and inputs that are outside the observable
    portion of the interest rate curve, credit curve, volatility or
    other relevant market measure. These unobservable inputs may
    involve significant management judgment or estimation. Even
    though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions
    deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with
    what other market participants would use when pricing such
    instruments.

The credit risk of both the counterparty and the Company are
    considered in determining the estimated fair value for all
    over-the-counter derivatives after taking into account the
    effects of netting agreements and collateral arrangements.
    Credit risk is monitored and consideration of any potential
    credit adjustment is based on net exposure by counterparty. This
    is due to the existence of netting agreements and collateral
    arrangements which effectively serve to mitigate risk. The
    Company values its derivative positions using the standard swap
    curve which includes a credit risk adjustment. This credit risk
    adjustment is appropriate for those parties that execute trades
    at pricing levels consistent with the standard swap curve. As
    the Company and its significant derivative counterparties
    consistently execute trades at such pricing levels, additional
    credit risk adjustments are not currently required in the
    valuation process. The need for such additional credit risk
    adjustments is monitored by the Company. The Company’s
    ability to consistently execute at such pricing levels is in
    part due to the netting agreements and collateral arrangements
    that are in place with all of its significant derivative
    counterparties.

Most inputs for over-the-counter derivatives are mid market
    inputs but, in certain cases, bid level inputs are used when
    they are deemed more representative of exit value. Market
    liquidity as well as the use of different methodologies,
    assumptions and inputs, may have a material effect on the
    estimated fair values of the Company’s derivatives and
    could materially affect net income.

Embedded Derivatives within Asset and Liability Host
    Contracts

— Embedded derivatives principally
    include certain direct, assumed and ceded variable annuity
    riders and certain guaranteed investment contracts with equity
    or bond indexed crediting rates. Embedded derivatives are
    recorded in the financial statements at estimated fair value
    with changes in estimated fair value adjusted through net income.

The Company issues certain variable annuity products with
    guaranteed minimum benefit riders. GMWB, GMAB and certain GMIB
    riders are embedded derivatives, which are measured at estimated
    fair value separately

    Statements — (Continued)

from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in
    estimated fair value reported in net investment gains (losses).
    These embedded derivatives are classified within policyholder
    account balances. The fair value for these riders is estimated
    using the present value of future benefits minus the present
    value of future fees using actuarial and capital market
    assumptions related to the projected cash flows over the
    expected lives of the contracts. A risk neutral valuation
    methodology is used under which the cash flows from the riders
    are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using
    observable risk free rates. Effective January 1, 2008, upon
    adoption of SFAS 157, the valuation of these riders now
    includes an adjustment for the Company’s own credit and
    risk margins for non-capital market inputs. The Company’s
    own credit adjustment is determined taking into consideration
    publicly available information relating to the Company’s
    debt as well as its claims paying ability. Risk margins are
    established to capture the non-capital market risks of the
    instrument which represent the additional compensation a market
    participant would require to assume the risks related to the
    uncertainties of such actuarial assumptions as annuitization,
    premium persistency, partial withdrawal and surrenders. The
    establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant
    management judgment. These riders may be more costly than
    expected in volatile or declining equity markets. Market
    conditions including, but not limited to, changes in interest
    rates, equity indices, market volatility and foreign currency
    exchange rates; changes in the Company’s own credit
    standing; and variations in actuarial assumptions regarding
    policyholder behavior and risk margins related to non-capital
    market inputs may result in significant fluctuations in the
    estimated fair value of the riders that could materially affect
    net income.

The Company ceded the risk associated with certain of the GMIB
    and GMAB riders described in the preceding paragraph. These
    reinsurance contracts contain embedded derivatives which are
    included in premiums and other receivables with changes in
    estimated fair value reported in net investments gains (losses)
    or policyholder benefit and claims depending on the income
    statement classification of the direct risk. The value of the
    embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a
    methodology consistent with that described previously for the
    riders directly written by the Company.

The estimated fair value of the embedded equity and bond indexed
    derivatives contained in certain guaranteed investment contracts
    is determined using market standard swap valuation models and
    observable market inputs, including an adjustment for the
    Company’s own credit that takes into consideration publicly
    available information relating to the Company’s debt as
    well as its claims paying ability. The estimated fair value of
    these embedded derivatives are included, along with their
    guaranteed investment contract host, within policyholder account
    balances with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net
    investment gains (losses). Changes in equity and bond indices,
    interest rates and the Company’s credit standing may result
    in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of these
    embedded derivatives that could materially affect net income.

The accounting for embedded derivatives is complex and
    interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to
    evolve in practice. If interpretations change, there is a risk
    that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation
    and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated
    financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair
    value could materially affect net income.

Assets and Liabilities of Subsidiaries
    Held-For-Sale

— The carrying value of the assets
    and liabilities of subsidiaries held-for-sale reflects those
    assets and liabilities which were previously determined to be
    financial instruments and which were reflected in other
    financial statement captions in the table above in previous
    periods but have been reclassified to this caption to reflect
    the discontinued nature of the operations. The estimated fair
    value of the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
    held-for-sale have been determined on a basis consistent with
    the asset type as described herein.

Mortgage Loan Commitments and Commitments to Fund Bank
    Credit Facilities, Bridge Loans, and Private Corporate Bond
    Investments —

The estimated fair values for
    mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund bank credit
    facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments
    reflected in the above table represent the difference between
    the discounted expected future cash flows using interest rates
    that incorporate current credit risk for similar instruments on
    the reporting date and the principal amounts of the original
    commitments.

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

The Company has categorized its assets and liabilities into the
    three-level fair value hierarchy, as defined in Note 1,
    based upon the priority of the inputs to the respective
    valuation technique. The following summarizes the types of
    assets and liabilities included within the three-level fair
    value hierarchy presented in the preceding table.

Level 1

This category includes certain U.S. Treasury and agency
    fixed maturity securities, certain foreign government fixed
    maturity securities; exchange-traded common stock; and certain
    short-term money market securities. As it relates to
    derivatives, this level includes financial futures including
    exchange-traded equity and interest rate futures, as well as
    financial forwards to sell residential mortgage-backed
    securities. Separate account assets classified within this level
    principally include mutual funds. Also included are assets held
    within separate accounts which are similar in nature to those
    classified in this level for the general account.

Level 2

This category includes fixed maturity and equity securities
    priced principally by independent pricing services using
    observable inputs. These fixed maturity securities include most
    U.S. Treasury and agency securities as well as the majority
    of U.S. and foreign corporate securities, residential
    mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed
    securities, state and political subdivision securities, foreign
    government securities, and asset-backed securities. Equity
    securities classified as Level 2 securities consist
    principally of non-redeemable preferred stock and certain equity
    securities where market quotes are available but are not
    considered actively traded. Short-term investments and trading
    securities included within Level 2 are of a similar nature
    to these fixed maturity and equity securities. Mortgage and
    consumer loans included in Level 2 include residential
    mortgage loans held-for-sale for which there is readily
    available observable pricing for similar loans or securities
    backed by similar loans and the unobservable adjustments to such
    prices are insignificant. As it relates to derivatives, this
    level includes all types of derivative instruments utilized by
    the Company with the exception of exchange-traded futures and
    financial forwards to sell residential mortgage-backed
    securities included within Level 1 and those derivative
    instruments with unobservable inputs as described in
    Level 3. Separate account assets classified within this
    level are generally similar to those classified within this
    level for the general account. Hedge funds owned by separate
    accounts are also included within this level. Embedded
    derivatives classified within this level include embedded equity
    derivatives contained in certain guaranteed investment contracts.

    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Level 3

This category includes fixed maturity securities priced
    principally through independent broker quotations or market
    standard valuation methodologies using inputs that are not
    market observable or cannot be derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data. This level consists of
    less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading
    activity or where less price transparency exists around the
    inputs to the valuation methodologies including: U.S. and
    foreign corporate securities — including below
    investment grade private placements; residential mortgage-backed
    securities; asset-backed securities — including all of
    those supported by sub-prime mortgage loans; and other fixed
    maturity securities such as structured securities. Equity
    securities classified as Level 3 securities consist
    principally of common stock of privately held companies and
    non-redeemable preferred stock where there has been very limited
    trading activity or where less price transparency exists around
    the inputs to the valuation. Short-term investments and trading
    securities included within Level 3 are of a similar nature
    to these fixed maturity and equity securities. Mortgage and
    consumer loans included in Level 3 include residential
    mortgage loans held-for-sale for which pricing for similar loans
    or securities backed by similar loans is not observable and the
    estimate of fair value is determined using unobservable broker
    quotes. As it relates to derivatives this category includes:
    financial forwards including swap spread locks with maturities
    which extend beyond observable periods; interest rate lock
    commitments with certain unobservable inputs, including
    pull-through rates; equity variance swaps with unobservable
    volatility inputs or that are priced via independent broker
    quotations; foreign currency swaps which are cancelable and
    priced through independent broker quotations; interest rate
    swaps with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion
    of the yield curve; credit default swaps based upon baskets of
    credits having unobservable credit correlations as well as
    credit default swaps with maturities which extend beyond the
    observable portion of the credit curves and credit default swaps
    priced through independent broker quotes; foreign currency
    forwards priced via independent broker quotations or with
    liquidity adjustments; equity options with unobservable
    volatility inputs; and interest rate caps and floors referencing
    unobservable yield curves

and/or

which
    include liquidity and volatility adjustments. Separate account
    assets classified within this level are generally similar to
    those classified within this level for the general account;
    however, they also include mortgage loans, and other limited
    partnership interests. Embedded derivatives classified within
    this level include embedded derivatives associated with certain
    variable annuity riders. This category also includes mortgage
    servicing rights which are carried at estimated fair value and
    have multiple significant unobservable inputs including discount
    rates, estimates of loan prepayments and servicing costs.

A rollforward of all assets and liabilities measured at
    estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant
    unobservable (Level 3) inputs for year ended
    December 31, 2008 is as follows:

Fair
    Value Option — Mortgage and Consumer
    Loans

The Company has elected fair value accounting for certain
    residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31,
    2008, the estimated fair value carrying amount of
    $1,975 million is greater than the aggregate unpaid
    principal amount of $1,920 million by $55 million.
    None of the loans where the fair value option has been elected
    are more than 90 days past due or in non-accrual status at
    December 31, 2008.

Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale accounted for under
    SFAS 159 are initially measured at estimated fair value.
    Gains and losses from initial measurement, subsequent changes in
    estimated fair value, and gains or losses on sales are
    recognized in other revenues. Interest income on residential
    mortgage loans held-for-sale is recorded based on the stated
    rate of the loan and is recorded in net investment income.

Changes in estimated fair value of $55 million have been
    included in the statement of income for residential mortgage
    loans held-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2008.

F-163


MetLife,

Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (Continued)

Changes in estimated fair value due to instrument-specific
    credit risk are estimated based on changes in credit spreads for
    non-agency loans and adjustments in individual loan quality, of
    which there were none for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Non-Recurring
    Fair Value Measurements

At December 31, 2008, the Company held $220 million in
    mortgage loans which are carried at estimated fair value based
    on independent broker quotations or, if the loans were in
    foreclosure or are otherwise determined to be collateral
    dependent, on the value of the underlying collateral of which
    $188 million was related to impaired mortgage loans
    held-for-investment and $32 million to certain mortgage
    loans held-for-sale. These impaired mortgage loans were recorded
    at estimated fair value and represent a nonrecurring fair value
    measurement. The estimated fair value was categorized as
    Level 3. Included within net investment gains (losses) for
    such impaired mortgage loans are net impairments of
    $79 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, the Company held $137 million in
    cost basis other limited partnership interests which were
    impaired during the year ended December 31, 2008 based on
    the underlying limited partnership financial statements. These
    other limited partnership interests were recorded at estimated
    fair value and represent a nonrecurring fair value measurement.
    The estimated fair value was categorized as Level 3.
    Included within net investment gains (losses) for such other
    limited partnerships are impairments of $105 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2008.

Subsequent
    Events

Dividends

On February 18, 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors
    announced dividends of $0.25 per share, for a total of
    $6 million, on its Series A preferred shares, and
    $0.40625 per share, for a total of $24 million, on its
    Series B preferred shares, subject to the final
    confirmation that it has met the financial tests specified in
    the Series A and Series B preferred shares, which the
    Company anticipates will be made on or about March 5, 2009,
    the earliest date permitted in accordance with the terms of the
    securities. Both dividends will be payable March 16, 2009
    to shareholders of record as of February 28, 2009.

Remarketing
    of Securities and Settlement of Stock Purchase Contracts
    Underlying Common Equity Units

On February 17, 2009, the Holding Company closed the
    successful remarketing of the Series B portion of the
    junior subordinated debentures underlying the common equity
    units. The junior subordinated debentures were modified as
    permitted by their terms to be 7.717% senior debt
    securities Series B, due February 15, 2019. The
    Holding Company did not receive any proceeds from the
    remarketing. Most common equity unit holders chose to have their
    junior subordinated debentures remarketed and used the
    remarketing proceeds to settle their payment obligations under
    the applicable stock purchase contract. For those common equity
    unit holders that elected not to participate in the remarketing
    and elected to use their own cash to satisfy the payment
    obligations under the stock purchase contract, the terms of the
    debt are the same as the remarketed debt.

The subsequent settlement of the stock purchase contracts
    occurred on February 17, 2009, providing proceeds to the
    Holding Company of $1,035 million in exchange for shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock. The Holding Company
    delivered 24,343,154 shares of its newly issued common
    stock to settle the remaining stock purchase contracts issued as
    part of the common equity units sold in June 2005.

Summary
    of Accounting Policies

Business

“MetLife” or the “Company” refers to
    MetLife, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1999 (the
    “Holding Company”), and its subsidiaries, including
    Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”). MetLife,
    Inc. is a leading provider of individual insurance, employee
    benefits and financial services with operations throughout the
    United States and the Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific
    regions. Through its subsidiaries and affiliates, MetLife offers
    life insurance, annuities, auto and home insurance, retail
    banking and other financial services to individuals, as well as
    group insurance and retirement & savings products and
    services to corporations and other institutions.

Basis
    of Presentation

The condensed financial information of the Holding Company
    (“Parent Company Only”) should be read in conjunction
    with the Consolidated Financial Statements of MetLife, Inc. and
    subsidiaries and the notes thereto (the “Consolidated
    Financial Statements”). These condensed nonconsolidated
    financial statements reflect the results of operations,
    financial position and cash flows for the parent company only.
    Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity
    method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
    (“APB”) Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of
    Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

.

The condensed unconsolidated financial statements are prepared
    in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
    the United States of America (“GAAP”) except as stated
    previously which also requires management to make certain
    estimates and assumptions. The most important of these estimates
    and assumptions relate to the fair value measurements, the
    accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and
    the provision for potential losses that may arise from
    litigation and regulatory proceedings and tax audits, which may
    affect the amounts reported in the condensed financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from these estimates.

Dispositions
    and Acquisition

Disposition
    of Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated

As more fully described in Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, on September 12, 2008,
    the Holding Company completed a tax-free split-off of its
    majority-owned subsidiary, Reinsurance Group of America,
    Incorporated (“RGA”). The Holding Company and RGA
    entered into a recapitalization and distribution agreement,
    pursuant to which the Holding Company agreed to divest
    substantially all of its 52% interest in RGA to the Holding
    Company’s stockholders. As a result of completion of the
    recapitalization and exchange offer, the Holding Company
    received from its’ stockholders 23,093,689 shares of
    the Holding Company’s common stock with a market value of
    $1,318 million and, in exchange, delivered
    29,243,539 shares of RGA’s Class B common stock
    with a net book value of $1,716 million. The transaction
    resulted in a loss of $398 million, which is included in
    equity in earnings of subsidiaries, and transaction costs of
    $60 million, which is included in other expenses.

Disposition
    of Texas Life Insurance Company

As more fully described in Note 2 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements, the Holding Company
    anticipates completing the sale of Cova Corporation
    (“Cova”), the parent company of Texas Life Insurance
    Company in early 2009. As a result of the sale agreement, the
    Holding Company recognized a tax benefit of $65 million
    relating to the excess of outside tax basis of Cova over its
    financial reporting basis.

    Acquisition

During 2008, the Holding Company made an acquisition for
    $202 million. Total consideration paid by the Holding
    Company for this acquisition consisted of $190 million in
    cash and $12 million in transaction costs. At
    December 31, 2008 the Holding Company held a receivable
    related to the settlement of this transaction of
    $3 million. The net fair value of assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed totaled $129 million which is included
    in investment in subsidiaries, resulting in goodwill of
    $70 million of which $22 million was contributed to a
    subsidiary of the Holding Company. The goodwill is deductible
    for tax purposes. During 2008, the Holding Company made a
    capital contribution of $97 million to its subsidiaries in
    the form of other intangible assets of $143 million, net of
    deferred taxes of $46 million, for which the subsidiaries
    receive the benefit of such assets.

    and Committed Facilities and Letters of Credit

Credit Facilities.

In December 2008, the
    Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc. entered into an
    amended and restated $2,850 million credit agreement (dated
    as of June 2007 and amended and restated at December 23,
    2008) with various financial institutions, the proceeds of
    which are available to be used for general corporate purposes,
    to support their commercial paper programs and for the issuance
    of letters of credit. All borrowings under the credit agreement
    must be repaid by June 2012, except that letters of credit
    outstanding upon termination may remain outstanding until June
    2013. The borrowers and the lenders under this facility may
    agree to extend the term of all or part of the facility to no
    later than June 2014, except that letters of credit outstanding
    upon termination may remain outstanding until June 2015. The
    Holding Company and MetLife Funding, Inc. incurred amendment
    costs of $11 million related to the $2,850 million
    amended and restated credit agreement, which have been
    capitalized and included in other assets. These costs will be
    amortized over the term of the agreement. The Holding Company
    did not have any deferred financing costs associated with the
    original June 2007 credit agreement.

At December 31, 2008, $2.3 billion of letters of
    credit have been issued under these unsecured credit facilities
    on behalf of the Holding Company.

These agreements contain various administrative, reporting,
    legal and financial covenants, including a consolidated net
    worth covenant. Management has no reason to believe that its
    lending counterparties are unable to fulfill their respective
    contractual obligations.

Letters of Credit.

At December 31, 2008,
    the Holding Company had outstanding $2.8 billion in letters
    of credit, substantially all of which are associated with the
    aforementioned credit facilities, from various financial
    institutions, of which $500 million and $2.3 billion
    were part of committed and credit facilities, respectively. As
    commitments associated with letters of credit and financing
    arrangements may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily
    reflect the Holding Company’s actual future cash funding
    requirements.

Related
    Party Transactions

Dividends

The primary source of the Holding Company’s liquidity is
    dividends it receives from its insurance subsidiaries. The
    Holding Company’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to
    regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by
    the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend
    limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is based on the
    surplus to policyholders as of the immediately preceding
    calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the
    immediately preceding calendar year. The maximum aggregate
    amount of dividends which the Holding Company subsidiaries may
    pay to the Holding Company in 2009 without insurance regulatory
    approval is $1,363 million.

Financing
    Arrangements Related to Subsidiaries

As described more fully in Note 11 of the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements:

•

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MetLife
    Reinsurance Company of Charleston’s (“MRC”)
    reinsurance of the closed block liabilities, entered into an
    agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under which
    the Holding Company is entitled to the interest paid by MRC on
    the surplus notes of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.55% in exchange for the payment of

3-month

LIBOR plus 1.12%, payable quarterly. Under this agreement, the
    Holding Company may also be required to pledge collateral or
    make payments to the unaffiliated financial institution related
    to any decline in the estimated fair value of the surplus notes
    and in connection with any early termination of this agreement.
    During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Holding
    Company paid $800 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution related to a decline in the estimated fair value of
    the surplus notes. This payment reduced the amount under the
    agreement on which the Holding Company’s interest payment
    is due but did not reduce the outstanding amount of the surplus
    notes. In addition, the Holding Company had pledged collateral
    of $230 million to the unaffiliated financial institution
    at

December 31, 2008. No collateral had been pledged at
    December 31, 2007. The Holding Company’s net cost of
    0.57% has been allocated to MRC. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, this amount was $14 million. For
    the year ended December 31, 2007, this amount was
    immaterial.

•

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, entered into
    an agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution under
    which the Holding Company is entitled to the return on the
    investment portfolio held by the trust established in connection
    with this collateral financing arrangement in exchange for the
    payment of a stated rate of return to the unaffiliated financial
    institution of

3-month

LIBOR plus 0.70%, payable quarterly. The Holding Company may
    also be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trust, as
    well as amounts outstanding upon maturity or early termination
    of the collateral financing arrangement. As a result of this
    agreement, the Holding Company effectively assumed the
    $2.4 billion liability under the collateral financing
    arrangement along with a beneficial interest in the trust
    holding the associated assets. The Holding Company
    simultaneously contributed to MRSC its beneficial interest in
    the trust, along with any return to be received on the
    investment portfolio held by the trust. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, the Holding Company paid
    $320 million to the unaffiliated financial institution as a
    result of the decline in the estimated fair value of the assets
    in the trust. All of the $320 million was deposited into
    the trust. In January 2009, the Holding Company paid an
    additional $360 million to the unaffiliated financial
    institution as a result of the continued decline in the
    estimated fair value of the assets in trust which was also
    deposited into the trust. In addition, the Holding Company may
    be required to pledge collateral to the unaffiliated financial
    institution under this agreement. At December 31, 2008, the
    Holding Company had pledged $86 million under the
    agreement. No collateral had been pledged under the agreement as
    December 31, 2007. Interest expense incurred by the Holding
    Company under the collateral financing arrangement for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $107 million and
    $84 million, respectively. The allocation of these
    financing costs to MRSC is included in other revenues and
    recorded as an additional investment in MRSC.

Support
    Agreements

In October 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with
    MRV’s reinsurance of certain universal life and term life
    insurance risks, committed to the Vermont Department of Banking,
    Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration to take
    necessary action to cause each of the two initial protected
    cells of MRV to maintain total adjusted capital equal to or
    greater than 200% of such protected cell’s authorized
    control level risk-based capital (“RBC”), as defined
    in state insurance statutes. This transaction is more fully
    described in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In December 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRC’s
    reinsurance of a portion of the liabilities associated with the
    closed block, committed to the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance to make capital contributions, if necessary, to MRC so
    that MRC may at all times maintain its total adjusted capital at
    a level of not less than 200% of the company action
    level RBC, as defined in state insurance statutes as in
    effect on the date of determination or December 31, 2007,
    whichever calculation produces the greater capital requirement,
    or as otherwise required by the South Carolina Department of
    Insurance. This collateral financing arrangement is more fully
    described in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

In May 2007, the Holding Company, in connection with the
    collateral financing arrangement associated with MRSC’s
    reinsurance of universal life secondary guarantees, committed to
    the South Carolina Department of Insurance to take necessary
    action to cause MRSC to maintain total adjusted capital equal to
    the greater of $250,000

F-175

or 100% of MRSC’s authorized control level RBC, as
    defined in state insurance statutes. This collateral financing
    arrangement is more fully described in Note 11 of the Notes
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Holding Company has net worth maintenance agreements with
    two of its insurance subsidiaries, MetLife Investors Insurance
    Company and First MetLife Investors Insurance Company. Under
    these agreements, as subsequently amended, the Holding Company
    agreed, without limitation as to the amount, to cause each of
    these subsidiaries to have a minimum capital and surplus of
    $10 million, total adjusted capital at a level not less
    than 150% of the company action level RBC, as defined by
    state insurance statutes, and liquidity necessary to enable it
    to meet its current obligations on a timely basis.

The Holding Company entered into a net worth maintenance
    agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo MetLife Insurance Company Limited
    (“MSMIC”), an investment in Japan of which the Holding
    Company owns 50% of the equity. Under the agreement, the Holding
    Company agreed, without limitation as to amount, to cause MSMIC
    to have the amount of capital and surplus necessary for MSMIC to
    maintain a solvency ratio of at least 400%, as calculated in
    accordance with the Insurance Business Law of Japan, and to make
    such loans to MSMIC as may be necessary to ensure that MSMIC has
    sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet its payment
    obligations as they fall due.

The Holding Company has guaranteed the obligations of its
    subsidiary, Exeter, under a reinsurance agreement with MSMIC
    under which Exeter reinsures variable annuities written by MSMIC.

Management anticipates that to the extent that these
    arrangements place significant demands upon the Holding Company,
    there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the
    Holding Company to meet these demands.

Fair

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The Holding Company prospectively adopted the provisions of
    SFAS 157 effective January 1, 2008. As a result, the
    methodologies used to determine the estimated fair value for
    certain financial instruments at December 31, 2008 may
    have been modified from those utilized at December 31,
    2007, which, while being deemed appropriate under existing
    accounting guidance, may not have produced an exit value as
    defined in SFAS 157. Accordingly, the estimated fair value
    of financial instruments, and the description of the
    methodologies used to derive those estimated fair values, are
    presented separately at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2008. Considerable judgment is often required
    in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value
    and the use of different assumptions or valuation methodologies
    may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

Loans to and Receivables from Subsidiaries

—
    The Holding Company lends funds, as necessary, to its
    subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital
    requirements. The estimated fair values are determined by
    discounting expected future cash flows using current market
    interest rates currently available for instruments with similar
    terms issued to companies of comparable credit quality of the
    respective subsidiaries.

Commitment Under Collateral Financing
    Arrangement

— The commitment under collateral
    financing arrangement is an off-balance sheet liability that
    represents the Holding Company’s obligation to potentially
    make additional payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution under the terms of the agreement entered into
    simultaneously with the issuance of surplus notes by MRC as
    discussed in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. The fair value of this commitment was
    estimated based on a valuation model similar to that used to
    value a credit default swap using inputs based on market data
    for issuers with credit ratings similar to MRC.

On January 28, 2009, the Holding Company made a
    $360 million payment to the unaffiliated financial
    institution related to the collateral financing arrangement for
    MRSC. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Holding Company
    may be required to make payments to the unaffiliated financial
    institution, for deposit into the trust, related to any decline
    in the estimated fair value of the assets held by the trust.

Controls
    and Procedures

Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the
    effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
    disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(e)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
    procedures are effective.

There were no changes to the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f)

during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting.

Management’s
    Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

Management of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for
    establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
    financial reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility,
    estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
    expected benefits and related costs of control procedures. The
    objectives of internal control include providing management with
    reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets are
    safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,
    and that transactions are executed in accordance with
    management’s authorization and recorded properly to permit
    the preparation of consolidated financial statements in

Attestation
    Report of the Company’s Registered Public Accounting
    Firm

The Company’s independent registered public accounting
    firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued their
    attestation report on management’s internal control over
    financial reporting which is set forth below.



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

MetLife, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    of the Company, and our report dated February 26, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedules and included an
    explanatory paragraph regarding changes in the Company’s
    method of accounting for certain assets and liabilities to a
    fair value measurement approach as required by accounting
    guidance adopted on January 1, 2008.

Item 9B.

Other
    Information

On February 24, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the
    Board of Directors of MetLife, Inc. approved special
    compensation grants (“Special Grants”) to William J.
    Wheeler, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief
    Financial Officer and Steven A. Kandarian, the Company’s
    Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. The
    Special Grants were approved in recognition of the critical
    nature of their roles at the Company, these executives’
    sustained high performance, and to encourage them to continue to
    provide a high level of performance that will create value for
    Company shareholders. The grants were in addition to grants
    determined under the Company’s general executive
    compensation practices. The Special Grants consisted of 130,000
    stock options and 64,000 performance shares for Mr. Wheeler
    and 120,000 stock options and 64,000 performance shares for
    Mr. Kandarian. The grants the Committee determined under
    the Company’s general executive compensation practices
    included 65,000 stock options and 32,000 performance shares for
    Mr. Wheeler, and 60,000 stock options and 32,000
    performance shares for Mr. Kandarian. The Special Grant
    stock options will normally become exercisable on the third
    anniversary of their grant date, rather than at a rate of
    one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of their
    grant date as do the stock options determined under the
    Company’s general executive compensation practices.
