ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real
estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. We focus on the development,
redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and operation of apartment communities in high
barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. This is because we believe that, long term, the
limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing affordability in these markets will result
in larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire business cycle. These
barriers-to-entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local
jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply.
Our markets are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern
and Southern California regions of the United States.

At February 28, 2005, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 138 operating
apartment communities containing 40,142 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia,
of which four communities containing 1,430 apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition,
we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in ten communities under construction that
are expected to contain an aggregate of 2,668 apartment homes when completed. We also owned a
direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an additional 49 communities that, if
developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 13,491 apartment homes. We generally
obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by
acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community. In selecting sites for
development, redevelopment or acquisition, we favor locations that are near expanding employment
centers and convenient to recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.

Our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments: Established Communities,
Other Stabilized Communities and Development/Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities
are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating
expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all
other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the
beginning of the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior
year. Development/Redevelopment Communities consist of communities that are under construction,
communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the
current year and communities under lease-up. A more detailed description of these segments and
other related information can be found in Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of the Consolidated
Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.

Our principal financial goal is to increase long-term stockholder value by successfully and
cost-effectively developing, redeveloping, acquiring, owning and operating high-quality communities
in our selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents, as well as by
providing our residents with efficient and effective service. To help fulfill this goal, we
regularly (i) monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type, (ii)
develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets with growing
or high potential for demand, (iii) selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our
long-term strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created
over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales, and (iv) endeavor to
maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such that we maintain
continuous access to cost-effective capital. Our long-term strategy is to deeply penetrate the
high barrier-to-entry markets in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and
an intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our current communities are upscale,
which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the
ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and
price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services.


During the three years ended December 31, 2004, we acquired seven apartment communities, disposed
of 17 apartment communities, and completed the development of 24 apartment communities and the
redevelopment of three apartment communities. In anticipation of continued improvement in
apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand, we have increased our development and
acquisition volume. During 2004, we increased our level of acquisition activity in preparation of
the closing of a discretionary investment fund. In addition, we continued to secure new
development opportunities, bringing our pipeline for potential development opportunities to a new
high. However, we continued with certain disposition activity when presented with opportunities to
realize value. In 2005, we expect to continue acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund,
particularly potential redevelopment communities, and to continue to be an opportunistic seller,
while increasing our development activity over 2004 levels. The level of development, acquisition
and disposition activity, however, is heavily influenced by capital market conditions, including
prevailing interest rates. A further discussion of our development, redevelopment, disposition and
acquisition strategy follows.

Development Strategy.

We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures
that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. As one of the largest
developers of multifamily apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United
States, we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local
market information achieved through our regional offices. In addition to our principal executive
offices in Alexandria, Virginia, we also maintain regional offices and administrative or specialty
offices in or near the following cities:

•

Boston, Massachusetts;

•

Chicago, Illinois;

•

New Canaan, Connecticut;

•

New York, New York;

•

Newport Beach, California;

•

San Jose, California;

•

Seattle, Washington; and

•

Woodbridge, New Jersey.

After selecting a target site, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either
through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options and long-term conditional contracts
generally enable us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction, which
reduces development-related risks as well as preserves capital. After we acquire land, we
generally shift our focus to construction. However, we will acquire and hold land where business
conditions warrant. Except for certain mid-rise and high-rise apartment communities where we may
elect to use third-party general contractors or construction managers, we act as our own general
contractor and construction manager. We generally perform these functions directly (and not
through a subsidiary) both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we
are a member or a partner. We believe this enables us to achieve higher construction quality,
greater control over construction schedules and significant cost savings. Our development,
property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure high-quality
workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operational phase.

Throughout this report, the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development
cycle, including pursuit of zoning approvals, procurement of architectural and engineering designs
and the construction process. References to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the
property, which is only one element of the development cycle.

Redevelopment Strategy

. When we undertake the redevelopment of a community, our goal is to
generally renovate and/or rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is
significantly below replacement cost and the community is one of the highest quality apartment
communities or best rental values for an apartment community in its local area. We have
established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment. Our redevelopment
teams, which include key redevelopment, construction and property management personnel, monitor
redevelopment progress. We believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own
general contractor. More importantly, this helps to ensure high-quality design and workmanship and
a smooth and timely transition into the lease-up and restabilization phase.


Throughout this report, the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment
cycle, including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs, budgeting and
actual renovation work. The actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction,” which is
only one element of the redevelopment cycle.

Disposition Strategy.

We sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the
proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our
portfolio across geographic regions. This also allows us to realize a portion of the value created
over the past business cycle, as well as provides additional liquidity. We are then able to
redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital
externally by issuing debt or equity securities. When we decide to sell a community, we generally
solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales
price of each proposal.

Acquisition Strategy.

Our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow
us to be selective in the acquisitions we target. From time to time, in order to achieve rapid
penetration into markets that are generally supply constrained and in which we desire an increased
presence and to help us achieve our desired product mix, or to rebalance our portfolio, we will
acquire existing apartment communities. Over the next several years, we expect to increase our
acquisition activity for a discretionary investment fund which we anticipate closing in early 2005,
particularly potential redevelopment opportunities.

Property Management Strategy

. We intend to increase operating income through innovative, proactive
property management that will result in higher revenue from communities and controlled operating
expenses.

Our principal strategies to maximize revenue include:

•

strong focus on resident satisfaction;

•

staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns;

•

balancing high occupancy with premium pricing, and increasing rents as market conditions permit;

•

managing community occupancy for optimal rental revenue levels; and

•

applying new technology to optimize revenue from each community.

Controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase earnings growth.
Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to
be spread over a larger volume of revenue, thereby increasing operating margins. We control
operating expenses as follows:

•

receive and approve invoices on-site to ensure careful monitoring of budgeted versus
actual expenses;

•

purchase supplies in bulk where possible;

•

bid third-party contracts on a volume basis;

•

strive to retain residents through high levels of service in order to eliminate the
cost of preparing an apartment home for a new resident and to reduce marketing and
vacant apartment utility costs;

•

perform turnover work in-house or hire third-parties, generally depending upon the
least costly alternative;

•

undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize resident satisfaction and
property and equipment life; and

•

aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals.

On-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net operating income
produced at their respective communities.

We generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly (and not through
a subsidiary) both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member
or a partner.

We are also pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources. In
general, as a REIT we cannot directly provide services to our tenants that are not customarily
provided by a landlord, nor can we share in the income of a third party that provides such
services. However, we can provide such non-customary services to residents if we do so through a
“taxable REIT subsidiary,” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “C corporation” and is
therefore subject to federal income taxes. We have used taxable REIT subsidiaries on a limited
basis, such as to receive a commission from a “preferred provider” vendor used by residents.


Technology Strategy.

We believe that an innovative management information system infrastructure is
an important element in managing our future growth. This is because timely and accurate collection
of financial and resident profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing
decisions and financial management.

Financing Strategy.

We have consistently maintained, and intend to continue to maintain, a capital
structure that is aligned to the business risks presented by our corporate strategy. At December
31, 2004, our debt-to-total market capitalization was 30.4%, and our long-term floating rate debt,
not including borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, was 2.6% of total market
capitalization. Total market capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our
common stock, the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding (based on the market
value of our common stock), the liquidation preference of our preferred stock and the outstanding
principal amount of our debt. We believe that debt-to-total market capitalization can be one
useful measure of a real estate operating company’s long-term liquidity and balance sheet strength,
because it shows an approximate relationship between a company’s total debt and the current total
market value of its assets based on the current price at which the company’s common stock trades.
However, because debt-to-total market capitalization changes with fluctuations in our stock price,
which occurs regularly, our debt-to-total market capitalization may change even when our earnings
and debt levels remain stable.

We estimate that a portion of our short-term liquidity needs will be met from retained operating
cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. If required to meet the
balance of our current or anticipated liquidity needs, we will attempt to arrange additional
capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility, sell existing communities or land and/or
issue additional debt or equity securities. A determination to engage in an equity or debt
offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions, including
interest rates, our short and long term liquidity needs, the adequacy of our expected liquidity
sources, the relative costs of debt and equity capital, and growth opportunities. A summary of
debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our Consolidated Statement of
Cash Flows of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.

While we believe we have the financial position to expand our short-term credit capacity and access
the capital markets as needed, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing these
arrangements, sales or offerings. The failure to complete these transactions on a cost-effective
basis or at all could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial
condition.

We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including
limited liability companies) or partnerships through which we would own an indirect economic
interest in less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint venture or
partnership. Our decision whether to hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an
indirect interest in the community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of
factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land
or of a community, who may prefer that (or who may require less payment if) the land or community
is contributed to a joint venture or partnership; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of
communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our
capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projection, in some
circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a
joint venture or partnership vehicle is used. Investments in joint ventures or partnerships are
not limited to a specified percentage of our assets. Each joint venture or partnership agreement
is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole
discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or
partnership agreement.

We have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the
formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities. This fund
would serve, for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until 80% of its
committed capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment
communities, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset
and portfolio acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that
are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund, if any. The fund would not restrict our development
activities and would terminate after a term of eight years, subject to two one-year extensions. As
of February 28, 2005, we have acquired four communities with the intent of being owned by the fund,
but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results. We are currently
targeting acquisitions for the fund where value


creation opportunities are present through one or more of the following: redevelopment activities,
market cycle opportunities or improved property operations. We expect the fund to have equity
commitments of up to $330,000,000 and the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to
65% on a portfolio basis, which would enable the fund to invest up to $940,000,000. We would
contribute 20% of the total equity up to $50,000,000. We expect closing on the equity funding
during the first quarter of 2005. There can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be
formed or, if formed, what its size, terms or investment performance will be.

The use of joint ventures and the discretionary investment fund described above creates risks for
us. For example, an investor or co-venturer could have economic or business interests or goals
that are inconsistent with our business and goals, could fail to fund capital commitments as
contractually required, or could fail to approve decisions we advise for which their approval may
be required, such as the timing of a sale of a property. In addition, when entering into a joint
venture or the discretionary investment fund we undertake fiduciary duties and reporting and other
obligations to co-venturers.

In addition, we may, from time to time, offer shares of our equity securities, debt securities or
options to purchase stock in exchange for property.

While we emphasize equity real estate investments in apartment communities, we have the ability,
which would be exercised in the discretion of our Board of Directors, to invest in other types of
real estate, mortgages (including participating or convertible mortgages), securities of other
REITs or real estate operating companies, or securities of technology companies that relate to our
real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents, in each case
consistent with our qualification as a REIT. On occasion, we own and operate retail space at our
communities when either (i) the highest and best use of the space is for retail (e.g., street level
in an urban area) or (ii) we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the
community to residents. As of December 31, 2004, we had a total of 331,384 square feet of rentable
retail space that produced gross rental revenue in 2004 of $3,383,000 (0.5% of total revenue). Any
investment in securities of other entities is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations
and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification.

We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other
issuers and do not intend to do so. At all times we intend to make investments in a manner as to
qualify as a REIT unless, because of circumstances or changes to the Internal Revenue Code (or the
Treasury Regulations), the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest
to qualify as a REIT.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which may enable us to realize
increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Such short-term
leases generally minimize the risk to us of the adverse effects of inflation, although as a general
rule these leases permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore our rental
revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer
terms. Short-term leases combined with relatively consistent demand have allowed rents, and
therefore cash flow from the portfolio, to provide an attractive inflation hedge. However, in a
deflationary rent environment, as experienced over the last several years, we are exposed to
declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

Tax Matters

We filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in
the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under federal and
certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is
distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at
the corporate level. While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend
to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no
assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Qualification as a REIT involves the
application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there
are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety
of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.


Competition

We face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and
investment funds, partnerships and investment companies and other apartment REITs, to acquire and
develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development. As an owner and operator of
apartment communities, we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators
whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may
be perceived as a better value proposition given the quality, location and amenities that the
resident seeks. We also compete with the condominium and single-family home markets. Although we
often compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities
and for prospective residents, real estate developers and operators of any size can provide
effective competition.

Environmental and Related Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, a current or
previous owner or operator of real estate may be required, regardless of knowledge or
responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or
petroleum product releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by these
parties as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial. The
presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate the contamination, may adversely
affect the owner’s ability to borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. In addition,
some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for
damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.

Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the removal, encapsulation
or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (“ACMs”) when such materials are in poor condition
or in the event of reconstruction, remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. These laws
may impose liability for release of ACMs and may provide for third parties to seek recovery from
owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. We
are not aware that any ACMs were used in the construction of the communities we developed. ACMs
were, however, used in the construction of several of the communities that we acquired. We have
implemented an operations and maintenance program for each of the communities at which ACMs have
been detected. We do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the
presence of ACMs at our communities.

We are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and
maintenance program at each of those communities. We do not anticipate that we will incur any
material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities.

All of our stabilized operating communities, and all of the communities that we are currently
developing or redeveloping, have been subjected to at least a Phase I or similar environmental
assessment, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water
sampling. These assessments, together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties,
have not revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that we believe
would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition or results of
operations. In connection with our ownership, operation and development of communities, from time
to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other
contaminants. In some cases, an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if
environmental liability arises from the contamination. There can be no assurance, however, that
all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will
be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that environmental liability arises.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials,
particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of
time. Although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to
remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years
that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or
other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the importance of adequate
ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture.
We have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture
from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident
believe a health risk is present. However, we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will
be detected and remediated in a timely manner. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our
communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove
the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities.


Additionally, we have occasionally been involved in developing, managing, leasing and operating
various properties for third parties and have sold communities that we owned and operated to third
parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and,
therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which could
relate to hazardous or toxic substances. We are not aware of any material environmental
liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such
third parties.

We cannot assure you that:

•

the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential
environmental liabilities;

•

no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the
consultants who prepared the assessments;

•

no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were
prepared;

•

the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities, such as the
presence of underground storage tanks, will not affect the environmental condition of
our communities;

•

future uses or conditions, including, without limitation, changes in applicable
environmental laws and regulations, will not result in the imposition of environmental
liability; and

•

no environmental liabilities will develop at communities that we have sold for which
we may have liability.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1978. In 1995, we reincorporated
in the State of Maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment
communities since that time. As of December 31, 2004, we had 1,702 employees.

ITEM 2.

COMMUNITIES

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities,
communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”) and Development Rights as
defined below. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established
Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. The
following is a description of each category:

Current Communities

are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized,
Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:

•

Established Communities

(also known as Same Store Communities) are
communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year
to the current year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and
had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of
the prior year. We determine which of our communities fall into the
Established Communities category as of January 1

st

of each
year and maintain that classification throughout the year, unless
disposition plans regarding a community change. For the year 2004, the
Established Communities were communities that had stabilized occupancy
and operating expenses as of January 1, 2003 and were not conducting or
planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, as described
below, and were not held for sale or planned for disposition in 2004.
We consider a community to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of
(i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year
anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.


•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all other completed
communities that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other
Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting
or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the
current year.

•

Lease-Up Communities

are communities where construction has been
complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not
reached 95%.

•

Redevelopment Communities

are communities where substantial
redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current
year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested
during the reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of $5,000,000 or
10% of the community’s acquisition cost.

Development Communities

are communities that are under construction and for
which a final certificate of occupancy has not been received. These communities may
be partially complete and operating.

Development Rights

are development opportunities in the early phase of the
development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into
a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional
contract to purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We
capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for
which we currently believe future development is probable.

In addition, we own an aggregate of approximately 77,000 square feet of office space in
Alexandria, Virginia and New Canaan, Connecticut, for our corporate office and a regional
office, with all other regional and administrative offices leased under operating leases.

Current Communities

Our Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities consisting of two and
three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The Current Communities, as of February 28, 2005,
include 105 garden-style (of which 12 are mixed communities and include townhomes), 19 high-rise
and 14 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive amenities
including some or all of the following:

•

vaulted ceilings;

•

lofts;

•

fireplaces;

•

patios/decks; and

•

modern appliances.

Other features at various communities may include:

•

swimming pools;

•

fitness centers;

•

tennis courts; and

•

business centers.


We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all communities and apartment
homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and, where vacant, available for immediate
occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented
property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to
discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher rental rates and
occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.

Our Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:

We manage and operate all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we
completed construction of 2,135 apartment homes in seven communities, acquired 1,165 apartment
homes in five communities and sold 1,360 apartment homes in five communities. In addition, we
received payment in full for our interest in a senior participating mortgage loan secured by a 302
apartment home community. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis
according to number of apartment homes, is 8.5 years.

Of the Current Communities, as of February 28, 2005, we own:

•

a fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 116 operating communities,
four of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in January 2062,
April 2095, May 2099 and March 2142;

•

a general partnership interest in three partnerships that each own a fee
simple interest in an operating community;

•

a general partnership interest in five partnerships structured as
“DownREITs,” as described more fully below, that own an aggregate of 15
communities; and

•

a membership interest in four limited liability companies that each hold a
fee simple interest in an operating community, two of which are on land subject
to land leases with one lease expiring in July 2029 and one lease expiring in
November 2089.


We also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the Development Communities, two of which
will be subject to joint venture ownership structures upon construction completion, in addition to
a membership interest in a limited liability company that owns one Development Community subject to
a land lease which expires in December 2026.

In each of our five partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or one of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose
interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each
DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any
distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the
DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of
limited partnership interests have approximated our current common stock dividend amount. Each
DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be
entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the applicable
partnership agreement. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to
present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable
partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash
redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one
share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of February 28, 2005, there were 494,071
DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial
reporting purposes.

Development Communities

As of December 31, 2004, we had ten Development Communities under construction. We expect these
Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 2,668 apartment homes to our portfolio
for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $546,700,000.
Statements regarding the future development or performance of the Development Communities are
forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will complete the Development Communities;

•

our budgeted costs or estimates of occupancy rates will be realized;

•

our schedule of leasing start dates, construction completion dates or stabilization
dates will be achieved; or

•

future developments will realize returns comparable to our past developments.

You should carefully review the discussion under “Risks of Development and Redevelopment” included
elsewhere in this Item 2.


The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or
indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except where noted.

Redevelopment Communities

As of December 31, 2004, we had four communities under redevelopment. We expect the total
capitalized cost to complete these communities, including the cost of acquisition, capital
expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment, to be approximately $229,300,000, of
which approximately $40,300,000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be invested
during redevelopment and $189,000,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment. Statements regarding
the future redevelopment or performance of the Redevelopment Communities are forward-looking
statements. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more
difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect
that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community.
We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or restabilized
operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. See
the discussion under “Risks of Development and Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this report.

reconstruction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits,
professional fees, allocated redevelopment overhead and other regulatory fees determined in
accordance with GAAP.

This community was acquired in 2004 and is currently owned by one of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries. However, we expect to reduce our ownership in this community upon closing of
the discretionary investment fund.

Development Rights

As of December 31, 2004, we are evaluating the future development of 49 new apartment communities
on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a leasehold interest or for which we
hold a purchase option. We generally hold Development Rights through options to acquire land,
although for fifteen of the Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would
be built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from those beginning
design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can
begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these
communities would ultimately add 13,491 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of
these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.
At December 31, 2004, there were cumulative capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees
and related overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $37,007,000 relating to Development Rights
that we consider probable for future development. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit
of Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $166,751,000
are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of
December 31, 2004.


The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and
regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if
any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business
judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event
that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs
incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with
the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the
pursuit of Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are
expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future
development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge
to expense.

Although the development of any particular Development Right cannot be assured, we believe that the
Development Rights, in the aggregate, present attractive potential opportunities for future
development and growth of long-term stockholder value.

Statements regarding the future development of the Development Rights are forward-looking
statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary governmental approvals or
the financing required to develop these communities, or that we will decide to develop
any particular community; or

•

if we undertake construction of any particular community, that we will complete
construction at the total capitalized cost assumed in the financial projections in the
following table.

The table on the following page presents a summary of the 49 Development Rights we are currently
pursuing.

In December 2004, we entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for
the development of Avalon at Mission Bay North II. We hold a 25% equity interest in this
joint venture and we anticipate that approximately 80% of the total capitalized cost will be
financed through a construction loan. This community, if developed, will be located on land
subject to a ground lease which expires in December 2103.


Risks of Development and Redevelopment

We intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment home communities.
Our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed to the following:

•

we may abandon opportunities we have already begun to explore based on further
review of, or changes in, financial, demographic, environmental or other factors;

•

we may encounter liquidity constraints, including the unavailability of financing on
favorable terms for the development or redevelopment of a community;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, all necessary
zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other required governmental permits and
authorizations;

•

we may incur construction or reconstruction costs for a community that exceed our
original estimates due to increased materials, labor or other expenses, which could
make completion of development or redevelopment of the community uneconomical;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed development or redevelopment
community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including competition and
market and general economic conditions, and may not be sufficient to make the community
profitable; and

•

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up on schedule, resulting in
increased debt service expense and construction costs.

The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect results of operations
and our payment of distributions to our stockholders.

Construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in the community’s
market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes to those market conditions that we
anticipated at that time. Although we attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions, we
cannot predict those changes with certainty. Construction costs have been increasing, particularly
for materials such as steel, concrete and lumber, and, for some of our Development Communities and
Development Rights, the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget. We do not
expect that these price increases will materially affect our current Development Communities.
However, these increases may materially affect Development Rights where construction has not yet
begun. Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop
the respective Development or Redevelopment Community, determined in accordance with GAAP,
including:

•

land and/or property acquisition costs;

•

construction or reconstruction costs;

•

real estate taxes;

•

capitalized interest;

•

loan fees;

•

permits;

•

professional fees;

•

allocated development or redevelopment overhead; and

•

other regulatory fees.

Costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded our original
estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. We cannot assure you
that market rents in effect at the time new development communities or redevelopment communities
complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or
reconstruction costs.


Recent Developments

Sales of Existing Communities.

We seek to increase our geographical concentration in selected high
barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we can:

•

apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;

•

reduce operating expenses; and

•

leverage management talent.

To achieve this increased concentration, we (i) sell assets that do not meet our long-term
investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the
value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to
develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the
proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate
unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of
communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable, like-kind exchange transaction.
We sold five communities, containing a total of 1,360 apartment homes, during the period from
January 1, 2004 through February 28, 2005. Net proceeds from the sale of these assets were
$210,001,000.

Land Acquisitions

. We carefully select land for development and follow established procedures that
we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2004, we acquired ten land
parcels for an aggregate purchase price of $122,775,000. The land parcels purchased, which are
currently held for future development, are as follows:

Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses

We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our
communities. These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications,
insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however,
certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or
in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s
view, economically impractical. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of
insured limits were to occur, we could lose our capital invested in a community, as well as the
anticipated future revenues from such community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay
any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. If an uninsured liability
to a third-party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with, or court
ordered damages to, that third-party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could
materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults.
A large concentration of our communities lie near, and thus are susceptible to, the major fault
lines in California, including the San Andreas fault and the Hayward fault. We cannot assure you
that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In June 2004, we
renewed our earthquake insurance. We have in place with respect to communities located in
California, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a
deductible per building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five
percent deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence. Earthquake coverage outside
of California is subject to a $200,000,000 limit, except with respect to the state of Washington,
for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a
$100,000 deductible per occurrence. In addition, up to a policy aggregate of $3,000,000, the next
$400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional deductible.

Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was renewed on August 1,
2004 and the insurance coverage provided for in these renewal policies did not materially change
from the preceding year. Including the costs we estimate that we may incur as a result of
deductibles, we expect the cost related to these insurance categories for the policy period from
August 1, 2004 to July 31, 2005 to remain flat as compared to the prior period.

Our property insurance policy was scheduled to renew on December 1, 2005; however, in an effort to
capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to extend the first $15,000,000 layer of the
policy by five months, thereby changing the renewal date for this layer to May 1, 2006. The
remaining layers are currently scheduled to renew on December 1, 2005. We are currently in
negotiations with all carriers to align the renewal dates. Based on this policy extension, we have
seen a decline in insurance premiums for property coverage, which combined with the cost we may
incur as a result of deductibles, we expect will result in declining overall insurance costs as
compared to prior periods.

Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been
reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. In November 2002, Congress
passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance
available. In connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property damage
due to terrorism up to $200,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased insurance for certain
terrorist acts, not covered under TRIA, such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often
referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and
exclusions. Our general liability policy provides TRIA coverage (subject to deductibles and
insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials,
particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of
time. Although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to
remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years
that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or
other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the importance of adequate
ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture.
We have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture
from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident
believe a health risk is present. However, we cannot assure that mold or excessive moisture will
be detected and remediated in a timely manner. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our
communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation


program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other
liabilities. We cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property
damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure
to mold at one of our communities.

We may elect to purchase insurance separate from our corporate or portfolio insurance policies for
certain communities. Common insurance policies purchased are builder’s risk policies and owner
controlled insurance policies (“OCIP”) that cover workers compensation and general liability risks
for us and our enrolled contractors.

In March 2005, we will
renew our directors and officers (“D&O”) insurance. We have met with several carriers in anticipation
of this renewal. New carriers have entered the insurance market, increasing competition, and the
capital capacity of existing carriers has expanded, resulting in a partial reversal of the
significant premium increases experienced in recent years. However, the number and severity of
recent and pending D&O claims may result in premium increases for this renewal.

Americans with Disabilities Act

The apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire must comply with
Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the extent that such properties are “public
accommodations” and/or “commercial facilities” as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements could require removal of
structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our properties where such
removal is readily achievable. The Americans with Disabilities Act does not, however, consider
residential properties, such as apartment communities, to be public accommodations or commercial
facilities, except to the extent portions of such facilities, such as leasing offices, are open to
the public. We believe our properties comply in all material respects with all present
requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable state laws. Noncompliance
could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.

ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As reported most recently in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, we are
currently involved in litigation with York Hunter Construction, Inc. and National Fire Insurance
Company. A non-jury trial ended in April 2004 and on May 20, 2004, the court issued a ruling,
finding that (i) York Hunter breached the Construction Management Agreement between it and the
Company in failing to complete the project and abandoning the construction site and is therefore
liable to the Company for consequential damages, and (ii) National Union, having failed to exercise
its various rights to perform and complete, is liable to the Company for consequential damages.
The Court issued a ruling dated October 6, 2004, awarding the
Company approximately $1,250,000 plus interest. The Company has determined that it will file an appeal to seek an increase in the
damage award.

Also as reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, on June 6, 2003, a
purported California class action lawsuit,

Julie E. Ko v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. and Does 1
through 100

, was filed against the Company in California’s Los Angeles County Superior Court. The
suit purports to be brought on behalf of all of the Company’s former California residents who,
during the four-year period prior to the filing of the suit, paid a security deposit to the Company
for the rental of residential property in California and had a portion of the deposit withheld by
the Company, allegedly in excess of the damages actually sustained by the Company. The plaintiff
seeks compensatory and statutory damages in unspecified amounts as well as injunctive relief,
restitution, and an award of attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs of suit. The complaint seeking
class certification was amended in March 2004 and the Company responded to the amended complaint on
May 3, 2004. Due to the uncertainty of many critical factual and legal issues, including the
viability of the case as a class action, it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome.

We are involved in various other claims and/or administrative proceedings that arise in the
ordinary course of our business. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe
that any of these outstanding litigation matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

We expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends. However, dividend
distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors as the Board
of Directors may consider relevant. The Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from
time to time. In February 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend on
our common stock for the first quarter of 2005 of $0.71 per share, a 1.4% increase over the
previous quarterly dividend of $0.70 per share. The increased dividend is payable on April 15,
2005 to all common stockholders of record as of April 1, 2005.

During the three months ended December 31, 2004, we issued 35,500 shares of common stock in
exchange for 35,500 units of limited partnership held by certain limited partners of Avalon
DownREIT V, L.P. and Bay Pacific Northwest, L.P. These shares were issued in reliance on an
exemption from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. We are relying on
the exemption based on factual representations received from the limited partners who received
these shares.

Information regarding
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is
included in the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Managers and Related Stockholder Matters” on
page 58 of this Form 10-K.


ITEM 6.     SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table provides historical consolidated financial, operating and other data for
AvalonBay Communities, Inc. You should read the table with our Consolidated Financial Statements
and the Notes included in this report. Dollars in thousands, except per share information.


Notes to Selected Financial Data

(1)

EBITDA is defined by us as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization from both continuing and discontinued operations. Under this
definition, which complies with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, EBITDA includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests.
Management generally considers EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income
of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our ability to incur and
service debt and to make capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered as an
alternative to net income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, or “GAAP”), as an indicator of our operating performance, or to cash flows from
operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Our
calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA as calculated by other companies.

(2)

We generally consider Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” to be an appropriate supplemental
measure of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses
related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary
among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and
useful life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real
estate between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to
understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in
this report. Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts

â

, (“NAREIT”), we calculate FFO
as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for:

•

gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities;

•

extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP);

•

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle;

•

depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.


In 2004, we
changed our methodology for the calculation of FFO to include gains
or losses on undepreciated property (i.e., land). FFO includes gains
on land sales of $1,138 and $1,234 in 2004 and 2003, respectively,
and, as a result, FFO for 2003 has been increased from amounts
previously reported.
The inclusion of these gains or losses is acceptable, but not required, under the definition of FFO adopted by NAREIT. The
treatment of these gains and losses varies within the REIT industry; however, we believe that inclusion of these gains and losses
allows for a better comparison of our reported FFO to FFO as reported by our peers in the apartment REIT industry. FFO does not
represent net income in accordance with GAAP, and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income, which remains
the primary measure, as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to
our calculation of FFO. The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO:

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP,
and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating
activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A presentation of GAAP based cash
flow metrics is provided in “Cash Flow Information” in the table on the previous page.

Current Communities consist of all communities other than those which are still under
construction and have not received a certificate of occupancy.


ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We focus on the investment in
and ownership and operation of apartment communities in high
barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. As of
February 28, 2005, we had 138 current
operating communities, which are the primary contributors to our overall operating performance.
The net operating income of these communities, which is one of the financial measures that we use
to evaluate community performance, is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our
markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels, and our ability to control operating costs. Our
overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and
the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities. We seek to create
long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to
develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets; operating
apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and
when pricing is attractive.

This report, including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations, contains forward-looking statements that predict or indicate future events or trends
and that do not report historical matters. Actual results or developments could differ materially
from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page 54 of
this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes
included elsewhere in this report.

Business Description and Community Information Overview

We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long-term investment opportunity
compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help
reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate
investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new rental household
formations are expected to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate
cycle. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement
process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is
in limited supply.

We regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by
product type within our individual markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic,
Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States. Our
strategy is to deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an
intense focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our communities are upscale, which
generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership
and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points,
consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services.

We believe that, over an entire business cycle, lower housing affordability and the limited new
supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger
increases in cash flow relative to other markets. However, throughout the business cycle,
apartment market fundamentals, and therefore operating cash flows, are affected by overall economic
conditions. A number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and
2003, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial services sectors. This resulted in a
prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and
demand. However, 2004 was a year of transition, where the economy showed signs of an early
phase recovery, as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims. The
improvement in the economic environment has resulted in more stabilized apartment market
fundamentals, as reflected in the following operating results achieved within our Established
Community portfolio specifically during the last three months of 2004:

•

we achieved both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth, our second
year-over-year increase since 2001;


•

economic occupancy stabilized and remained at approximately 95% in each of our markets,
despite a seasonal decline in leasing;

•

concessions per move-in declined both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis; and

•

we achieved the first sequential increase in average rental rates since 2001.

Based on these results we believe that 2005 will be a year of continued growth. We expect that
with continued job growth in our markets, apartment market fundamentals (the demand/supply balance)
will continue to improve such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply by a ratio of
almost two to one. The improvement may not be experienced evenly throughout our markets, but is
nevertheless expected to result in overall revenue growth for our Established Community portfolio
in 2005.

In anticipation of continued improvement in apartment fundamentals and stronger apartment demand,
we have increased our development and acquisition volume. During 2004, we increased our level of
acquisition activity in preparation of the closing of a discretionary investment fund. In
addition, we continued to secure new Development Rights, as discussed below, bringing our pipeline
for potential development opportunities to a new high. However, we continued to dispose of
communities in 2004 in response to opportunities to realize value. In 2005, we expect to continue
acquisitions for the discretionary investment fund, particularly potential redevelopment
opportunities, and to continue to be an opportunistic seller, while increasing our development
activity over 2004 levels.

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities,
communities in various stages of development (“Development Communities”), and Development Rights
(i.e., land or land options held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this report.
Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other
Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established
Communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these
communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years.
Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized
occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year, but had not achieved
stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities
where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities
consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during
the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related
operating information can be found in Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of our Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall
operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities,
for which a detailed discussion can be found in “Results of Operations” as part of our discussion
of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating
potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities
within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities, for which detailed discussions
can be found in “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

As of December 31, 2004, we owned or held an ownership interest in 148 apartment communities
containing 42,810 apartment homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which ten
communities were under construction and four communities were under reconstruction. In addition,
we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 49
communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 13,491 apartment
homes.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including
making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances
relating to various transactions had been different, or different estimates or assumptions had been
made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in
different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a
discussion of accounting policies that we


consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may
require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are
inherently uncertain. As a REIT that owns, operates and develops apartment communities, our
critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, cost capitalization, asset impairment
evaluation and REIT status. A discussion of all of our accounting policies, including further
discussion of the critical accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1,
“Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” In accordance with our standard
lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at
the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease, which is generally
one year. A discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for Established
Communities can be found in “Results of Operations.”

Cost Capitalization

We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan fees,
property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when active development commences
until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which
is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs during
redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and
other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for
redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is
available for a new resident. Rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial
lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue.

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights for which we
currently believe future development is probable. These costs include legal fees, design fees and
related overhead costs. Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various
factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and
availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for
which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if
the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any
capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense.

We generally capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades
only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not
related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, virtually all
capitalized costs are non-recurring, as recurring make-ready costs are expensed as incurred.
Recurring make-ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance replacements; (ii) floor coverings;
(iii) interior painting; and (iv) other redecorating costs. Because we expense recurring
make-ready costs such as carpet replacements, our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the
third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover. We
capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, only if the item is a
new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related to acquisitions,
development and redevelopment were $347,091,000, $296,764,000 and $457,851,000, respectively. For
Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non-revenue generating capital
expenditures of $12,347,000 or $354 per apartment home in 2004, $11,064,000 or $333 per apartment
home in 2003 and $10,214,000 or $302 per apartment home in 2002. In addition, revenue generating
capital expenditures, such as water submetering equipment and cable installations, were $637,000,
$529,000 and $697,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged
to expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to these
communities was $1,348 in 2004, $1,262 in 2003 and $1,224 in 2002. Historically, we have
experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed


maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased, and
expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover. We expect these trends to continue, with
capitalized costs increasing in 2005 over prior year levels as we embark on a number of community
upgrades and improvements.

Asset Impairment Evaluation

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a
community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and
projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted
basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the
estimated projected operating cash flow of the community, we would recognize an impairment loss
equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value.
Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value
less the cost to sell.

We account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that are not variable interest entities
in accordance with Statement of Position 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures”
and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock.” If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value
of an investment, we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A
loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if
the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the
investment.

REIT Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a
real estate investment trust, or REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election.
A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of
organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute
at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be
subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our
stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal
income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may
not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.


Results of Operations

Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income
of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions, net operating income
derived from acquisitions and development completions, the loss of net operating income related to
disposed communities and capital market, disposition and financing activity. A comparison of our
operating results for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 follows (dollars in thousands):

Net income available to common stockholders

decreased $49,736,000, or 19.1%, to $211,045,000 in
2004. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales as a result of reduced
disposition activity from the historically high levels experienced in 2003, partially offset by
increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities. Net income available
to common stockholders increased $105,059,000 or 67.5% to $260,781,000 in 2003. This increase is
primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities due to increased disposition activity,
including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities, and the absence of
impairment losses in 2003, partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expense.

Net operating income (“NOI”)

is considered by management to be an important and appropriate
supplemental measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because it helps
both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior
to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating
performance of a community, and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of
individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have
different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring
real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for
determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets.


NOI is defined by us as total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property
taxes, and excludes:

•

corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses;

•

investments and investment management;

•

interest income and expense;

•

general and administrative expense;

•

impairment losses;

•

equity in income of unconsolidated entities;

•

minority interest in consolidated partnerships;

•

venture partner interest in profit-sharing;

•

depreciation expense;

•

gain on sale of real estate assets;

•

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle; and

•

income from discontinued operations.

NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP.
Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our
performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating
activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI necessarily indicative of
cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of NOI for 2004, 2003 and 2002, along with a
reconciliation to net income for each year, is provided in the preceding table.

The NOI increase of $35,313,000 in 2004 and decrease of $583,000 in 2003, as compared to the prior
years, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in
thousands):

(1)

For purposes of this table, amounts have
been restated from amounts previously reported for changes in
discountinued operations as described in Note 7, “ Discountinued
Operations - Real Estate Assets Sold or Held for Sale, ” of our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The NOI decreases in Established Communities were largely due to the effects of the weakened
economy in our markets during 2003 and the first half of 2004. The impact of historical job losses
in many of our markets, in addition to strong single-family home sales, aggravated a weak demand
environment, which caused market rental rates to decline. However, 2004 was a year of transition,
where modest job growth and declining unemployment claims reflected the early stages of an economic
recovery. Strengthening apartment fundamentals, along with strong on-site execution, resulted in
year-over-year increases in NOI during the latter half of 2004, as evidenced in the diminishing
decline in NOI in 2004 as compared to 2003. Based on economic forecasts that project an
acceleration in job growth in our markets in 2005 as compared to the modest job growth experienced
in 2004, we expect an improved demand/supply ratio in 2005. Our occupancy has reached stabilized
levels, and we began to increase rental rates and reduce concessions in the latter half of 2004.
In 2005, we expect the positive momentum from 2004 to continue, resulting in growth in revenue from
our Established Communities of 2.0% to 4.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004. We aggressively manage
operating expenses, which we expect to increase by 1.5% to 3.5% in 2005, resulting in NOI growth
for our Established Community portfolio of 2.5% to 4.5% in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Rental and other income

increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to rental income generated from newly
developed and acquired communities, as well as increased occupancy for our Established Communities,
partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our Established Communities. We expect
continued improvement in apartment fundamentals due largely to the job growth projected for 2005.


Overall Portfolio — The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to
36,431 apartment homes for 2004 as compared to 32,629 apartment homes for 2003 and 30,437
in 2002. This change is primarily the result of increased homes available from newly
developed and acquired communities and an increase in the overall occupancy rate,
partially offset by communities sold in 2003 and 2004. The weighted average monthly
revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,479 in 2004 as compared to $1,508 in
2003 and $1,539 in 2002, primarily due to the poor demand/supply fundamentals in our
markets that resulted in a high concessionary environment in certain of our markets.

Established Communities — Rental revenue decreased $1,496,000, or 0.3%, in 2004 and
$20,424,000, or 4.3%, in 2003. These decreases are due to declining rental rates,
partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to the prior years. For
2004, the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased 1.8% to
$1,418 compared to $1,444 in 2003, partially due to the impact of increased concessions
granted throughout 2003 and into 2004. The average economic occupancy increased from
93.8% in 2003 to 95.3% in 2004. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that
apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different
economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross
potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross
potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes
at market rents. We expect rental revenue from Established Communities to increase 2.0%
to 4.0% in 2005 as compared to 2004.

Although rental revenue from the Established Community portfolio as a whole was relatively flat in
2004 as compared to 2003, we had increases in Established Communities’ rental revenue in four of
our six regions. The largest increase was in the Mid-Atlantic with an increase in rental revenue
of 2.4% between years, reflecting an increase in both economic occupancy and average rental rates.
In addition, in Southern California, we were able to increase average rental rates by 1.5%, while
also increasing economic occupancy by 0.4%, resulting in an increase in rental revenue of 1.9%
between years. The Midwest and Pacific Northwest experienced increases in rental revenue of 2.2%
and 1.4%, respectively, during 2004 as compared to 2003, reflecting increased economic occupancy
partially offset by declining average rental rates.

However, our total rental revenue from Established Communities was impacted by the continued
declines in average rental rates in certain Northern California and Northeast markets. Northern
California, which accounted for approximately 31.1% of Established Community rental revenue during
2004, experienced a decline in rental revenue of 3.1% in 2004 as compared to 2003, partially
related to the continued impact of job losses experienced in the technology sector in prior years.
Although economic occupancy in Northern California increased to an average of 95.6% in 2004,
average rental rates dropped 3.4% to $1,365 from $1,413 during 2003. However, we began to see
signs of improvement in Northern California during the last three months of 2004, as average rental
rates and economic occupancy both increased sequentially. Therefore, we expect year-over-year
revenue growth in Northern California in 2005.

The Northeast region accounted for approximately 34.2% of Established Community rental revenue
during 2004. Rental revenue remained relatively flat as compared to 2003, as the region entered
the early stages of economic recovery from the job losses experienced in the financial services
sector in prior years. Economic occupancy increased by 2.5% during 2004, while average rental
rates dropped 2.5% to $1,800 from $1,847 in 2003. The Northeast region appears to be stabilizing,
as reflected in year-over-year rental revenue growth during the latter half of 2004. Although we
expect pressure on rental rates to continue in the Northeast region, we expect year-over-year
revenue growth in the Northeast in 2005, but at a lesser pace than other regions.

In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the
approximate lease term, which is generally one year. As a supplemental measure, we also present
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of
both current and historical concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable
comparisons to revenue as


reported by other companies. Rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also
allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions, as well as current rental
market conditions.

The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP to total rental revenue
adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our Established Communities for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31,
2002 is not presented, as Established Community classification is not applicable prior to January
1, 2003. See Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Concessions granted per move-in for Established Communities averaged $974 during 2004, an increase
of 15.5% from $843 in 2003. Concessions granted per move-in peaked at $1,109 during the three
months ended June 30, 2004, before subsiding to $861 during the three months ended December 31,
2004. The decrease in recent months is expected to continue into 2005 as demand/supply
fundamentals improve with job growth and we regain pricing power. However, because we amortize
concessions over the lease term, the historically high concessions from 2004 will continue to lower
reported operating results in 2005.

Management, development and other fees

decreased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years
due to a decrease in the number of communities that we manage. In addition, in 2002 we recognized
$711,000 in construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a community owned
by a limited liability company in which we have a membership interest. In 2005, we expect
management, development and other fees to increase as we begin to earn asset and property
management fees from the discretionary investment fund discussed elsewhere in this report.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes

increased in both 2004 and 2003 due to
the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes, coupled with increased expenses
due to salary increases and leasing bonuses, as well as increased make-ready costs associated with
increasing occupancy.

For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes,
increased $2,131,000, or 2.2%, to
$141,823,000 in 2004 due primarily to increased salaries
and leasing bonuses, as well as increased make-ready costs associated with increasing
occupancy as discussed above. During 2003, operating expenses increased $5,724,000, or
6.1%, due primarily to inclement weather, increased insurance costs and bad debt expenses.
We expect expense growth in 2005 to be consistent with growth levels in 2004 with
pressure on salaries and utilities, partially offset by moderation in bad debt expenses,
marketing costs and insurance.

Property taxes

increased in both 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to overall
higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes,
partially offset by property tax refunds.

For Established Communities, property taxes increased in 2004 and 2003 by $333,000 and
$1,470,000, respectively, as compared to the prior year, due to overall higher assessments
throughout all regions, partially offset by successful tax appeals. We expect property
taxes to


increase in
2005 as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to
offset budget deficits. We manage property tax increases internally, as well as engage
third-party consultants, and appeal increases when appropriate.

Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses

increased in 2004 due to
increased compensation costs. During 2003, corporate-level property management and other indirect
operating expenses increased due to associate separation costs, as well as increased
corporate-level marketing and customer service costs to respond to pressure on economic occupancy.

Investments and investment management

reflects the costs incurred related to investment
acquisitions, investment management and abandoned pursuit costs, which include the abandonment or
impairment of development pursuits, acquisition pursuits and technology investments. Investments
and investment management increased in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to costs incurred in forming a
potential discretionary investment fund, increased compensation costs and increased abandoned
pursuit costs. Investments and investment management decreased in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to
decreases in abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs were $1,726,000, $1,180,000 and
$2,800,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile, and the
activity experienced in any given year may not be experienced in future years. We expect
investments and investment management costs to continue to increase in 2005 due to the costs
associated with operating and managing the investment fund.

Interest expense

decreased in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the repayment of unsecured
debt and reissuance at lower interest rates, overall lower interest rates and lower average
outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility. Interest expense increased in 2003 as
compared to 2002, primarily due to the issuance in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average
outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of certain
unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short-term and long-term borrowings. We
expect interest expense to increase in 2005 as interest rates rise and we increase our leverage
from current levels.

Depreciation expens

e increased in both 2004 and 2003 primarily due to the completion of development
and redevelopment activities, as well as the acquisition of new communities in 2002 and 2004.

General and administrative expense

(“G&A”) increased in 2004 as a result of higher compensation
expense, increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate
matters and additional corporate governance costs, including costs relating to compliance with
Sarbanes-Oxley. G&A increased in 2003 as a result of construction litigation relating to a
community that has completed development and increased directors and officers (“D&O”) insurance,
which was renewed in March 2003. We expect G&A to continue to increase in 2005 due to increased
corporate governance (primarily Sarbanes-Oxley compliance) and compensation costs, but at a reduced
pace as compared to 2004.

Impairment loss

of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land parcels that were
determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore were planned for disposition. No
impairment losses were recorded in either 2004 or 2003.

Equity in income of unconsolidated entities

decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 primarily due
to our share of the gain received on a community sold in 2003 which was accounted for under the
equity method in which we held a 50% interest.

Interest income

decreased in 2004 and 2003 as compared to prior years due to lower average cash
balances invested and lower interest rates. In addition, effective January 1, 2004, we
consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation
of FASB Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, and
Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” as revised in December 2003. Therefore, interest income that we
recognized in 2003 and 2002 is not reflected in 2004 as such amounts were eliminated in
consolidation. (See Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the
Consolidated Financial Statements). On October 15, 2004, we received payment in full of the
outstanding mortgage note due from this entity. The mortgage note was repaid prior to its
scheduled


maturity, and therefore the total proceeds of $33,994,000 included an early prepayment premium of
approximately $1,240,000 (net of related legal costs) along with the unpaid principal balance and
accrued interest. Upon repayment of the mortgage note, our economic interest in this entity ended,
and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under FIN 46 and we
discontinued consolidation.

Venture partner interest in profit-sharing

represents the income allocated to our venture partner
in a profit-sharing arrangement as discussed in Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,”
of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Fluctuations as compared to prior years are due to
changes in the net income of the underlying real estate. Effective December 31, 2004, we no longer
account for our interest in this venture as a profit-sharing arrangement.

Minority interest in
consolidated partnerships

decreased in 2004 due to the consolidation of an
entity under FIN 46, as discussed above. We do not hold an equity interest in this entity, and
therefore 100% of the entity’s net income or loss is recognized as minority interest in
consolidated partnerships.

Income from discontinued operations

represents the net income generated by communities sold during
the period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004. The decreases in 2004 and 2003 are due
to the timing of the sale of five communities in 2004 and eleven communities in 2003.

Gain on sale of communities

decreased in 2004 and increased in 2003 due to the volume of
disposition activity in each year. The amount of gains realized depends on many factors, including
the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market
conditions in the local area. We expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio
allocation needs as well as to respond to opportunities in the market to maximize risk adjusted
returns.

Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle

in 2004 is a result of the implementation of
FIN 46, discussed above, and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under
FIN 46 and the previously recorded net assets.

Dividends attributable to preferred stock

decreased during 2004 and 2003 primarily as a result of
several preferred stock redemptions during 2003 and 2002.

Funds from Operations

(“FFO”) is considered an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating
and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of
previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners
of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life
estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate between
periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our
operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in our Consolidated
Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion and presentation of FFO, see “Selected
Financial Data,” included in Item 6 of this report.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing
activities and investing activities. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i)
the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv)
operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and amount of cash flow
provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital
markets environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. The timing and type of capital
markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment,
acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment,
such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital.


We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from operations, and other
expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity
needs are to fund:

•

normal recurring operating expenses;

•

debt service and maturity payments;

•

preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit
distributions;

•

the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our REIT
qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

•

development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently
engaged; and

•

opportunities for the acquisition of improved property.

We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by
operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable
rate unsecured credit facility.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $1,582,000 at December 31, 2004, a decrease of $5,476,000 from
$7,058,000 on December 31, 2003. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to
operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities — Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $275,678,000 in 2004
from $239,677,000 in 2003, primarily due to additional NOI from recently acquired and developed
communities, partially offset by the loss of NOI from the 16 communities sold in 2004 and 2003, as
discussed earlier in this report.

Investing Activities — Net cash used in investing activities of $251,683,000 in 2004 related to
investments in assets through development, redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities,
partially offset by proceeds from asset dispositions and the receipt of payment on a participating
mortgage note. During 2004, we invested $498,020,000 in the purchase and development of real
estate and capital expenditures:

•

We began the development of six new communities. These communities, if developed as
expected, will contain a total of 1,310 apartment homes, and the total capitalized cost,
including land acquisition costs, is projected to be approximately $241,100,000. We
completed the development of seven communities containing a total of 2,135 apartment homes
for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition cost, of $363,700,000.

•

We began the redevelopment of three communities, two of which were acquired prior to
1999, and one of which was acquired in 2004 (as discussed below) with
the intent of being owned by a discretionary investment fund. These communities contain 649 apartment
homes and, if redeveloped as expected, will be completed for a total capitalized cost of
$69,300,000, of which $55,100,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment. We completed the
redevelopment of one community containing 308 apartment homes for a total capitalized cost
of $44,000,000, of which $35,700,000 was incurred prior to redevelopment.

•

We acquired five communities containing a total of 1,165 apartment homes for an
aggregate purchase price of $134,216,000, which included the assumption of $8,155,000 of
fixed rate mortgage debt. Four of these communities were acquired with the intent of
being owned by a discretionary investment fund.

•

We acquired ten parcels of land, including three parcels of improved land, in
connection with Development Rights, for an aggregate purchase price of $122,775,000.

•

We had capital expenditures relating to current communities’ real estate assets of
$12,984,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures of $860,000.

Financing Activities — Net cash used in financing activities totaled $29,471,000 in 2004,
consisting primarily of dividends paid and certain debt repayments, partially offset by a decrease
in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, issuance of mortgage notes payable, issuance of
common stock for option


exercises and issuance of unsecured notes. See Note 3, “Notes Payable,
Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility,” and Note 4, “Stockholders’ Equity,” of our Consolidated
Financial Statements, for additional information.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

We have a $500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank
and Wachovia Bank, N.A. serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial
banks. Under the terms of the credit facility, if we elect to increase the facility by up to an
additional $150,000,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree
to provide the additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the facility up to
$650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase
in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose
to commit to lend additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual
facility fee of approximately $750,000 in quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility
bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), rating
levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current
stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum (3.02% on February 28, 2005). The spread over LIBOR
can vary from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 1.15% based upon the rating of our long-term unsecured
debt. In addition, a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to $250,000,000.
This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a
rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility. The
competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had $100,000,000
outstanding under this competitive bid option at February 28, 2005 priced at LIBOR plus 0.29%, or
2.78%. We are subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility,
including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges
coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels, and (ii) prohibitions on paying
dividends in amounts that exceed 95% of our FFO, except as may be required to maintain our REIT
status. The credit facility matures in May 2008, assuming our exercise of a one-year renewal
option. At February 28, 2005, $291,500,000 was outstanding, $27,251,000 was used to provide
letters of credit and $181,249,000 was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility.

Future Financing and Capital Needs — Debt Maturities

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and long-term debt at the
time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we anticipate that no significant portion of the
principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand
sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance
the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt
offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities
or groups of communities, draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings.
Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot
assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if
available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.

The following debt activity occurred during 2004:

•

We repaid $125,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid
interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity, and no prepayment penalties were incurred.
In addition, we issued $150,000,000 in unsecured notes under our existing shelf
registration statement at an annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest on these notes is
payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, and they mature in April 2014;

•

We repaid $24,251,000 in fixed rate mortgage debt, secured by two current communities,
repaid $10,400,000 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to the sale of a community
and transferred $28,335,000 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to the sale of two
communities to the respective purchasers;


•

We issued $82,800,000 in variable rate, conventional debt on three communities, and
purchased interest rate protection agreements that serve to effectively limit the level to
which interest rates can rise on this debt to a weighted average of 8.5%;

•

We obtained a $50,000,000 secured construction loan for the construction of a development
community that will be owned and operated in a joint venture entity upon completion.
Outstanding draws  ($6,278,000 as December 31, 2004) will bear interest at a variable rate and will come due in March 2008,
assuming the exercise of two one-year extension options;

•

We issued $16,765,000 in variable rate, conventional debt on one community;

•

We assumed $8,155,000 in fixed rate, conventional mortgage debt in conjunction with the
acquisition of a community;

•

We assumed $20,141,000 in fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition of three
parcels of improved land related to three Development Rights;

•

We replaced the credit enhancements, including interest rate swaps, on approximately
$87,000,000 of our variable rate, tax-exempt debt when such credit
enhancements expired, of which $9,580,000 was transferred upon the sale of a community to the respective purchaser.
We put in place interest rate protection agreements that serve to effectively limit the
level to which interest rates can rise on the remaining debt to a range of 6.7% to 9.0%;
and

•

We renegotiated the terms of a fixed rate, tax-exempt bond on one community in the
amount of $9,780,000 to decrease the annual interest rate from 7.0% to 4.9%.

In January 2005, we repaid $150,000,000 in previously issued unsecured notes, along
with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity. No prepayment penalty was
incurred. In addition, in March 2005, we issued $100,000,000 in
unsecured notes under our existing shelf registration statement at an
annual effective interest rate of 4.999%. Interest on these notes is payable
semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, and they mature in March 2013.

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement originally provided $750,000,000 of debt and
equity capacity, however, only $370,984,000 remains outstanding
(after consideration of the March 2005 issuance discussed above). We cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on
cost-effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all
times.

The table on the following page details debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our unsecured credit
facility, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands).



Future Financing and Capital Needs — Portfolio and Other Activity

As of December 31, 2004, we had ten new communities under construction, for which a total estimated
cost of $145,012,000 remained to be invested. In addition, we had four communities under
reconstruction, for which a total estimated cost of $15,710,000 remained to be invested.
Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under
construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to pursuing Development
Rights, will be funded from:

•

the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility;

•

the net proceeds from sales of existing communities;

•

retained operating cash;

•

the issuance of debt or equity securities; and/or

•

private equity funding.

Before planned reconstruction activity, including reconstruction activity related to a
discretionary investment fund discussed below, or the construction of a Development Right begins,
we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained,
we may have to abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that were
capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the
increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction
activity and significant losses could be incurred.

We have engaged in discussions with a limited number of institutional investors regarding the
formation of a discretionary fund that would acquire and operate apartment communities. This fund
would serve, for a period of three years from its initial closing date or until 80% of its committed
capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through which we would acquire apartment communities,
subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio
acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions that are
inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund, if any. The fund would not restrict our development
activities, and would terminate after a term of eight years, subject to two one-year extensions.
As of February 28, 2005, we have acquired four communities with
the intent of being owned by the fund,
but which are currently consolidated and included in our operating results. We are currently
targeting acquisitions for the fund where value creation opportunities are present through one or
more of the following: redevelopment activities, market cycle opportunities or improved property
operations. We expect the fund to have equity commitments of up to $330,000,000 and the ability to
employ leverage through debt financings up to 65% on a portfolio basis, which would enable the fund
to invest up to $940,000,000. We would contribute 20% of the total equity up to $50,000,000. We
expect closing on the equity funding during the first quarter of 2005. There can be no assurance
as to when or if such a fund will be formed or, if formed, what its size, terms or investment
performance will be.

We have also recently increased our use of joint ventures to hold individual real estate assets,
pursuant to which certain developments will be held upon completion through partnership vehicles.
We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and
secondarily as a source of liquidity. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and
will continue to be individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a
community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the
joint venture or partnership agreement. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to
enter into joint ventures in the future, or that, if we do, we will achieve our objectives.


The following joint venture activity occurred during 2004:

•

We entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for the
development of Avalon Chrystie Place I. We hold a 20% equity interest in this joint
venture entity (with a right to 50% of distributions after achievement of a threshold
return), with the remaining 80% equity interest held by the third-party;

•

We entered into an agreement with an unrelated third-party which provides that,
after we complete construction of Avalon Del Rey, the community will be owned and
operated by a joint venture between us and the third-party. Upon construction
completion, the third-party venture partner will invest $49,000,000 and will be
granted a 70% ownership interest in the venture, while we retain a 30% equity
interest;

•

We entered into an agreement to develop Avalon at Juanita Village through a
wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary and, upon construction completion, contribute the
community to a joint venture. Upon contribution of the community to the joint
venture, we expect to be reimbursed for all costs incurred to develop the community.
The third-party joint venture partner will receive a 100% equity interest in the joint
venture and will manage the joint venture. We will receive a residual profits
interest and will be engaged to manage the community for a property management fee;
and

•

We entered into a joint venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for the
development of Avalon at Mission Bay North II, which is expected to begin construction
in early 2005. We hold a 25% equity interest in this joint venture entity, with the
remaining 75% equity interest held by the third-party.

In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we often sell assets that do not meet
our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a
portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those
sales to develop and redevelop communities. In response to real estate and capital markets
conditions, including strong institutional demand for product in our markets, we sold five
communities in 2004, and anticipate selling additional communities when opportunities arise for
harvesting value in 2005. However, we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on
terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of
assets an appealing strategy. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be
immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a
community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses,
NOI and FFO. As of February 28, 2005, we have two communities classified as held for sale under
GAAP. We are actively pursuing the disposition of these communities and expect to close on these
dispositions in 2005. However, we cannot assure you that these communities will be sold as
planned.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in
unconsolidated real estate entities, with ownership interests up to
50%. Three
of these unconsolidated real estate entities, Avalon Terrace, LLC,
CVP I, LLC and AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC have debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Avalon Terrace, LLC has $22,500,000 of variable rate debt
which matures in November 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with
operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. CVP I, LLC has a $117,000,000 construction
loan which matures in February 2009, assuming exercise of two one-year renewal options, and is
payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity.
AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC has $36,124,000 of variable rate debt which
matures in April 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate
entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate.
 We have not guaranteed the debt on Avalon
Terrace, LLC and AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate
 entities be unable to do so. However, in connection with the general contractor services that we
provide to CVP I, LLC, the entity that owns and is developing Avalon Chrystie Place I, we have
provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard
financing requirements related to the construction financing. Our obligations under this guarantee
will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender’s standard completion
requirements have been satisfied. We currently expect this to occur in 2006.
There are no lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative
financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities. In
evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our
proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt. For more information


regarding the operations of our unconsolidated entities see Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated
Real Estate Entities,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary
environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases. Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of
inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term
and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent
environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined under the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use
of the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “assume,” “project,” “plan,”
“may,” “shall,” “will” and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate
future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include,
among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:

•

our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of
communities;

•

the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under
construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;

•

the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;

•

the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;

•

the anticipated operating performance of our communities;

•

cost, yield and earnings estimates;

•

our declaration or payment of distributions;

•

our joint venture and discretionary fund activities;

•

our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions,
dispositions, financings and other matters;

•

our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code;

•

the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in
selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest
regions of the United States and in general;


•

the availability of debt and equity financing;

•

interest rates;

•

general economic conditions; and

•

trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements;
rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the
matters discussed. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks,
uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ
materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by
these forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to
reach agreements with third parties or to obtain desired zoning and other
local approvals;

•

we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons,
including changes in local market conditions which make development less
desirable, increases in costs of development and increases in the cost of
capital, resulting in losses;

•

construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;

•

we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under
development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest
costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;

•

occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition
and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;

•

financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash
flow from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient
for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of
opportunities;

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal
and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the
terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
indebtedness;

•

we may be unsuccessful in closing, managing or investing in the
discretionary investment fund; and

•

we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition.

In addition, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of
the date of this report. We do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements, and
therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report.

ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain financial market risks, the most predominant being fluctuations in
interest rates. We monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk
management program, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce
the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. The effect of interest rate
fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results,
such as rental rates and occupancy. The specific market risks and the potential impact on our
operating results are described below.

Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our
variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates.
We had $217,174,000 and $168,505,000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher
throughout 2004 and 2003, our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately
$3,682,000 and $2,665,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years.


We currently use interest rate protection agreements (consisting of interest rate swap and cap
agreements) to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate
indebtedness. Under swap agreements:

•

we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a
fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate (generally, the interest rate on a
particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into, plus a fixed
increment), and

•

the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on
the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular
market index.

As of December 31, 2004, the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately
$69,000,000 of our variable rate, tax-exempt debt. Furthermore, a swap agreement to fix the
interest rate on approximately $22,500,000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of
December 31, 2004. The interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the
consolidated variable rate, tax-exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but, rather,
was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain
of our tax-exempt bond financings. Because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are
major financial institutions which have an A+ or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than
current market rates for such agreements, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a
default by a counterparty provider. Had these swap agreements not been in place during 2004 and
2003, our annual interest costs would have been approximately $2,769,000 and $6,027,000 lower,
respectively, based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable
years. However, if the variable interest rates on this debt had been 100 basis points higher
throughout 2004 and 2003 and these swap agreements had not been in place, our annual interest costs
would have been approximately $2,073,000 and $4,581,000 lower, respectively.

In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, which impacts
the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (excluding our
variable rate unsecured credit facility) with an aggregate carrying value of $2,340,843,000 at
December 31, 2004 had an estimated aggregate fair value of
$2,532,620,000 at December 31, 2004.
Fixed rate debt represented $2,123,669,000 of the carrying value and $2,246,602,000 of the fair
value at December 31, 2004. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of December 31,
2004, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by $101,157,000.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

. As required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company
carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.
Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. We continue to review and document our disclosure
controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, and may from time
to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve
with our business.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. Our management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with
the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on
that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
effective as of December 31, 2004.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.

(c)

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

. There was no change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the period covered by
this Annual Report on Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(2) Includes 106,857 deferred units granted under the 1994 Plan, which, subject to
vesting requirements, will convert in the future to common stock on a one-for-one basis, but does
not include 232,028 shares of restricted stock that are outstanding and that are already reflected
in the Company’s outstanding shares.

(3) Does not include outstanding options to acquire 186,262 shares, at a weighted-average
exercise price of $37.72 per share, that were assumed, in connection with the 1998 merger of Avalon
Properties, Inc. with and into the Company, under the Avalon Properties, Inc. 1995 Equity Incentive
Plan and the Avalon Properties, Inc. 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.


(4) Excludes deferred units granted under the 1994 Plan, which, subject to vesting
requirements, will convert in the future to common stock on a one-for-one basis.

(5) The 1994 Plan incorporates an evergreen formula pursuant to which the aggregate
number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan will increase annually. On each January
1, the aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan will increase by a
number of shares equal to a percentage (ranging from 0.48% to 1.00%) of all outstanding shares of
common stock at the end of the year. The exact percentage used is determined based on the
percentage of all awards made under the 1994 Plan during the calendar year that were in the form of
stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock on
the date of the grant. In accordance with this procedure, on January 1, 2005, the maximum number
of shares remaining available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan was increased by 599,306 to
2,910,555.

(6) Consists of the ESPP.

The ESPP, which was adopted by the Board of Directors on October 29, 1996, has not been approved by
our shareholders. A further description of the ESPP appears in Note 10, “Stock-Based Compensation
Plans,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of

AvalonBay Communities, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
operations and other comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of AvalonBay
Communities, Inc,’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
March 9, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9a., that AvalonBay Communities, Inc. maintained
 effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that AvalonBay Communities, Inc. maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the COSO criteria.  Also, in our opinion, AvalonBay Communities, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations and other
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2004 of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. and our report dated March 9, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

AVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context otherwise requires,
refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries) is a Maryland corporation
that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended. The Company focuses on the ownership and operation of apartment
communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. These markets are located in the
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions
of the country.

At December 31, 2004, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 138
operating apartment communities containing 40,142 apartment homes in ten states and the District of
Columbia, of which four communities containing 1,430 apartment homes were under reconstruction. In
addition, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in ten communities
under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 2,668 apartment homes when
completed. The Company also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an
additional 49 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated
13,491 apartment homes.

Principles of
Consolidation

The Company is the surviving corporation from the merger (the “Merger”) of Bay Apartment
Communities, Inc. (“Bay”) and Avalon Properties, Inc. (“Avalon”) on June 4, 1998, in which Avalon
shareholders received 0.7683 of a share of common stock of the Company for each share owned of
Avalon common stock. The Merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with
the historical financial statements for Avalon presented prior to the Merger. At that time, Avalon
ceased to legally exist, and Bay as the surviving legal entity adopted the historical financial
statements of Avalon. Consequently, Bay’s assets were recorded in the historical financial
statements of Avalon at an amount equal to Bay’s debt outstanding at that time plus the value of
capital stock retained by the Bay stockholders, which approximates fair value. In connection with
the Merger, the Company changed its name from Bay Apartment Communities, Inc. to AvalonBay
Communities, Inc.

The Company assesses consolidation of variable interest entities under the guidance of FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
of ARB No. 51,” as revised in December 2003. The Company accounts for joint venture partnerships
and subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs that are not variable interest entities in
accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate
Ventures.” Under SOP 78-9, the Company consolidates joint venture and DownREIT partnerships when
the Company controls the major operating and financial policies of the partnership through majority
ownership or in its capacity as general partner. The accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned partnerships, certain joint
venture partnerships, subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs and any variable interest
entities consolidated under FIN 46. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

In each of the partnerships structured as DownREITs, either the Company or one of the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more limited partners whose
interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each
DownREIT partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any
distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the
DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of
limited partnership interests have approximated the Company’s current common stock dividend per
share. Each DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners
will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the
partnership agreement. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to
present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the applicable
partnership agreement and based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock. In

F-8

lieu of a cash redemption, the Company may elect to acquire such units for an equal number of
shares of the Company’s common stock.

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities that are not variable interest
entities in accordance with SOP 78-9 and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The Company uses the equity method
to account for investments in which it owns greater than 20% of the equity value or has significant
and disproportionate influence over that entity. Investments in which the Company owns 20% or less
of the equity value and does not have significant and disproportionate influence are accounted for
using the cost method. If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the
value of an investment, the Company’s policy is to record the loss and reduce the value of the
investment to its fair value. A loss in value would be indicated if the Company could not recover
the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that
would justify the carrying amount of the investment. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company recorded an impairment loss of $1,002 related to a technology investment. The Company did
not recognize an impairment loss on any of its investments in unconsolidated entities during the
years ended December 31, 2003 or 2002.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in
accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.” In accordance with the
Company’s standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash
concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the
lease, which is generally one year.

Real Estate

Significant expenditures which improve or extend the life of an asset are capitalized. The
operating real estate assets are stated at cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements,
furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their development, redevelopment
and acquisition. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

The Company’s policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only
non-recurring expenditures. Improvements and upgrades are capitalized only if the item exceeds $15,
extends the useful life of the asset and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the
next resident. Purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, are capitalized
only if the item is a new addition and exceeds $2.5. The Company generally expenses purchases of
personal property made for replacement purposes.

The capitalization of costs during the development of assets (including interest and related loan
fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) begins when active development commences
and ends when the asset, or a portion of an asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use,
which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Cost capitalization
during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes
and other direct and indirect costs) begins when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for
redevelopment and ends when the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is
available for a new resident. Rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial
lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue.

In accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate
Projects,” the Company capitalizes pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development
opportunities for which the Company currently believes future development is probable (“Development
Rights”). Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors,
including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and
availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for
which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if
the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any
capitalized pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense. The Company expensed
costs related to abandoned pursuits, which includes the abandonment or impairment of Development
Rights, acquisition pursuits and

F-9

technology investments, in the amounts of $1,726, $1,180 and $2,800 for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Company owns three parcels of land improved with office buildings and industrial space occupied
by unrelated third-parties in connection with three Development Rights. The Company intends to
manage the current improvements until such time as all tenant obligations have been satisfied or
eliminated through negotiation, and construction of new apartment communities is ready to begin.
As provided under the guidance of SFAS No. 67, the revenue from incidental operations received from
the current improvements in excess of any incremental costs are being recorded as a reduction of
total capitalized costs of the Development Right and not as part of net income.

In connection with the acquisition of an operating community, the Company performs a valuation and
allocation to each asset and liability acquired in such transaction, based on their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations.” The
purchase price allocations to tangible assets, such as land, buildings and improvements, and
furniture, fixtures and equipment, are reflected in real estate assets and depreciated over their
estimated useful lives. Any purchase price allocation to intangible assets, such as in-place
leases, is included in prepaid expenses and other assets and amortized over the average remaining
lease term of the acquired leases. The fair value of acquired in-place leases is determined based
on the estimated cost to replace such leases, including foregone rents during an assumed re-lease
period, as well as the impact on projected cash flow of acquired leases with leased rents above or
below current market rents.

Depreciation is calculated on buildings and improvements using the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment
are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which
range from three years (primarily computer-related equipment) to seven years.

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of an
operating community, the Company’s policy is to assess any impairment in value by making a
comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining
useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying
amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community, the Company
would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount
to its estimated fair market value. The Company has not recognized an impairment loss on any of
its operating communities during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002. However, the
Company recognized an impairment loss in 2002 related to two land parcels. See Note 14,
“Subsequent Events.”

Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for
the year ended December 31, 1994 and has not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal
entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational
requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted
taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate
level federal income tax on taxable income it distributes currently to its stockholders. Management
believes that all such conditions for the avoidance of income taxes have been met for the periods
presented. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes has been made. If the
Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes
at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able
to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation
as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property,
and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable
income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal,
state and local income taxes.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain debt financing and are amortized
on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the shorter of the
term of the loan or the related credit enhancement facility, if applicable. Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date. Accumulated amortization of
deferred financing costs was $23,232 at December 31, 2004 and $19,266 at December 31, 2003.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Cash in Escrow

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less from the date acquired. The majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents
and cash in escrows is held at major commercial banks.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk and has
designated these financial instruments as hedges under the guidance of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities, an Amendment of Statement No. 133.” For fair value
hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair
value of the hedged item due to the risk being hedged are recognized in current period earnings.
For cash flow hedge transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are
reported in other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges where the changes in the fair value
of the derivative exceed the change in fair value of the hedged item, the ineffective portion is
recognized in current period earnings. Derivatives which are not part of a hedge relationship are
recorded at fair value through earnings. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had approximately
$236,000 in variable rate debt subject to cash flow hedges. See Note 5, “Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.”

F-11

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other
Comprehensive Income, is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for those
resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive
loss as reflected on  the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’
Equity reflects on the changes in the
fair value of effective cash flow hedges.

Earnings per Common Share

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” basic earnings per share
is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related
impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. The
Company’s earnings per common share are determined as follows:

Certain options to purchase shares of common stock in the amounts of 6,000, 1,348,738 and 1,410,397
were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, but were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise prices
were greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period and therefore, are
anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to 2003, the Company applied the intrinsic value method as provided in APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in accounting for its
employee stock options. No stock-based employee compensation cost related to employee stock
options is reflected in net income for the year ended December 31, 2002, as all options granted had
an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.
Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,”
prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled on or after January 1, 2003.
Awards under the Company’s stock option plans vest over periods ranging from one to three years.
Therefore, the cost related to stock-based employee compensation for employee stock options
included in the determination of net income for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, is less
than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all
awards since the original effective date of SFAS No. 123.

F-12

The following table illustrates the effect on net income available to common stockholders and
earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested
awards in each period based on the fair market value as determined on the date of grant:

Insured Loss

During 2000, a fire occurred at one of the Company’s development communities, which was under
construction and unoccupied at the time. The Company had property damage and insurance for lost rental income which
covered this event. Insurance proceeds totaling $30,300 were received, of which $22,000 was
disbursed to rebuild the community for property damage. Insurance proceeds for lost rental income
of $5,800 are included in rental and other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Other Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2002.

Variable Interest Entities under FIN 46

The Company adopted the final provisions of FIN 46 as of January 1, 2004, which resulted in the
consolidation of one entity during 2004 from which the Company held a
participating mortgage note,
as discussed in Note 12, “Related Party Arrangements.” The consolidation of this entity resulted
in an increase to net real estate assets of approximately $33,000 and the elimination of the
previously recorded mortgage note and accrued interest of approximately $27,300. In addition, the
Company recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the year ended
December 31, 2004 in the amount of $4,547, which increased earnings per common share — diluted by
$0.06. The Company did not hold an equity interest in this entity, and therefore 100% of the
entity’s net income or loss was recognized by the Company as minority interest in consolidated
partnerships on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. In
October 2004, the Company received payment in full of the
outstanding mortgage note. Upon note repayment, the Company did not continue to hold a variable interest in this entity and therefore
the Company discontinued consolidating the entity under the provisions of FIN 46.

Discontinued Operations

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of
any communities which have been sold since January 1, 2002, or otherwise qualify as held for sale,
be presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in both
current and prior years presented. The community specific components of net income that are
presented as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation expense, minority
interest expense and interest expense. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment
loss) on the eventual disposal of communities held for sale will be presented as discontinued
operations when recognized. A change in presentation for discontinued operations will not have any
impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Real estate assets held for
sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell, and
are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to
classification of a community as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded.

F-13

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS
No. 123(R), “Share
Based Payment,” a revision of SFAS No. 123, which is similar in concept to SFAS No. 123, but
requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no
longer an alternative. This revision is effective in the first interim or annual reporting period
beginning after June 15, 2005. As the Company has already adopted the fair value provisions of
SFAS No. 123, this revision is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years’ financial statements to conform
with current year presentations.

(2) Balance at December 31, 2003 includes $38,735 related to real estate assets sold in 2004.

The following debt activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2004:

•

The Company repaid $125,000 in previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid
interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity, and no prepayment penalties were incurred.
In addition, the Company issued $150,000 in unsecured notes under its existing shelf
registration statement at an annual interest rate of 5.375%. Interest on these notes is
payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, and they mature in April 2014;

•

The Company repaid $24,251 in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by two current
communities, along with any unpaid interest, repaid $10,400 in variable rate, tax-exempt
debt related to the sale of one

F-14

community and transferred $28,335 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to the sale of
two communities to the respective buyers;

•

The Company issued $82,800 in variable rate, conventional debt on three communities,
including interest rate protection agreements that serve to effectively limit the level to
which interest rates can rise. This debt has a weighted average variable interest rate of
3.8% as of December 31, 2004, and the Hedged Derivatives limit the level to which interest
rates can rise on this debt to a weighted average rate of 8.5%;

•

The Company obtained a $50,000 secured construction loan for the construction of a
development community that will be owned and operated in a joint venture entity upon
completion (See Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities”).
Outstanding draws will bear interest at a variable rate and will come due in March 2008,
assuming the exercise of two one-year extension options. The Company has $6,278
outstanding under this construction loan as of December 31, 2004;

•

The Company issued $16,765 in fixed rate, conventional mortgage debt on one community;

•

The Company assumed $8,155 in fixed rate, conventional mortgage debt in conjunction
with the acquisition of a community;

•

The Company assumed $20,141 in fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition of
three parcels of improved land related to three Development Rights;

•

The Company replaced the credit enhancements, including interest rate swaps, on
approximately $87,000 of its variable rate, tax-exempt debt when such credit enhancements
expired, of which $9,580 was transferred upon the sale of a community to the respective
purchaser. The Company put in place interest rate protection agreements that serve to
effectively limit the level to which interest rates can rise on the remaining debt to a
range of 6.9% to 9.0%. This variable rate, tax-exempt debt floats at an average coupon
interest rate of 2.5% as of December 31, 2004; and

•

The Company renegotiated the terms of a fixed rate, tax-exempt bond on one community in
the amount of $9,780 to decrease the annual interest rate from 7.0% to 4.9%.

In the aggregate, mortgage notes payable mature at various dates from April 2005 through April 2043
and are secured by certain apartment communities (with a net carrying
value of $782,498 as of December 31, 2004). As of December 31, 2004, the Company has
guaranteed approximately $109,000 of mortgage notes payable held by wholly-owned subsidiaries; all
such mortgage notes payable are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The weighted
average interest rate of the Company’s fixed rate mortgage notes payable (conventional and
tax-exempt) was 6.7% at both December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. The weighted average
interest rate of the Company’s variable rate mortgage notes payable and its unsecured credit
facility (as discussed on the following page), including the effect of certain financing related fees, was 3.9% at
December 31, 2004 and 3.5% at December 31, 2003.

The Company’s unsecured notes contain a number of financial and other covenants with which the
Company must comply, including, but not limited to, limits on the aggregate amount of total and
secured indebtedness the Company may have on a consolidated basis and limits on the Company’s
required debt service payments.

The Company has a $500,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase
Bank and Wachovia Bank, N.A. serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial
banks. The Company had $102,000 outstanding under the facility and $26,580 in letters of credit on
December 31, 2004 and $51,100 outstanding and $19,901 in letters of credit on December 31, 2003.
Under the terms of the credit facility, if the Company elects to increase the facility by up to an
additional $150,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to
provide the additional commitment, then the Company will be able to increase the facility up to
$650,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in
the facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to
commit to lend additional funds. The Company pays participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual
facility fee of approximately $750 in quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility bears
interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), rating levels
achieved on the Company’s unsecured notes and on a maturity
schedule selected by the Company. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.55% per annum (2.95%
on December 31, 2004). The spread over LIBOR can vary from LIBOR plus 0.50% to LIBOR plus 1.15%
based upon the rating of the Company’s long-term unsecured debt. In addition, the unsecured credit
facility includes a competitive bid option, which allows banks that are part of the lender
consortium to bid to make loans to the Company at a rate that is lower than the stated rate
provided by the unsecured credit facility for up to $250,000. The competitive bid option may
result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. The Company has $20,000 outstanding under this
competitive bid option as of December 31, 2004 priced at LIBOR plus 0.29%, or 1.88%. The Company
is subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility, including, but
not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio
and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends in
amounts that exceed 95% of the Company’s Funds from Operations, as defined therein, except as may
be required to maintain the Company’s REIT status. The credit facility matures in May 2008,
assuming exercise of a one-year renewal option by the Company.

Stockholders’ Equity

As of both December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company had authorized for issuance 140,000,000 and
50,000,000 shares of common and preferred stock, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 the
Company has the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at a stated value of
$100,000. This series has no stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory
redemptions.

Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue and are payable
quarterly in arrears on or before the 15th day of each month as stated in the table above. The
preferred stock is not redeemable prior to the date stated in the table above, but on or after the
stated date, may be redeemed for cash at the option of the Company in whole or in part at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, if any.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company (i) issued 1,455,379 shares of common stock in
connection with stock options exercised, (ii) issued 104,160 shares of common stock in exchange for
the redemption of an equal number of DownREIT limited partnership units, (iii) issued 14,476 shares
to employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (iv) issued 1,545 shares through the Company’s
dividend reinvestment plan, (v) issued 147,517 common shares in connection with stock grants to
employees of which 80% are restricted, (vi) had forfeitures of 3,012 shares of restricted stock
grants to employees and (vii) withheld 75,515 shares to satisfy employees’ tax withholding and
other liabilities.

Dividends per common share for each of the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $2.80
per share. In 2004, average dividends for all non-redeemed preferred shares during the year were
$2.18 per share, and no preferred shares were redeemed. In 2003, average dividends for preferred
shares redeemed during the year were $0.27 per share and average dividends for all non-redeemed
preferred shares were $2.18 per share. In 2002, average dividends for preferred shares redeemed
during the year were $0.92 per share and average dividends for all non-redeemed preferred shares
were $2.10 per share.

In March 2004, the Company announced that it would resume its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan (the “DRIP”). The DRIP allows for holders of the Company’s common stock or preferred
stock to purchase shares of common stock through either reinvested dividends or optional cash
payments. The purchase price per share for newly issued shares of common stock under the DRIP will
be equal to the last reported sale price for a share of the Company’s common stock as reported by
the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on the applicable investment date. The DRIP was effective
beginning with the Company’s common stock dividend for the three months ended June 30, 2004.

5.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company has historically used interest rate swap and cap agreements (collectively, the “Hedged
Derivatives”) to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate, tax-exempt
bonds and its variable rate conventional secured debt. The Company has not entered into any
interest rate hedge agreements or treasury locks for its conventional unsecured debt and does not
hold interest rate hedge agreements for trading or other speculative purposes. As of December 31,
2004, the Hedged Derivatives fix approximately $69,000 of the Company’s tax-exempt debt at a
weighted average interest rate of 6.3% through interest rate swaps. In addition, as of December
31, 2004, the Company has Hedged Derivatives on $166,733 of its variable rate debt, which floats at
a weighted average coupon interest rate of 3.2% and has been capped at a weighted average interest
rate of 8.0% through interest rate caps. These Hedged Derivatives have maturity dates ranging from
2007 to 2010. In addition, one of the Company’s unconsolidated real estate investments (see Note
6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities”) has $22,500 in variable rate debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2004, which is subject to an interest rate swap. This debt is not
recourse to or guaranteed by the Company. The Hedged Derivatives are accounted for in accordance
with SFAS No. 133, which as

F-17

amended, was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires that every
derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at
its fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge
accounting criteria are met.

The Company has determined that its Hedged Derivatives qualify as effective cash-flow hedges under
SFAS No. 133, resulting in the Company recording all changes in the fair value of the Hedged
Derivatives in other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be
reclassified into earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flow.
To adjust the Hedged Derivatives to their fair value, the Company recorded unrealized gains to
other comprehensive income of $1,116 and $4,428 during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and an unrealized loss of $4,157 in the year ended December 31, 2002. The estimated
amount, included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2004, expected to be
reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months to offset the variability of cash flow
during this period is not material.

The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going basis, the effectiveness of all hedges
in offsetting cash flow of hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a material impact on
earnings and the Company does not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the future.
The fair values of the obligations under the Hedged Derivatives are included in accrued expenses
and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, the
Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. The credit risk is the risk of a
counterparty not performing under the terms of the Hedged Derivatives. The counterparties to these
Hedged Derivatives are major financial institutions which have an A+ or better credit rating by the
Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group. The Company monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and the
amount of the Company’s debt subject to Hedged Derivatives with any one party. Therefore, the
Company believes the likelihood of realizing material losses from counterparty non-performance is
remote. Market risk is the adverse effect of the value of financial instruments that results from
a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by
the establishment and monitoring of parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that
may be undertaken. These risks are managed by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Senior
Vice President — Finance.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate
entities, which are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, except as described below:

•

Town Run Associates

was formed as a general partnership in November 1994 to develop,
own and operate Avalon Run, a 426 apartment-home community located in Lawrenceville,
New Jersey. Since formation of this venture, the Company has invested $1,803 and,
following a preferred return on all contributed equity (which was not achieved in
2004), has a 40% ownership and cash flow interest with a 49% residual economic
interest. The Company is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the
Avalon Run community and is the management agent subject to the terms of a management
agreement. The development of Avalon Run was funded entirely through equity
contributions from Avalon as well as the other venture partner, and therefore Avalon Run
is not subject to any outstanding debt as of December 31, 2004.

•

Town Grove, LLC

was formed as a limited liability corporation in December 1997 to
develop, own and operate Avalon Grove, a 402 apartment-home community located in
Stamford, Connecticut. Since formation of this venture, the Company has invested
$14,653 and, following a preferred return on all contributed equity (which was achieved
in 2004), has a 50% ownership and a 50% cash flow and residual economic interest. The
Company is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Avalon Grove community and
is the management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement. The
development of Avalon Grove was funded through contributions from the Company and the
other venture partner, and therefore Avalon Grove is not subject to any outstanding
debt as of December 31, 2004.

F-18

F-19

be a 211 apartment-home community located in Kirkland, Washington. Upon
contribution of the community to the joint venture, the Company expects to be
reimbursed for all costs incurred to develop the community. The third-party joint
venture partner will receive a 100% equity interest in the joint venture and will
manage the joint venture. The Company will receive a residual profits interest and
will be engaged to manage the community for a property management fee. The Company
will consolidate this community until it is contributed into the joint venture at
construction completion.

•

Mission Bay Venture Partners, LLC

— In December 2004, the Company entered into a joint
venture agreement with an unrelated third-party for the development of Avalon at
Mission Bay North II. Avalon at Mission Bay North II, if developed as expected, will
be a 313 apartment-home community located in San Francisco, California. The Company
holds a 25% equity interest in this joint venture entity with the remaining 75% equity
interest held by the third-party. The Company expects that construction of Avalon at
Mission Bay North II will begin in early 2005, with approximately 80% of the projected
capitalized cost financed through a construction loan.

The Company also holds a 25%
limited liability company membership interest in AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC, the limited liability
company that owns Avalon on the Sound. The Company, which originally
owned 100% of AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC, sold a 75% controlling interest in AvalonBay Redevelopment, LLC to a
third-party in 2000. As part of the sale, the Company retained an option to repurchase the 75%
interest. In accordance with SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” the sale of the
75% interest was not recognized due to the existence of the repurchase option, which expired in
December 2004. Therefore, for periods prior to December 31, 2004, the Company accounted for Avalon
on the Sound as a profit-sharing arrangement. As a result, the revenues and expenses, and assets
and liabilities of Avalon on the Sound were included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements, with the 75% interest presented as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities on
the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003. The income allocated to the
controlling partner is shown as venture partner interest in profit-sharing on the Company’s
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income for the years ended December
31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Due to the expiration of the repurchase option, the Company stopped
accounting for its

F-20

interest in Avalon on the Sound as a profit-sharing arrangement effective December 31, 2004. The
Company will account for its interest in Avalon on the Sound under the equity method of accounting
in future periods, unless the joint venture arrangement is modified to require consolidation, and
therefore the Company’s investment in Avalon on the Sound is included in investment in
unconsolidated real estate entities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004.
Avalon on the Sound has net real estate of $80,685 and outstanding debt of $36,124 as of December
31, 2004, which is not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company is
currently in negotiations with the third-party partner to repurchase its 75% equity interest,
although there can be no assurance that such repurchase will occur.

Investments in Unconsolidated Non-Real Estate Entities

At December 31, 2004, the Company held a minority interest investment in one non-real estate
entity, which is a technology investment. Based on ownership and control criteria, the Company
accounts for this investment using the cost method. The aggregate carrying value of the Company’s
investment in unconsolidated non-real estate entities was $454 and $1,456 as of December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Prior to December 31, 2004, the Company held an ownership interest in two
additional non-real estate entities, one of which was accounted for under the equity method.
During 2004, the Company was notified that the technology investment in which it held a minority
interest as of December 31, 2004 was in negotiations to be acquired by a third-party. See Note 14,
“Subsequent Events.”

The Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include other assets (excluding net real estate) of $0
and $1,569, other liabilities of $0 and $1,338 and mortgage notes payable of $0 and $38,735 as of
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively, relating to real estate assets sold.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had one community that qualified as held for sale under the
provisions of SFAS No. 144. However, due to changes in economic conditions, the Company ceased
pursuing the disposition of the community during 2004. This community has been reclassified as
held for operating purposes at its carrying amount prior to being classified as held for sale,
adjusted for suspended depreciation, which is less than the current fair value.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company sold one parcel of land, as well as certain
transferable development rights acquired with an adjacent parcel of land on which a current
operating community was developed, for a gross sales price of $9,927. The sale of the land parcel
and transferable development rights resulted in an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of $1,138
and net proceeds of $9,648. In 2003, the Company sold one land parcel, which was originally owned
by the Company in connection with a development right in Oakland, California, for which net
proceeds of approximately $6,600 were received upon sale and a gain in accordance with GAAP of
$1,234 was recognized.

Commitments and Contingencies

Employment Agreements and Arrangements

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had employment agreements with five executive officers. The
employment agreements provide for severance payments and generally provide for accelerated vesting
of stock options and restricted stock in the event of a termination of employment (except for a
termination by the Company with cause or a voluntary termination by the employee). The current
term of these agreements ends on dates that vary between April 2005 and November 2006. The
employment agreements provide for one-year automatic renewals (two years in the case of the Chief
Executive Officer (“CEO”)) after the initial term unless an advance notice of non-renewal is
provided by either party. Upon a notice of non-renewal by the Company, each of the officers may
terminate his employment and receive a severance payment. Upon a change in control, the agreements
provide for an automatic extension of up to three years from the date of the change in control.
The employment agreements provide for base salary and incentive compensation in the form of cash
awards, stock options and stock grants subject to the discretion of, and attainment of performance
goals established by, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

F-22

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company adopted an Officer Severance Program (the “Program”)
for the benefit of those officers of the Company who do not have employment agreements. Under the
Program, in the event an officer who is not otherwise covered by a severance arrangement is
terminated (other than for cause) within two years of a change in control (as defined) of the
Company, such officer will generally receive a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of such
officer’s base salary and cash bonus, as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and
restricted stock. Costs related to the Company’s employment
agreements and the Program are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” and therefore are
recognized when considered by management to be probable and estimable.

Legal Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it has been determined that a
loss is probable to occur, the estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial
statements. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
position or results of operations of the Company.

The Company is currently
involved in construction litigation with a general contractor and a
surety bond provider related to a
community that has since completed development. A non-jury trial
ended in April 2004, and in May 2004, the court issued a ruling,
finding that these parties were liable to the Company for
consequential damages due to breach of contract and other failures
to perform. The court issued a ruling in October 2004, awarding the
Company approximately $1,250 plus interest. However, the Company has
determined that it will file an appeal to seek an increase in the
damage award. There is no guarantee that a higher, or any, damage
award, will be received by the Company after all appeals are filed and a
final ruling is provided.

Lease Obligations

The Company owns six apartment communities which are located on land subject to land leases
expiring between July 2029 and March 2142. In addition, the Company leases certain office space.
These leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for
Leases.” The Company incurred costs of $4,399, $3,348 and $1,931 in the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to these leases.

The following table details the future minimum lease payments under the Company’s current operating
leases:

Segment Reporting

The Company’s reportable operating segments include Established Communities, Other Stabilized
Communities, and Development/Redevelopment Communities. Annually as of January 1

st

, the
Company determines which of its communities fall into each of these categories and maintains that
classification, unless disposition plans regarding a community change, throughout the year for the
purpose of reporting segment operations.

•

Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities)

are communities where
a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is
meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating
expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. For the year 2004, the Established
Communities are communities that had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of
January 1, 2003, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment
activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current
year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i)
attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of
development or redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all other completed communities that have
stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include
communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment
activities within the current year.

•

Development/Redevelopment Communities

consists of communities that are under
construction and have not received a final certificate of occupancy, communities where
substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year
and communities under lease-up, that had not reached stabilized occupancy, as defined
above, as of January 1, 2004.

F-23

In addition, the Company owns land held for future development and has other corporate assets that
are not allocated to an operating segment.

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information,” requires that segment disclosures present the

measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes
of assessing such segments’ performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is comprised
of several members of its executive management team who use Net Operating Income (“NOI”) as the
primary financial measure for Established and Other Stabilized Communities. NOI is defined by the
Company as total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and
excludes corporate-level property management and other indirect
operating expenses, investments and
investment management, interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, equity in
income of unconsolidated entities, minority interest in consolidated partnerships, venture partner
interest in profit-sharing, depreciation expense, cumulative effect of change in accounting
principle, gain on sale of real estate assets and income from discontinued operations. Although
the Company considers NOI a useful measure of a community’s or communities’ operating performance,
NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating
activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP.

A reconciliation of NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is as

The primary performance measure for communities under development or redevelopment depends on the
stage of completion. While under development, management monitors actual construction costs
against budgeted costs as well as lease-up pace and rent levels compared to budget.

F-24

The following table provides details of the Company’s segment information as of the dates
specified. The segments are classified based on the individual community’s status as of the
beginning of the given calendar year. Therefore, each year the composition of communities within
each business segment is adjusted. Accordingly, the amounts between years are not directly
comparable. The accounting policies applicable to the operating segments described above are the
same as those described in Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.” Segment
information for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 has been adjusted for the
communities that were sold from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2004 as described in Note 7,
“Discontinued Operations — Real Estate Assets Sold or Held for Sale.”

(1)

Does not include gross real estate assets for discontinued operations of $141,588 and $439,903 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(2)

Revenue and NOI amounts represent third-party management, accounting and developer fees which are not allocated to a reportable segment.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has a stock incentive plan (the “1994 Plan”), which was amended and restated on
December 8, 2004. Individuals who are eligible to participate in the 1994 Plan include officers,
other associates, outside directors and other key persons of the Company and its subsidiaries who
are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth or profitability of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The 1994 Plan authorizes (i) the grant of stock options that qualify as incentive
stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code (“ISOs”), (ii) the grant of stock
options that do not so qualify, (iii) grants of shares of restricted and unrestricted common stock,
(iv) grants of deferred stock awards, (v) performance share awards entitling the recipient to
acquire shares of common stock and (vi) dividend equivalent rights.

Shares of common stock of 2,311,249, 2,358,393 and 2,084,207 were available for future option or
restricted stock grant awards under the 1994 Plan as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. On each January 1, the maximum number available for issuance under the 1994 Plan is
increased by between 0.48% and 1.00% of the total number of shares of common stock and DownREIT
units actually outstanding on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum number of
shares of stock for which ISOs may be issued under the 1994 Plan shall not exceed 2,500,000 and no
awards shall be granted under the 1994 Plan after May 11, 2011. Options and restricted stock
granted under the 1994 Plan vest and expire over varying periods, as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Before the Merger, Avalon had adopted its 1995 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Avalon 1995 Incentive
Plan”). Under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan, a maximum number of 3,315,054 shares (or 2,546,956
shares as adjusted for the Merger) of common stock were issuable, plus any shares of common stock
represented by awards under Avalon’s 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Avalon 1993 Plan”)
that were forfeited, canceled, reacquired by Avalon, satisfied without the issuance of common stock
or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise). Options granted to officers, non-employee
directors and associates under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan generally vested over a three-year
term, expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date
of grant.

In connection with the Merger, the exercise prices and the number of options under the Avalon 1995
Incentive Plan and the Avalon 1993 Plan were adjusted to reflect the equivalent Bay shares and
exercise prices based on the 0.7683 share conversion ratio used in the Merger. Officers,
non-employee directors and associates with Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan or Avalon 1993 Plan options
may exercise their adjusted number of options for the Company’s common stock at the adjusted
exercise price. As of June 4, 1998, the date of the Merger, options and other awards ceased to be
granted under the Avalon 1993 Plan or the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan. Accordingly, there were no
options to purchase shares of common stock available for grant under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan
or the Avalon 1993 Plan at December 31, 2004, 2003 or 2002.

For options outstanding at
December 31, 2004 under the 1994 Plan, 945,976 options had exercise
prices ranging between $25.38 and $39.99 and a weighted average contractual life of 5.2 years,
787,633 options had exercise prices ranging between $40.00 and $49.99 and a weighted average
contractual life of 6.7 years, and 543,209 options had exercise prices ranging between $50.00 and
$59.42 and a weighted average contractual life of 9.1 years. Options outstanding at December 31,
2004 for the Avalon 1993 and Avalon 1995 Plans had exercise prices ranging from $28.15 to $36.61
and a weighted average contractual life of 3.0 years.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
123 prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or settled on or after January 1, 2003.
The effect on net income available to common stockholders and earnings per share if the fair value
based method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each year based on the fair
market value as determined on the date of grant is reflected in Note 1, “Organization and
Significant Accounting Policies.”

The weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2004 is estimated at $3.87 per share
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted
average assumptions: dividend yield of 6.05% over the expected life of the option, volatility of
17.28%, risk-free interest rates of 3.58% and an expected life of approximately 7 years. The
weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2003 is estimated at $1.94 per share on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: dividend yield of 7.56% over the expected life of the option, volatility of 18.68%,
risk-free interest rates of 3.31% and an expected life of approximately 7 years. The weighted
average fair value of the options granted during 2002 is estimated at $4.52 per share on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions: dividend yield of 6.15% over the expected life of the option, volatility of 18.90%,
risk-free interest rates of 4.81% and an expected life of approximately 7 years. The cost related
to stock-based employee compensation for employee stock options included in the determination of
net income is based on actual forfeitures for the given year.

In October 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as
amended, the “ESPP”). Initially 1,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under
this plan. There are currently 813,514 shares remaining available for issuance under the plan.
Full-time employees of the Company

F-27

generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if, as of the last day of the applicable election
period, they have been employed by the Company for at least one month. All other employees of the
Company are eligible to participate provided that as of the applicable election period they have
been employed by the Company for twelve months. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are permitted
to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions, subject to maximum
purchase limitations. The purchase period is a period of seven months beginning each May 1 and
ending each November 30. The purchase price for common stock purchased under the plan is 85% of
the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
applicable purchase period or the last day of the applicable purchase period. The offering dates,
purchase dates and duration of purchase periods may be changed by the Board of Directors, if the
change is announced prior to the beginning of the affected date or purchase period. The Company
issued 14,476 shares, 14,393 shares and 29,345 shares and recognized compensation expense of $109,
$95 and $152 under the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
The Company accounts for transactions under the ESPP using the fair value method prescribed under
SFAS No. 123, as further discussed in Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.”

11.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Cash and cash equivalent balances are held with various financial institutions and may at times
exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. The Company monitors credit
ratings of these financial institutions and the concentration of cash and cash equivalent balances
with any one financial institution and believes the likelihood of realizing material losses from
the excess of cash and cash equivalent balances over insurance limits is remote.

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by management using
available market information and established valuation methodologies, including discounted cash
flow. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the
Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts.

•

Cash equivalents, rents receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses,
and other liabilities are carried at their face amounts, which reasonably
approximate their fair values.

•

Bond indebtedness and notes payable with an aggregate carrying value of
approximately $2,341,000 and $2,286,000 had an estimated aggregate fair value
of $2,533,000 and $2,556,000 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

12.

Related Party Arrangements

Purchase of Mortgage Note

Concurrent with its initial public offering in November 1993, Avalon purchased an existing
participating mortgage note made to Arbor Commons Associates Limited Partnership (“Arbor Commons
Associates”), which owns Avalon Arbor, a 302 apartment home community in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.
Prior to May 2004, the Company’s Chairman and CEO held an equity interest in the general partner
of Arbor Commons Associates; in May 2004, the Company’s Chairman and CEO fully disposed of his
equity interests. This mortgage note accrued interest at a fixed rate of 10.2% per annum, payable
at 9.0% per annum, was due to mature in November 2005 and was secured by the interest in Avalon
Arbor. As of December 31, 2003, the Company reported a note receivable of $21,483 and accrued
interest on the note of $5,834. Related interest income for the years ended December 31, 2003 and
2002 was $3,168 and $3,091, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2004, the Company consolidated the
financial position and results of operations of Arbor Commons Associates under the requirements of
FIN 46 as discussed in Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.” As such, the
related interest income during the year ended December 31, 2004 has been eliminated in
consolidation. On October 15, 2004, the Company received payment
in full for the mortgage note and
all accrued interest of $33,994, including a prepayment premium of approximately $1,240, net of
legal costs associated with the prepayment negotiations.

F-28

Unconsolidated Entities

The Company manages several unconsolidated real estate joint venture entities for which it receives
management fee revenue. From these entities the Company received management fee revenue of $683,
$851 and $1,019 in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.

In addition, in connection with the general contractor services that the Company provides to CVP I,
LLC, the entity that owns and is developing Avalon Chrystie Place I as discussed in Note 6,
“Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,” the Company has funded certain construction costs on
behalf of CVP I, LLC during 2004 and will be reimbursed through draws on the related construction
loan. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has recorded a receivable from CVP I, LLC in the amount
of $19,983, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Indebtedness of Management

The Company had a recourse loan program under which the Company lent amounts to or on behalf of
employees (“Stock Loans”) equivalent to the estimated employees’ tax withholding liabilities
related to the vesting of restricted stock under the 1994 Plan. In accordance with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to senior officers were renewed after January 1, 2003 and all
were repaid in full by March 31, 2003. The Company has phased out the Stock Loan program for all
other participants, and all loans were repaid by March 1, 2004.

Director Compensation

The Company’s 1994 Plan provides that directors of the Company who are also employees receive no
additional compensation for their services as a director. In accordance with the Company’s 1994
Plan, as then in effect, on the fifth business day following the Company’s May 2003 Annual Meeting
of Stockholders, each of the Company’s non-employee directors automatically received options to
purchase 7,000 shares of common stock at the last reported sale price of the common stock on the
NYSE on such date, and a restricted stock grant (or, in lieu thereof, a deferred stock award) of
2,500 shares of common stock. On May 14, 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an
amendment to the 1994 Plan pursuant to which, in lieu of the stock and option awards described
above, each non-employee director would receive, following the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
and each annual meeting thereafter, (i) a number of shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock
awards) having a value of $100 based on the last reported sale price of the common stock on the
NYSE on the fifth business day following the prior year’s annual meeting and (ii) $30 cash, payable
in quarterly installments of $7.5. A non-employee director may elect to receive all or a portion
of such cash payment in the form of a deferred stock award. In addition, the Lead Independent
Director receives an annual fee of $30 payable in equal monthly installments of $2.5. The Company
recorded compensation expense relating to the restricted stock grants, deferred stock awards and
stock options in the amount of $940, $824 and $743 in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Deferred compensation relating to these restricted stock grants, deferred
stock awards and stock options was $748 and $722 on December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Investment in Realeum, Inc.

As an employee incentive and retention mechanism, the Company arranged for officers of the Company
to hold direct or indirect interests in the common stock of Realeum, Inc (“Realeum”). Realeum is a
company involved in the development and deployment of a property management and leasing automation
system in which the Company invested $2,300 in January 2002. In April 2004, Realeum was merged
into a third-party, and in connection with such merger, all shares of Realeum common stock
(including those held directly or indirectly by officers of the Company) were cancelled without
payment of consideration. The Company still utilizes the property management and leasing
automation system and has paid $516, $471 and $480 to Realeum under the terms of its licensing
arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Subsequent Events

In January 2005, the Company repaid $150,000 of previously issued unsecured notes, along with any
unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity and no prepayment penalties were incurred.

In February 2005, the technology investment in which the Company held an ownership interest as of
December 31, 2004 was acquired by a third-party. As a result of this transaction, the Company
received net proceeds of approximately $6,700 and expects to recognize a non-routine gain on the
sale of this investment of approximately $6,250.

In February 2005, the Company announced certain management changes, including the departure of a
senior executive. The Company is currently negotiating the definitive
terms of this executive’s departure and on-going relationship
post-departure. The Company expects that it will enter into a
consulting services arrangement with this executive, pursuant to
which he will provide consulting and transitional development
services following his departure; however, there is no guarantee that
such a consulting arrangement will be put into place. The Company
expects that this executive will receive a cash payment of
approximately $2,000 and he will retain and receive accelerated
vesting of his equity based compensation awards,
as well as certain prorated compensation through his expected
departure date of April 30, 2005.

As of February 28, 2005, two communities previously held for operating purposes were classified as
held for sale under SFAS No. 144. These communities have a net real estate carrying value of
$40,675 as of December 31, 2004. The Company is actively pursuing the disposition of these
communities and expects to close during the first half of 2005.

As discussed in Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies,” the Company recorded an
impairment loss in the year ended December 31, 2002 related to two land parcels. As of December
31, 2002, the Company determined that these two land parcels were not likely to proceed to
development, and although they did not qualify as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No.
144, they were planned for disposition. Therefore, the Company performed an analysis of the
carrying value of these land parcels in connection with this change in anticipated use. As a
result, the Company recorded an impairment loss to reflect these parcels at fair market value,
based on their entitlement status as of December 31, 2002. As of February 28, 2005, the Company is
under contract to sell one of these parcels of land. Due to changes in economic conditions since
2002, the disposition of this parcel of land at the current contracted sales price would result in
the recovery of the previously recognized impairment loss. However, there can be no assurance that
such a sale will occur.

In March 2005, the Company
issued $100,000 in unsecured notes under its existing shelf
registration statement at an annual effective interest rate of 4.999%. Interest
on these notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15,
and they mature in March 2013.
