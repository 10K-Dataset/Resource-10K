Portions of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.'s Proxy Statement for the


annual meeting of stockholders, a definitive copy of which will be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the year end of the year covered by this Form 10-K, are incorporated by reference herein as portions of Part III of this Form 10-K.




PART I

This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in each forward-looking statement. Certain factors that might cause such a difference are discussed in this report, including in the section entitled "Forward-Looking Statements" included in this Form 10-K. You should also review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of various risks that could adversely affect us.

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

General

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries), is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes.  We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California. We focus on leading metropolitan areas in these regions that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life.  We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community investments relative to other markets.

At

January 31, 2015

, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in:

•


operating apartment communities containing

74,240

apartment homes in


states and the District of Columbia, of which


communities containing

66,631

apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes,

two

communities containing


apartment homes were held by joint ventures in which we hold an ownership interest, and


communities containing

6,991

apartment homes were owned by the Funds (as defined below).


of the consolidated communities containing

3,998

apartment homes were under redevelopment, as discussed below;

•


wholly-owned communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of

7,924

apartment homes when completed; and

•

rights to develop an additional


communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated

10,384

apartment homes; and

•

an indirect interest in the Residual JV (as defined in this Form 10-K) which owns direct and indirect interests in assets acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition (as defined in this Form 10-K), including

two

land parcels and an indirect interest in a joint venture which owns

four

apartment communities with

1,410

apartment homes in the United States.

Any discussion of apartment communities and homes as of

December 31, 2014

and

January 31, 2015

includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater in January 2015.

We generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we intend to raze, or by acquiring an existing community. In selecting sites for development or acquisition, we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation, recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.

Our consolidated real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments: Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities and Development/Redevelopment Communities.

Established Communities are generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year such that year-over-year comparisons are meaningful. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but that were not owned or had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year such that year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful, as well as communities that are planned for disposition during the current year. Development/Redevelopment Communities consist of communities that are under construction, communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under lease-up. A more detailed description of these segments and other related information can be found in Note 9, "Segment Reporting," of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.



Our principal financial goal is to increase long-term stockholder value through the development, redevelopment, acquisition, operation and when appropriate, disposition of apartment communities in our markets. To help meet this goal, we regularly (i) monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type, (ii) develop, redevelop and acquire an interest in apartment communities in our selected markets, (iii) selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and (iv) endeavor to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks with a view to maintaining continuous access to cost-effective capital. Our strategy is to be leaders in multifamily market research, consumer insight and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing U.S. submarkets. A substantial majority of our current communities are upscale, which generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services.

We operate our apartment communities under three core brands

Avalon, AVA

and

Eaves by Avalon.

We believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint. The

"Avalon"

brand is our core offering, focusing on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services in urban and suburban markets. Our

"AVA"

brand is designed for people who want to live in or near urban neighborhoods and in close proximity to public transportation, services, shopping and night-life.

AVA

apartments are generally smaller, many engineered for roommate living and feature modern design and a technology focus. Our

Eaves by Avalon

brand is designed for renters who seek good quality apartment living, often in a suburban setting, with practical amenities and services at a more modest price point.

During the

three years ended December 31, 2014

, excluding activity for the Funds (as defined below), we acquired


apartment communities, of which


were acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition (as defined in this Form 10-K). In addition, in 2013 in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, excluding the Residual JV, we acquired interests in

three

unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as the Residual JV, as discussed below, which as of

December 31, 2014

own an aggregate of


apartment communities. During the

three years ended December 31, 2014

, we disposed of


apartment communities,

six

of which were acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, and completed the development of


apartment communities and the redevelopment of


apartment communities. During 2012, we also purchased our joint venture partner's interest in one operating community, obtaining a 100% ownership interest in that apartment community. In addition, we sold

one

wholly-owned community in


through the date this Form 10-K was filed.

In March 2005, we formed AvalonBay Value Added Fund, L.P. ("Fund I"), a private, discretionary real estate investment vehicle, which we manage and in which we own a

15.2%

interest. Fund I acquired communities with the objective of either redeveloping or repositioning them, or taking advantage of market cycle timing and improved operating performance. From its inception in March 2005 through the close of its investment period in 2008, Fund I acquired


communities. During the

three years ended December 31, 2014

, we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of the last of the


communities owned by Fund I. During


, Fund I disposed of its final four communities. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015.

In September 2008, we formed AvalonBay Value Added Fund II, L.P. ("Fund II"), a second institutional discretionary real estate investment fund which we manage and in which we own a

31.3%

interest. In 2012, Fund II acquired its final operating community. From the commencement of Fund II through the close of its investment period, Fund II acquired


operating communities. During the

three years ended December 31, 2014

, we realized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of

three

communities owned by Fund II.

In conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, excluding the Residual JV, we acquired interests in

three

additional joint ventures, Archstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the "U.S. Fund"), Archstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the "AC JV") and Brandywine Apartments of Maryland, LLC ("Brandywine").

The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund owns

nine

communities containing

1,730

apartment homes, one of which includes a marina containing


boat slips. Through subsidiaries, we acquired and own the general partner of the fund and hold a

28.6%

interest in the fund.

The AC JV is a joint venture in which we acquired Archstone's

20.0%

ownership interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011 and owns

three

operating apartment communities containing


apartment homes, one of which completed development in


. The AC JV partnership agreement contains provisions that require us to provide a right of first offer ("ROFO") to the AC JV in connection with additional opportunities to acquire or develop additional interests in multifamily real estate assets within a specified geographic radius of the existing assets, generally one mile or less. The ROFO restriction expires in 2019.



Brandywine owns a


apartment home community located in Washington, DC, which is managed by a third party. Brandywine is comprised of

five

members who hold various interests in the joint venture. In conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, we acquired a 26.1% equity interest in the venture, and subsequently purchased an additional 2.6% interest, and as of

December 31, 2014

, hold a

28.7%

equity interest in the venture.

A more detailed description of Fund I, Fund II, the U.S. Fund and the AC JV (collectively, the "Funds"), Brandywine and the related investment activity can be found in the discussion in Note 6, "Investments in Real Estate Entities," of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report and in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Through subsidiaries, the Company and Equity Residential entered into three limited liability company agreements (collectively, the “Residual JV”) through which the Company and Equity Residential acquired (i) certain assets of Archstone that the Company and Equity Residential plan to divest (to third parties or to the Company or Equity Residential) over time (the “Residual Assets”), and (ii) various liabilities of Archstone that the Company and Equity Residential agreed to assume in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition (the “Residual Liabilities”).  The Residual Assets currently include a

20.0%

interest in Lake Mendota Investments, LLC and Subsidiaries ("SWIB"), a joint venture which currently owns and manages

four

apartment communities with

1,410

apartment homes in the United States;

two

land parcels; and various licenses, insurance policies, contracts, office leases and other miscellaneous assets. The Residual Liabilities include most existing or future litigation and claims related to Archstone’s operations for periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, except for (i) claims that principally relate to the physical condition of the assets acquired directly by the Company or Equity Residential, which generally remain the sole responsibility of the Company or Equity Residential, as applicable, and (ii) certain tax and other litigation between Archstone and various equity holders in Archstone related to periods before the close of the Archstone Acquisition, and claims which may arise due to changes in the capital structure of Archstone that occurred prior to closing, for which Lehman has agreed to indemnify the Company and Equity Residential. The Company and Equity Residential jointly control the Residual JV and the Company holds a

40.0%

economic interest in the assets and liabilities of the Residual JV.

Including sales by unconsolidated entities and entities in which we held a residual profits interest, and excluding the sale of indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, during


we sold


operating communities and recognized a gain in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") of $

181,557,000

. We also recognized income of

$60,534,000

representing our promoted interests in certain of the unconsolidated ventures disposed of in 2014.

A further discussion of our development, redevelopment, disposition, acquisition, property management and related strategies follows.

Development Strategy.

We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. As one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets, we identify development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information achieved through our regional offices. In addition to our principal executive office in Arlington, Virginia, we also maintain regional offices, administrative offices or specialty offices, including offices that are in or near the following cities:

•

Boston, Massachusetts;

•

Long Island, New York;

•

Los Angeles, California;

•

New York, New York;

•

Newport Beach, California;

•

San Francisco, California;

•

San Jose, California;

•

Seattle, Washington;

•

Fairfield, Connecticut;

•

Virginia Beach, Virginia; and

•

Woodbridge, New Jersey.



After selecting a target site, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options and long-term conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire the target site shortly before the start of construction, which reduces development-related risks and preserves capital. However, as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development, we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained, or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning. For further discussion of our Development Rights, refer to Item 2. "Communities" in this report.

We generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager, except for certain mid-rise and high-rise apartment communities, where we may elect to use third-party general contractors as construction managers. We generally perform these functions directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary) both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. Our development, property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase.

During periods where competition for development land is more intense, we may acquire improved land with existing commercial uses and rezone the site for multifamily residential use. During the period that we hold these buildings for future development, any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations, which we consider to be incidental, is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income. Any expenses relating to these operations, in excess of any rents received, are accounted for as a reduction in net income. We have also participated, and may in the future participate, in master planned or other large multi-use developments where we commit to build infrastructure (such as roads) to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties (such as unimproved ground floor retail space, municipal garages or parks). Costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services. Particularly with large scale, urban in-fill developments, we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction.

Throughout this report, the term "development" is used to refer to the entire property development cycle, including pursuit of zoning approvals, procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process. References to "construction" refer to the actual construction of the property, which is only one element of the development cycle.

Redevelopment Strategy.

When we undertake the redevelopment of a community, our goal is to renovate and/or rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital. We have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment. Our redevelopment teams, which include redevelopment, construction and property management personnel, monitor redevelopment progress. We believe we achieve significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor. More importantly, this helps to ensure quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the lease-up and restabilization phases.

Throughout this report, the term "redevelopment" is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle, including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs, budgeting and actual renovation work. The actual renovation work is referred to as "reconstruction," which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle.

Disposition Strategy.

We sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when market conditions are favorable, and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions. This also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity. We are then able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal.

As part of the Archstone Acquisition, we acquired 14 assets that were contributed by third parties on a tax-deferred basis to an Archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests.  To protect the tax-deferred nature of the contribution, the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling, or repaying secured financing on, the contributed assets.  As of

December 31, 2014

, the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would be triggered by the sale of all 14 contributed assets is estimated to be approximately

$44,000,000

.

Acquisition Strategy.

Our core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target. Acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence. Acquisitions (and dispositions) also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio. Portfolio growth also allows for fixed general and administrative costs to be a smaller percentage of overall community Net Operating Income ("NOI").



We are not presently pursuing the formation of a new discretionary real estate investment fund, preferring at this time to maintain flexibility in shaping our portfolio of wholly-owned assets through acquisitions and dispositions.

Property Management Strategy.

We seek to increase operating income through innovative, proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses. Our principal strategies to maximize revenue include:

•

focusing on resident satisfaction;

•

staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns;

•

balancing high occupancy with premium pricing and increasing rents as market conditions permit; and

•

employing revenue management software to optimize the pricing and term of leases.

Constraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth. Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue, thereby increasing operating margins. We constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways, which include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

we use purchase order controls, acquiring goods and services from pre-approved vendors;

•

we use national negotiated contracts and also purchase supplies in bulk where possible;

•

we bid third-party contracts on a volume basis;

•

we strive to retain residents through high levels of service in order to eliminate the cost of preparing an apartment home for a new resident and to reduce marketing and vacant apartment utility costs;

•

we perform turnover work in-house or hire third parties, generally considering the most cost effective approach as well as expertise needed to perform the work;

•

we undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize resident safety and satisfaction, as well as to maximize property and equipment life; and

•

we aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals.

On-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the NOI produced at their respective communities. We use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities, believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions, maintenance decisions and financial management.

We generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary) both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. From time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing and/or maintenance activity at one or more of our communities.

From time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction. As a REIT, we generally cannot provide direct services to our residents that are not customarily provided by a landlord, nor can we directly share in the income of a third party that provides such services. However, we can provide such non-customary services to residents or share in the revenue from such services if we do so through a "taxable REIT subsidiary," which is a subsidiary that is treated as a "C corporation" subject to federal income taxes. See "Tax Matters" below.

Financing Strategy.

We maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks. We estimate that our short-term liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand, borrowings under our

$1,300,000,000

revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), sales of current operating communities and/or issuance of additional debt or equity securities. A determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions, our short and long-term liquidity needs, the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities. A summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.



We have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projection, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.

In addition, from time to time, we may offer shares of our equity securities, debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property. We may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own.

Other Strategies and Activities.

While we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities, we have the ability to invest in other types of real estate, mortgages (including participating or convertible mortgages), securities of other REITs or real estate operating companies, or securities of technology companies that relate to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or our residents, in each case consistent with our qualification as a REIT. In addition, we own and lease retail space at our communities when either (i) the highest and best use of the space is for retail (e.g., street level in an urban area); (ii) we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or; (iii) some component of retail space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes. As of

December 31, 2014

, we had a total of

625,798

square feet of rentable retail space, excluding retail space within communities currently under construction. Gross rental revenue provided by leased retail space in


was

$17,894,000

(

1.1%

of total revenue). We may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the retail component of a mixed-use building that we help develop. If we secure a development right and believe that its best use, in whole or in part, is to develop the real estate with the intent to sell rather than hold the asset, we may, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, develop real estate for sale. Any investment in securities of other entities, and any development of real estate for sale, is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations, gross income tests, and other limitations that must be observed for REIT qualification.

We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so. At all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT unless, because of circumstances or changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code (or the Treasury Regulations thereunder), our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT.

Tax Matters

We filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with limited exceptions, such as those described under "Property Management Strategy" above, we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level. While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

Competition

We face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies and other REITs, to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development. As an owner and operator of apartment communities, we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Although we often compete against large, sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents, real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents.



Environmental and Related Matters

As a current or prior owner, operator and developer of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities. For some development communities we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction, which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost. Environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in Item 1A. "Risk Factors."

We believe that more government regulation of energy use, along with a greater focus on environmental protection, may, over time, have a significant impact on urban growth patterns. If changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur, such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in high-density development. However, there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or, if they do occur, whether the multifamily industry or the Company will benefit from such changes.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1978. In 1995, we reincorporated in the State of Maryland and have been focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time. As of

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences, including those described below. This Item 1A. includes forward-looking statements. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Development, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability.

We intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities. These activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in high-density urban areas. These activities may be exposed to the following risks:

•

we may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy, or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;

•

we may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor or other costs;

•

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, resulting in increased construction and financing costs and a decrease in expected rental revenues;

•

we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms, or at all, for the proposed development of a community, which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity;

•

we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process, for example, in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition (such as commercial space) or in connection with providing services to third parties (such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements); and

•

we may incur liability if our communities are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Acts, the Fair Housing Act or other federal, state or local requirements. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines, an award of damages to private litigants, and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance.

We estimate construction costs based on market conditions at the time we prepare our budgets, and our projections include changes that we anticipate but cannot predict with certainty. Construction costs may increase, particularly for labor and certain materials and, for some of our Development Communities and Development Rights (as defined below), the total construction costs may be higher than the original budget. Total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred and projected to be incurred to develop or redevelop a community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including:

•

land and/or property acquisition costs;

•

fees paid to secure air rights and/or tax abatements;

•

construction or reconstruction costs;

•

costs of environmental remediation;

•

real estate taxes;

•

capitalized interest and insurance;

•

loan fees;

•

permits;

•

professional fees;



•

allocated development or redevelopment overhead; and

•

other regulatory fees.

Costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases, exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be experienced in the future. We cannot assure you that market rents in effect at the time new development or redevelopment communities complete lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased construction or reconstruction costs.

Unfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, and the overall market value of our assets, including joint ventures and investments in the Funds.

Local conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy, rental rates and the operating performance of our communities. The risks that may adversely affect conditions in those markets include the following:

•

plant closings, industry slowdowns and other factors that adversely affect the local economy;

•

an oversupply of, or a reduced demand for, apartment homes;

•

a decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth;

•

the inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases;

•

rent control or rent stabilization laws, or other laws regulating housing, that could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs; and

•

economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses, such as increases in property taxes, utilities, compensation of on-site associates and routine maintenance.

Changes in applicable laws, or noncompliance with applicable laws, could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability.

We must develop, construct and operate our communities in compliance with numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations may include zoning laws, building codes, landlord tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations. Noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability.

Lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in (i) laws imposing remediation requirements and the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions, (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlord/tenant laws, or (iii) other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development, use and operation of our communities, including changes to building codes and fire and life-safety codes.

Short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. Because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.

Competition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents.

Our apartment communities compete with other housing alternatives to attract residents, including other rental apartments, condominiums and single-family homes that are available for rent, as well as new and existing condominiums and single-family homes for sale. Competitive residential housing in a particular area could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.

Attractive investment opportunities may not be available, which could adversely affect our profitability.

We expect that other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension funds, other REITs and other well-capitalized investors, will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability.



Capital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital and/or the cost of capital, which could impact our business activities, dividends, earnings, and common stock price, among other things.

In periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility, the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected. We primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures. If sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms, we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity and/or take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt, such as selling assets, reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100% of our taxable income. To the extent that we are able and/or choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing) our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and/or decline in a high interest rate or volatile economic environment. We believe that the lenders under our Credit Facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder, but if economic conditions deteriorate, there can be no assurance that the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations would not be adversely impacted.

Insufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk.

We are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. In this regard, we note that in order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain. This requirement limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments. The principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity. Although we may be able to repay our debt by using our cash flows, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments. Therefore, we may need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms; either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Rising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock.

We currently have, and may in the future incur, contractual variable interest rate debt. In addition, we regularly seek access to both fixed and variable rate debt financing to repay maturing debt and to finance our development and redevelopment activity. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, our interest costs will also rise, unless we have made arrangements that hedge the risk of rising interest rates. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Bond financing and zoning compliance requirements could limit our income, restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable.

We have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes and, therefore, the interest rate is generally more favorable to us. These obligations are commonly referred to as "tax-exempt bonds" and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities. As a condition to obtaining tax-exempt financing, or on occasion as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning in some jurisdictions, we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds (e.g., 50% or 80% of area median income), or who meet other qualifying tests. As of

December 31, 2014

, approximately

6.0%

of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these. These commitments, which may run without expiration or may expire after a period of time (such as 15 or 20 years) may limit our ability to raise rents and, in consequence, can also adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions.

In addition, some of our tax-exempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal of, and interest on, the bonds. The guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit, surety bond, guarantee agreement or other additional collateral. If the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations, or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral, a default will occur under the applicable tax-exempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds.

Risks related to indebtedness.

We have a Credit Facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred. Accordingly, subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants, we could incur more debt, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.



The mortgages on those of our properties that are subject to secured debt, our Credit Facility and the indenture under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. Maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility. A default in these requirements, if uncured, could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness, which could severely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs. Refer to Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion.

The mortgages on those of our properties subject to secured debt generally include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty or payment that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to repay the mortgage note prior to the earlier of (i) the stated maturity of the note, or (ii) the date at which the mortgage note is prepayable without such penalty or payment. If we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance for our mortgage notes, we may incur prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets.

There are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt. Their ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, amount of real estate under development, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings, among other factors. If market conditions change, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets.

Debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to our stockholders.

Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of debt and equity financing. Debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on favorable terms. If we issue additional equity securities, the interests of existing stockholders could be diluted.

Failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders.

A decrease in rental revenue, or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our development activities, could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. Significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments, if any, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community.

The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations.

The form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. The Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.

We may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive.

We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock, as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends.



Difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility.

Federal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community (unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale) if we are found to have held, acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community, and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders. In addition, real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable. These potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions.

Acquisitions may not yield anticipated results.

Our business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities. Our acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks:

•

an acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment; and

•

our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate.

Failure to succeed in new markets, or with new brands and community formats, or in activities other than the development, ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences.

We may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience in our existing markets in developing, owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets, should we choose to enter them. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions; an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities; an inability to hire and retain key personnel; and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.

Although we are primarily in the multifamily business, we also own and lease ancillary retail space when a retail component represents the best use of the space, as is often the case with large urban in-fill developments. We also may engage or have an interest in for-sale activity. We may be unsuccessful in owning and leasing retail space at our communities or in developing real estate with the intent to sell, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are currently implementing two new brands of communities that target various customer preferences. We cannot assure that these brands will be successful or that our costs in developing and implementing these brands will result in incremental revenue and earnings.

Land we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges.

We own parcels of land that we do not currently intend to develop. As discussed in Item 2. "Communities—Other Land and Real Estate Assets" in the event that the fair market value of a parcel changes such that we determine that the carrying basis of the parcel reflected in our financial statements is greater than the parcel's then current fair value, less costs to dispose, we would be subject to an impairment charge, which would reduce our net income.

We are exposed to various risks from our real estate activity through joint ventures.

Instead of acquiring or developing apartment communities directly, at times we invest as a partner or a co-venturer. Joint venture investments (including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies) involve risks, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due; that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses; that our partner might at any time have business goals that are inconsistent with ours; and that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests. Frequently, we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell arrangement, that could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partner's interest, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction.

We are exposed to risks associated with investment in and management of discretionary real estate investment funds

.

We formed Fund I and Fund II, in which we have an equity interest of

15.2%

and

31.3%

, and as part of the Archstone Acquisition we acquired equity interests in the U.S. Fund and the AC JV of

28.6%

and

20.0%

, respectively, which, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we manage as the general partner and managing member and in which at

December 31, 2014

we have an aggregate equity investment, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of each respective fund, of approximately

$250,024,000

, net of distributions to us. The investment periods for Fund I, Fund II and the U.S. Fund are over, and Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015. The Funds present risks, including the following:



•

our subsidiaries that are the general partners of the Funds are generally liable, under partnership law, for the debts and obligations of the respective Funds, subject to certain exculpation and indemnification rights pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement of the Funds;

•

investors in the Funds holding a majority of the partnership interests may remove us as the general partner without cause, in the case of Fund I and Fund II, subject to our right to receive compensation for an additional period of management fees after such removal and our right to acquire one of the properties then held by such Funds;

•

while we have broad discretion to manage the Funds, the investors or an advisory committee comprised of representatives of the investors must approve certain matters, and as a result we may be unable to cause the Funds to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial; and

•

we may be liable and/or our status as a REIT may be jeopardized if either the Funds, or the REIT entities associated with the Funds and/or the U.S. Fund and/or AC JV, fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters.

The governance provisions of our joint ventures with Equity Residential could adversely affect our flexibility in dealing with such joint venture assets and liabilities

.

In connection with the Archstone Acquisition, we created joint ventures with Equity Residential that manage certain of the acquired assets and liabilities. These structures involve participation in the ventures by Equity Residential whose interests and rights may not be the same as ours. Joint ownership of an investment in real estate involves risks not associated with direct ownership of real estate, including the risk that Equity Residential may at any time have economic or other business interests or goals which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals, including inconsistent goals relating to the sale of properties held in the joint ventures or the timing of the termination and liquidation of the joint ventures. Under the form for the joint venture arrangements, neither we nor Equity Residential expect to individually have the sole power to control the ventures, and an impasse could occur, which could adversely affect the applicable joint venture and decrease potential returns to us and our investors.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any breach, interruption or security failure of that technology could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks.

We collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities, and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment. In addition, we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us.

We address potential breaches or disclosure of this confidential personally identifiable information by implementing a variety of security measures intended to protect the confidentiality and security of this information including (among others) engaging reputable, recognized firms to help us design and maintain our information technology and data security systems, including testing and verification of their proper and secure operations on a periodic basis. We also maintain cyber risk insurance to cover certain risks arising out of data and network breaches.

However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information. Any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects, including (among others) disruption of our business and operations, disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information of our residents and/or associates), damage to our reputation, and/or potentially significant legal and/or financial liabilities and penalties.

We are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable, not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage, including risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes and severe weather.

Earthquake risk.

As further described in Item 2. "Communities—Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses" many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels. In the event of a loss in excess of insured limits, we could lose our capital invested in the affected community, as well as anticipated future revenue from that community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.



Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical.

Severe or inclement weather risk.

Particularly in New England and the Metro New York/New Jersey area, we are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather, including hurricanes, severe winter storms and coastal flooding.  Severe or inclement weather may result in increased costs, such as losses and costs resulting from repair of water and wind damage, removal of snow and ice, and, in the case of our development communities, delays in construction that result in increased construction costs and delays in realizing rental revenues from a community.  In addition, severe or inclement weather could increase the need for maintenance of our communities.

Where we have a geographic concentration of exposures, a single catastrophe that affects a region, such as an earthquake that affects the West Coast or a hurricane or severe winter storm that affects the Mid-Atlantic, Metro New York/New Jersey or New England regions, may have a significant negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Terrorism risk.

We have significant investments in large metropolitan markets, such as the Metro New York/New Jersey and Washington, D.C. markets, that have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks.  Future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities, both physically and financially, or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant uninsured property or liability loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to the earthquake insurance discussed above, we carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management's view, economically impractical. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, we could lose our capital invested in a community, as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. If an uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with, or court ordered damages to, that third party. A significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.

We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance.

Under various federal, state and local environmental and public health laws, regulations and ordinances, we may be required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties (including in some cases natural substances such as methane and radon gas) and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate the contamination, may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, develop, sell or rent the affected property. In addition, some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.

The development, construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances, which regulate matters including wetlands protection, storm water runoff and wastewater discharge. These laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities may be developed, and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of noncompliance with these laws.

Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials ("ACMs") when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building. These laws and the common law may impose liability for release of ACMs and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. We are not aware that any ACMs were used in the construction of the communities we developed. ACMs were, however, used in the construction of a number of the communities that we acquired. We implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which ACMs are detected. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of ACMs at our communities.



We are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities. We do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the presence of lead paint at our communities.

Environmental agencies and third parties may assert claims for remediation or personal injury based on the alleged actual or potential intrusion into buildings of chemical vapors from soils or groundwater underlying or in the vicinity of those buildings or on nearby properties. We currently do not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of vapor intrusion at our communities.

All of our stabilized operating communities, and all of the communities that we are currently developing, have been subjected to at least a Phase I or similar environmental assessment, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling. These assessments, together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties, have not revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition or results of operations. In connection with our ownership, operation and development of communities, from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants, including contaminants in soil, groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings. In some cases, an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates. There can be no assurance, however, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that environmental liability arises.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us when they see mold or excessive moisture. We have established procedures for promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the resident believe a health risk is presented. However, we cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage.

Additionally, we have occasionally been involved in developing, managing, leasing and operating various properties for third parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties. We are not aware of any material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties.

We cannot assure you that:

•

the environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities;

•

no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments;

•

no environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared;

•

the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, will not affect the environmental condition of our communities;

•

future uses or conditions, including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, will not result in the imposition of environmental liability; and

•

no environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability.

Our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. Our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our Board of Directors from among the opportunities identified by our regional offices. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry, and the loss of several of our key personnel could adversely affect the Company.



Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax). In addition, unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we lose our qualification. The additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Thus, our failure to qualify as a REIT could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and would adversely affect the value of our common stock.

We believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT, and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a REIT, or that we will remain qualified in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. In addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification.

Even if we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our shareholders. In addition, we may through our taxable REIT subsidiaries hold certain assets and engage in certain activities that a REIT could not engage in directly. We also use taxable REIT subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100% prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable REIT subsidiary. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to U.S. tax as regular corporations. The Archstone Acquisition increased the amount of assets held through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.

The ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by Maryland law.

There are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us, even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests. These provisions include the following:

Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to

50,000,000

shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights, including voting rights, of any series of preferred stock issued. The Board of Directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could allow the Board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control.

To maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year. To maintain this qualification, and/or to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock, our charter generally prohibits ownership (directly, indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, or beneficially as defined in Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act) by any single stockholder of more than 9.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. In general, under our charter, pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock. Under our charter, our Board of Directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons, but is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a REIT. These ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, could adversely affect our stockholders' ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock.

As a Maryland corporation, we are subject to the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Maryland law imposes restrictions on some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur, which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers, even if they are in our stockholders' best interests. In addition, other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit the Board of Directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval (such as classifying our Board such that the entire Board is not up for re-election annually) that, if made or taken, could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control.



ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.

ITEM 2.    COMMUNITIES

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, communities in various stages of development ("Development Communities") and Development Rights (as defined below). Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities, and exclude communities owned by the Residual JV. While we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis, we intend to update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change during the year.

The following is a description of each category:

Current Communities

are categorized as Established, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up or Redevelopment according to the following attributes:

•

Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities)

are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year period to the current year period is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year period. The Company generally establishes the classification of communities as of the beginning of the calendar year; however, in 2014, effective April 1, 2014, the Company updated its classification of communities primarily to include communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in the results of operations of our Established Community portfolio for the balance of the year.  The Established Communities for the year ended

December 31, 2014

are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2013, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year period. Any discussion of results of operations for the Established Communities for the year ended

December 31, 2014

excludes communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The Established Communities as of

December 31, 2014

, as updated effective April 1, 2014, are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of April 1, 2013, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year period.  Established Communities as of

December 31, 2014

include most of the stabilized operating communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.  A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of

95%

physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all other completed communities that we own or have a direct or indirect ownership interest in, and that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year.  Other Stabilized Communities for the year ended

December 31, 2014

include the stabilized operating communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

•

Lease-Up Communities

are communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and where physical occupancy has not reached

95%

.

•

Redevelopment Communities

are communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of

$5,000,000

or

10%

of the community's pre-redevelopment basis and is expected to have a material impact on the operations of the community, including occupancy levels and future rental rates.

Development Communities

are communities that are under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received. These communities may be partially complete and operating.

Development Rights

are development opportunities in the early phase of the development process for which we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land, where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community, or where we are the designated developer in a public-private partnership. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.

We currently lease our corporate headquarters located in Arlington, Virginia, as well as our other regional and administrative offices under operating leases.



As of

December 31, 2014

, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in, excluding indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, were classified as follows:

____________________________

(1)

Reflects the community classification effective April 1, 2014, which includes most stabilized communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in our Established Communities portfolio.

(2)

Metro NY/NJ Established Communities includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater in January 2015.

Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.

We generally establish the composition of our Established Communities portfolio annually. Determined as of January 1 of each of the respective years, the Established Communities portfolio for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, had


,


and


communities added, respectively, and

six

,

seven

and


communities removed, respectively. The Company removes a community from its Established Communities portfolio for the upcoming year (and then generally maintains that designation) if the Company believes that planned activity for a community for the upcoming year will result in that community's expected operations not being comparable to the prior year period.  The Company believes that a community's expected operations will not be comparable to the prior year period when it intends either (i) to undertake a significant capital renovation of the community, such that the Company would consider the community to be classified as a Redevelopment Community; or (ii) to dispose of a community through a sale or other disposition transaction.  For the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, the Company removed

four

,

five

and


communities, respectively, from its Established Communities portfolio due to a reclassification to the Redevelopment Community portfolio on account of then current or expected redevelopment, and removed

two

,

two

and

seven

communities, respectively, from its Established Communities portfolio due to the planned disposition of the communities.



Effective April 1, 2014, the Company updated its operating segments primarily to include communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in the results of operations of our Established Community portfolio for the balance of the year. The Established Communities portfolio as of

December 31, 2014

added 43 stabilized communities to the Established Communities portfolio, primarily those acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition, and removed one community from our Established Communities portfolio effective January 1, 2014, due to a reclassification to the Redevelopment Community portfolio.

Current Communities

Our Current Communities include garden-style apartment communities consisting of multi-story buildings in landscaped settings, as well as mid and high rise apartment communities in urban settings. As of

January 31, 2015

, our Current Communities consisted of


garden-style (of which


are mixed communities and/or include town homes),


high-rise and


mid-rise apartment communities.

Our communities generally offer a variety of quality amenities and features, which may include:

•

fully-equipped kitchens;

•

lofts and vaulted ceilings;

•

walk-in closets;

•

fireplaces;

•

patios/decks; and

•

modern appliances.

Other features at various communities may include:

•

swimming pools;

•

fitness centers;

•

tennis courts; and

•

wi-fi lounges.

As described in Item 1. "Business," we operate under three core brands

Avalon, AVA

and

Eaves by Avalon.

Our core

"Avalon"

brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services.

"AVA"

targets customers in high energy, transit-served urban neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living with an emphasis on modern design and a technology focus.

"Eaves by Avalon"

is targeted to the cost conscious, "value" segment in suburban areas. We believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by targeting our market by consumer preference and attitude as well as by location and price.

We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service-oriented property management team, focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to discriminating residents. We believe our mission of

Enhancing the Lives of our Residents

helps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.

Our Current Communities, excluding indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, are located in the following geographic markets:



____________________________

(1)

New Jersey Current Communities includes 240 apartment homes which were destroyed and are uninhabitable as a result of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater in January 2015.

We manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we completed construction of

4,121

apartment homes in


communities and sold

3,234

apartment homes in


communities. The average age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is

19.5

years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the weighted average age of our Current Communities is

13.1

years.

Of the Current Communities, as of

January 31, 2015

, we owned (directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries):

•

a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in


operating communities,


of which are on land subject to land leases expiring in October 2026, November 2028, May 2041, July 2046, December 2061, September 2065, November 2067, April 2095, May 2105, September 2105, April 2106 and March 2142;

•

a general partnership interest and an indirect limited partnership interest in Fund I, Fund II, the U.S. Fund and the AC JV. Subsidiaries of Fund II own a fee simple interest in


operating communities, subsidiaries of the U.S. Fund own a fee simple interest in

nine

operating communities, and subsidiaries of the AC JV own a fee simple interest in

three

operating communities;

•

a general partnership interest in

one

partnership structured as a "DownREIT," as described more fully below, that owns

one

community; and

•

a membership interest in

four

limited liability companies, that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community.



For some communities, a land lease is used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration. We have options to purchase the underlying land for certain of the land leases for which we have an absolute ownership interest that expire in October 2026, November 2028 and April 2095.

We also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, the full fee simple ownership interest in 24 of the


Development Communities and a leasehold interest in

two

of the Development Communities with the land leases expiring in December 2086 and November 2106. The land lease expiring in 2086 provides an option for the Company to purchase the land at some point during the lease term.

In our partnership structured as a DownREIT, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of limited partnership interest. Limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. Under the partnership agreement for the DownREIT, the distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount. The holders of units of limited partnership interest have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount as determined by the partnership agreement and based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of

January 31, 2015

, there were 7,500 DownREIT partnership units outstanding. The DownREIT partnership is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had


Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of

8,524

apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately

$3,011,000,000

. In addition, the land for

two

Development Communities that we control under long-term land lease agreements is subject to future minimum rental amounts of approximately

$7,704,000

in


in the aggregate. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually, or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (including the factors identified under "Forward-Looking Statements") for further discussion of development activity.

The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities, unless otherwise noted in the table.



_________________________________

(1)

Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.  Projected total capitalized cost for communities identified as having joint venture ownership, either during construction or upon construction completion, represents the total projected joint venture contribution amount.

(2)

Future initial occupancy dates are estimates.  There can be no assurance that we will pursue to completion any or all of these proposed developments.



(3)

Stabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of

95%

or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the

one

-year anniversary of completion of development.

(4)

Development community subject to a ground lease.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company completed the development of the following communities:

____________________________________

(1)

Total capitalized cost is as of

December 31, 2014

.  The Company generally anticipates incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments.

(2)

The Company has a

20.0%

ownership interest in this community through the AC JV.



Redevelopment Communities

As of

December 31, 2014

, there were

eight

communities under redevelopment. We expect the total capitalized cost to redevelop these communities to be

$131,700,000

, excluding costs incurred prior to redevelopment. We have found that the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for reconstruction completion or for attaining restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. We anticipate maintaining or increasing our current level of redevelopment activity related to communities in our current operating portfolio. You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a discussion of the risks associated with redevelopment activity.

The following presents a summary of these Redevelopment Communities:

____________________________________

(1)

Projected total capitalized cost does not include capitalized costs incurred prior to redevelopment.

(2)

Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of redevelopment.

Development Rights

At

December 31, 2014

, we had

$180,516,000

in acquisition and related capitalized costs for land parcels we own, and

$67,029,000

in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through an option to purchase or lease the land. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to


Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The cumulative capitalized costs for land held for development as of

December 31, 2014

includes

$144,099,000

in original land acquisition costs. The original land acquisition cost per home ranged from

$24,000

per home in

Connecticut

to

$74,000

per home in

New York

. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately

10,384

apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.

For


Development Rights, we control the land through an option to purchase or lease the parcel. While we generally prefer to hold Development Rights through options to acquire land, for the


remaining Development Rights we either currently own the land or have executed a long term land lease for the parcel of land on which a community would be built if we proceeded with development.



The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights, for which future development is not yet considered probable, are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During


, we incurred a charge of approximately

$3,964,000

for development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined would not likely be developed.

You should carefully review Item 1A. "Risk Factors," for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.

The following presents a summary of these Development Rights:

____________________________________

(1)

Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.

Land Acquisitions

We select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During


we acquired land parcels for


Development Rights, as shown in the table below, for an aggregate investment of approximately

$139,685,000

.



____________________________________

(1)

Projected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land and related acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees.

(2)

Land was acquired through a joint venture in which the Company owns a 70.0% interest.

(3)

In 2014, we acquired this additional parcel of land for the development of Avalon Glendora, expected to have a total of 280 apartment homes for a projected total capitalized cost of $82.5 million.

In January 2015, we acquired land for

$325,000,000

associated with

three

Development Rights located in New York, NY and Bellevue, WA. If developed as expected, the development rights related to this land will contain


apartment homes for a projected total capital cost of

$509,717,000

.

Other Land and Real Estate Assets

We own land parcels with a carrying value of approximately

$20,941,000

, which we do not currently plan to develop. These parcels consist of (i) land that we originally planned to develop and (ii) ancillary parcels acquired in connection with Development Rights that we had not planned to develop. We believe that the current carrying value for all of these land parcels is such that there is no indication of impaired value, or further need to record a charge for impairment in the case of assets previously impaired. However, we may be subject to the recognition of further charges for impairment in the event that there are indicators of such impairment and we determine that the carrying value of the assets is greater than the current fair value, less costs to dispose.

Disposition Activity

We (i) sell assets when they do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into development or redevelopment activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax deferred, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2014 to

January 31, 2015

, we sold our interest in

five

wholly-owned communities, containing

1,660

apartment homes. The aggregate gross sales price for these assets was

$411,700,000

.



Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses

We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities.  These policies, and other insurance policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured and self-insured limits and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable.  There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical.  You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or liability loss.

Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault and the Hayward Fault.  We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured levels.  We have in place with respect to communities located in California and Washington, for any single occurrence and in the aggregate, $150,000,000 of coverage. Earthquake coverage outside of California and Washington is subject to a $175,000,000 limit for each occurrence and in the aggregate. In California the deductible for each occurrence is five percent of the insured value of each damaged building with a maximum of $25,000,000 per loss. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible per occurrence except that the next $350,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an additional self-insured retention until the total incurred self-insured retention exceeds $1,500,000.  We self-insure a portion of our primary property insurance which includes the earthquake risks.

Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, there have been reports that apartment communities could become targets of terrorism.  In December 2007, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available through a federal back-stop program. Congress reauthorized TRIPRA in January 2015 for six years. We have also purchased insurance for property damage due to terrorism up to $400,000,000 including insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIPRA, such as domestic-based terrorism.  This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions.  Our general liability policy provides terrorism coverage through TRIPRA (subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts at our communities.

An additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth.  Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time.  If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities.  For further discussion of the risks and the Company’s related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance” elsewhere in this report.  We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.

We also carry crime policies (also commonly referred to as a fidelity policy or employee dishonesty policy) that protect the Company, up to $30,000,000 per occurrence, from employee theft of money, securities or property.  This amount may not be sufficient to cover losses that may be in excess of the policy limits.

Edgewater Casualty Loss

In January 2015 a fire occurred at our Avalon at Edgewater apartment community located in Edgewater, New Jersey ("Edgewater"). Edgewater consisted of two residential buildings. One building, which contained 240 apartment homes, was destroyed and is uninhabitable. The second building, which contains 168 apartment homes, has been reoccupied and we currently believe it only suffered minimal damage. We are currently assessing our direct losses resulting from the fire, which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild, as well as our liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire. To date, a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against us, including three purported class actions. While we currently believe that our direct losses and liability to third parties will be substantially covered by our insurance policies, including coverage for the replacement cost of the building, third party claims, and business interruption loss, subject to deductibles as well as a self-insured portion of the property insurance for which we are obligated for 12% of the first $50,000,000 in losses, we can give no assurances in this regard and continue to evaluate this matter.



As of December 31, 2014, Edgewater was encumbered with a fixed-rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of 5.95%, and an outstanding principal balance of $75,012,000, due in May 2019 (the “Edgewater Mortgage”). The Edgewater Mortgage stipulates that in the event of a casualty loss such as the Edgewater fire, the lender has absolute discretion to determine the disposition of the insurance proceeds, and can compel us (i) to direct the insurance proceeds to be used for the restoration of Edgewater, or (ii) to apply the insurance proceeds to repay the outstanding loan balance, at par.  As of the date of this Form 10-K, we are complying with all lender requirements, and are working with the lender to resolve open issues related to the Edgewater Mortgage.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

As discussed immediately above, in January 2015 a fire occurred at the Company's Avalon at Edgewater apartment community in Edgewater, NJ.  The Company is aware that third parties including residents suffered significant property damage and other losses, such as relocation costs, associated with the fire, but the Company is not aware of any persons who suffered major personal injury. To date, a number of lawsuits have been filed on behalf of Edgewater residents, including the following three purported class actions:

DeMarco and Bayer et al v. AvalonBay Communities Inc. et al

and

Gutierrez v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. et al

, each filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey; and

Loposky and Kemp et al v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. et al

filed in the Superior Court of New Jersey Bergen County - Law Division. While the Company currently believes that, subject to applicable deductibles, all of its liability to third parties resulting from the fire will be substantially covered by its insurance policies, the Company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter.

The Company is involved in various other claims and/or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. While no assurances can be given, the Company does not currently believe that any of these other outstanding litigation matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol AVB. The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock for the years


and


, as reported by the NYSE. On

January 30, 2015

there were


holders of record of an aggregate of

132,049,857

shares of our outstanding common stock. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency, but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.

At present, we expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends. However, the form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. The Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.

In January


, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a dividend on our common stock for the first quarter of


of

$1.25

per share, a

7.8%

increase over the previous quarterly dividend per share of

$1.16

. The dividend will be payable on April 15,


to all common stockholders of record as of March 31,

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The following table provides historical consolidated financial, operating and other data for the Company. You should read the table with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in this report (dollars in thousands, except per share information).

_________________________________

(1)

Amounts do not include unvested restricted shares included in the calculation of Earnings per Share. Please refer to Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation—Earnings per Common Share," of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of the calculation of Earnings per Share.



_________________________________

Notes to Selected Financial Data

(1)

Interest expense, net includes any loss or gain incurred from the extinguishment of debt.

(2)

EBITDA is defined as net income before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization from both continuing and discontinued operations. Under this definition, EBITDA includes gains on sale of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests. Management generally considers EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP), as an indicator of our operating performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA as calculated by other companies.

(3)

We generally consider Funds from Operations, or "FFO," as defined below, to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report.

Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts® ("NAREIT"), we calculate FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for:

•

gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities;

•

extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP);

•

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle;

•

impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets;



•

write-downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates;

•

depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

FFO does not represent net income in accordance with GAAP, and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income, which remains the primary measure, as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO.

FFO also does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A presentation of GAAP based cash flow metrics is provided in "Cash Flow Information" in the table on the previous page.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO (dollars in thousands, except per share data).

_________________________________

(1)

Amount for 2014 excludes a gain of $14,132, representing our joint venture partners' portion of the gain on sale from a Fund I community which we consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

(4)

Current Communities consist of all communities other than those which are still under construction and for which a certificate or certificates of occupancy for the entire community have not been received



ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help provide an understanding of our business, financial condition and results of operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under "Forward-Looking Statements" as well as the risk factors described in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" of this report.

Executive Overview

Business Description

We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California.   We believe that apartment communities are an attractive long-term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments, because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle, and shorter lease terms allow for a better ability to take advantage of inflationary environments.  We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe are characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, lower housing affordability and a diverse and vibrant quality of life.  We believe these market characteristics offer the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community investment relative to other markets. We seek to create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms; deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in our selected markets; operating apartment communities; and selling communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy or when pricing is attractive.

Our strategy is to be leaders in market research and capital allocation, delivering a range of multifamily offerings tailored to serve the needs of the most attractive customer segments in the best-performing submarkets of the United States. Our communities are predominately upscale and generally command among the highest rents in their markets. However, we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services.

Financial Highlights

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, net income attributable to common stockholders was

$683,567,000

, an increase of

$330,426,000

, or

93.6%

, over the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures, including the Company’s promoted interests, increased NOI from newly developed and acquired communities, losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014, a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the Archstone Acquisition, and a decrease in depreciation expense related to in-place leases acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

For the year ended

December 31, 2014

, Established Communities NOI increased by

$22,961,000

, or

3.5%

, over the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in rental revenue of

3.9%

, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of

4.9%

over


. For purposes of the discussion in the MD&A, our Established Communities include those communities which we owned and had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2013, and therefore does not include communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

During


, we raised approximately

$1,154,220,000

of gross capital through the issuance of common equity and unsecured notes, borrowing on the Term Loan and asset sales, exclusive of proceeds from the disposition of joint ventures. The funds raised from asset sales consist of the proceeds from the sale of

four

communities and

one

parcel of land for gross sales proceeds of

$304,250,000

. In addition, in January 2015 we sold one community, Avalon on Stamford Harbor, located in Stamford, CT, for

$115,500,000

. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.

We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. We increased development activity during


from the prior year in anticipation of continued favorable economic conditions and apartment fundamentals. During


, we completed the development of


communities for an aggregate total capitalized cost of

$1,134,300,000

. We also started the development of


communities, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of

$1,342,800,000

. In addition, during


we completed the redevelopment of

five

communities for a total investment of

$53,000,000

, excluding costs incurred prior to the redevelopment.



We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing) provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets and financial flexibility. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility and Term Loan; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity, including common equity issued pursuant to the Forward); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under

Liquidity and Capital Resources.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we acquired Avalon Mission Oaks, located in Camarillo, CA. Avalon Mission Oaks contains


apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of

$47,000,000

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we sold

four

communities, containing an aggregate of

1,337

apartment homes for an aggregate gross sales price of

$296,200,000

and an aggregate gain in accordance with GAAP of

$106,138,000

. During


, we also sold a land parcel in Huntington Station, NY for

$8,050,000

, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of

$490,000

.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, three of the Company's joint ventures, excluding the Residual JV, sold operating communities.

•

CVP I, LLC, the entity that owned Avalon Chrystie Place, located in New York, NY containing 361 apartment homes and approximately 71,000 square feet of retail space, sold the community for

$365,000,000

.  We own a 20.0% interest in the entity, and our share of the gain in accordance with GAAP for the disposition was

$50,478,000

.  In addition, we received

$58,128,000

for our promoted interest in CVP I, LLC.

•

Fund I sold its final

four

communities, containing an aggregate of


homes for an aggregate gross sales price of

$125,000,000

. Our share of the aggregate total gain in accordance with GAAP was

$3,317,000

.

•

Fund II sold

two

communities containing an aggregate of


apartment homes for an aggregate sales price of

$166,950,000

. Our share of the total gain in accordance with GAAP was

$21,624,000

.

In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, the respective ventures repaid

$224,178,000

of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. This resulted in charges for prepayment penalties and a write off of deferred financing costs, of which the Company’s portion was approximately

$2,339,000

, and was reported as a reduction of equity in income of unconsolidated real estate entities.

Edgewater Casualty Loss

As discussed under Item 2. "Communities — Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses — Edgewater Casualty Loss," in January 2015 a fire occurred at Edgewater. The Company is currently assessing its direct losses resulting from the fire, which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild, as well its liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire.

Communities Overview

As of

December 31, 2014

, excluding indirect interests associated with the Residual JV, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in


apartment communities containing

82,487

apartment homes in


states and the District of Columbia, of which


communities were under construction and

eight

communities were under reconstruction. Of these communities,


were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including


owned by subsidiaries of Fund II and

nine

owned by the U.S. Fund. In addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional


wholly-owned communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated

10,384

apartment homes.

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities, Development Communities and Development Rights. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities.

Established Communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows the performance of these communities to be compared between years. Other Stabilized Communities are generally all other consolidated operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses during the current year, but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 9, "Segment Reporting," of our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in "Results of Operations" as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development Communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.



Results of Operations

Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and reflected in changes in NOI of our Established Communities; NOI derived from acquisitions and development completions; the loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. A comparison of our operating results for


,


and

Percentage change is not meaningful.



Net income attributable to common stockholders

increased

$330,426,000

, or

93.6%

, to

$683,567,000

in


primarily due to an increase in income from unconsolidated real estate entities resulting from the gains on sales of communities in various ventures, including the Company’s promoted interests, increased NOI from newly developed and acquired communities, losses on an interest rate contract in the prior year not present in 2014, a decrease in expensed acquisition costs related to the Archstone Acquisition and a decrease in depreciation expense related to in-place leases acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. Net income attributable to common stockholders decreased

$70,728,000

, or

16.7%

, in


from


primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense and expensed transaction costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition, coupled with the recognition of losses on an interest rate contract. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in NOI from communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition and our existing and newly developed communities in 2013, as well as an increase in gain on sale of communities as compared to the prior year.

NOI

is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs.  NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets.  In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impacts to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, investments and investment management expenses, expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net interest expense, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, general and administrative expense, joint venture income (loss), depreciation expense, casualty loss, impairment loss on land holdings, gain on sale of real estate assets, income from discontinued operations and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations.

NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Reconciliations of NOI for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):

_________________________________

(1)

Includes amounts associated with assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations.



The NOI increases for both


and


, as compared to the prior year, consist of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):

The increase in our Established Communities' NOI in


is due to increased rental rates, partially offset by decreased economic occupancy and increased operating expenses. The increase in


is due to increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy, partially offset by increased operating expenses.

Rental and other income

increased in both


and


as compared to the prior years due to additional rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities, including those acquired in the Archstone Acquisition in 2013, and an increase in rental rates and economic occupancy, in 2013, at our Established Communities.

Overall Portfolio—The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to

61,686

apartment homes for


, as compared to

57,240

homes for


and

43,411

homes for


. The weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to

$2,254

for


as compared to

$2,171

in


and

$2,017

in


.

Established Communities—Rental revenue increased

$36,096,000

, or

3.9%

, to

$963,917,000

for 2014 from

$927,821,000

in the prior year. The increase is due to an increase in average rental rates of

4.0%

to

$2,273

per apartment home, partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of

0.1%

to

96.0%

. Rental revenue increased

$34,749,000

, or

4.3%

, for


, as compared to the prior year. Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents.

We experienced increases in rental revenue for all of our Established Communities regions, except the Mid-Atlantic, in


as compared to the prior year, as discussed in more detail below.

The Metro New York/New Jersey region, which accounted for approximately

33.0%

of the Established Community rental revenue for


, experienced an increase in rental revenue of

3.4%

for


as compared to


, as a result of an increase in average rental rates to

$2,680

per apartment home. Economic occupancy remained consistent at

96.4%

for


as compared to


. Apartment demand in the Metro New York/New Jersey region is being driven by job growth across a diverse group of industries including healthcare, professional business services, technology, retail, hospitality and education. We expect to see continued growth in the Metro New York/New Jersey region in 2015. New York City is beginning to see a larger pipeline of new apartment deliveries, but suburban markets surrounding the city are more insulated from this new competition.

The New England region accounted for approximately

18.6%

of the Established Community rental revenue for


and experienced a rental revenue increase of

2.5%

over the prior year. Average rental rates increased

2.9%

to

$2,189

per apartment home, and were partially offset by a

0.4%

decrease in economic occupancy to

95.3%

for


as compared to


. Accelerating employment growth in the medical, education and technology fields is supporting apartment demand in the Boston metro area.  The Fairfield market continues to experience moderate economic growth due to the area’s greater exposure to the financial services sector, which has experienced slower job growth during this recovery than other industries.

The Northern California region accounted for approximately

18.1%

of the Established Community rental revenue for


and experienced a rental revenue increase of

7.7%

over the prior year. Average rental rates increased

7.6%

to

$2,524

per apartment home, and economic occupancy increased

0.1%

to

96.3%

for


as compared to


. While new apartment supply may slow revenue growth in future periods, we expect the strength in the technology industry to continue to fuel demand for apartment homes in 2015.



The Southern California region accounted for approximately

14.5%

of the Established Community rental revenue for


and experienced a rental revenue increase of

4.6%

over the prior year. Average rental rates increased

4.7%

to

$1,873

per apartment home, and were partially offset by a

0.1%

decrease in economic occupancy to

96.2%

for


as compared to


. Southern California has seen steady job growth and limited new apartment supply, which we expect will continue to support favorable operating results in 2015.

The Mid-Atlantic region, which represented approximately

10.2%

of the Established Community rental revenue during


, experienced a decrease in rental revenue of

0.5%

as compared to


. Average rental rates decreased by

0.2%

to

$1,969

per apartment home, and economic occupancy decreased

0.3%

to

95.5%

for


as compared to


. A combination of elevated levels of new apartment deliveries and job growth slightly below the expected national average are expected to challenge the region’s apartment fundamentals for 2015.

The Pacific Northwest region accounted for approximately

5.6%

of the Established Community rental revenue for


and experienced a rental revenue increase of

5.9%

over the prior year. Average rental rates increased

6.2%

to

$1,824

, and were partially offset by a decrease in economic occupancy of

0.3%

to

95.4%

for


as compared to


. The region’s on-line retail, technology and manufacturing sectors continue to support growth in the economy and apartment fundamentals. Rental revenue growth may be tempered in 2015 by the delivery of new apartment homes, particularly in the urban core of Seattle.

Management, development and other fees

decreased

$452,000

or

3.9%

, in


and increased

$1,245,000

, or

12.1%

, in


, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund I and Fund II, partially offset by increased property and asset management fees related to the Archstone Acquisition and related private real estate investment management funds (the U.S. Fund and the AC JV). The increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased property and asset management fees related to the Archstone Acquisition and related private real estate investment management funds (the U.S. Fund and the AC JV), partially offset by lower property and asset management fees earned as a result of dispositions from Fund I and Fund II.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes

increased

$50,696,000

, or

17.2%

, and

$84,064,000

, or

39.8%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment homes, including the communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition in February 2013.

For Established Communities, direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased

$7,475,000

, or

4.0%

, and

$4,374,000

, or

2.6%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to increased repairs and maintenance, utilities and payroll costs.

Property taxes

increased

$19,860,000

, or

12.5%

, and

$61,219,000

, or

62.8%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increases in 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to the net impact of the communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition as well as the addition of newly developed apartment communities, coupled with increased tax rates and assessments across our portfolio. The increase in 2014 was partially offset by reductions in expected supplemental billings related to communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

For Established Communities, property taxes increased

$6,206,000

, or

6.7%

, and

$4,282,000

, or

5.4%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to higher rates and assessments, as well as refunds received in the prior year in excess of the current year period.  The increase in 2013 was primarily due to higher rates and assessments, partially offset by higher successful appeals and refunds received in 2013, as compared to the prior year. For communities in California, property tax changes are determined by the change in the California Consumer Price Index, with increases limited by law (Proposition 13). Massachusetts also has laws that limit property tax increases. We evaluate property tax increases internally and also engage third-party consultants to assist in our evaluations. We appeal property tax increases when appropriate.

Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses

increased

$7,236,000

, or

13.6%

, and

$10,912,000

, or

25.9%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation related costs, coupled with increased activities related to re-branding and corporate initiatives, as well as increases associated with the Archstone Acquisition. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to increased compensation related costs, as well as the increase in corporate-level personnel and expenses associated with the Archstone Acquisition.

Investments and investment management

costs increased

$495,000

, or

12.4%

, in


and decreased by

$2,081,000

, or

34.3%

, in


as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increases in compensation costs, partially offset by a decline in our investment fund management activity. The decrease in 2013 was primarily due to reductions in compensation costs related to the relative decrease in our investment fund management activity.



Expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries

primarily reflect the costs incurred related to our asset investment activity, abandoned pursuit costs, which include costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights, acquisition pursuits and disposition pursuits, offset by any recoveries associated with acquisitions for periods prior to our ownership. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and the costs may vary significantly from period to period. These costs decreased

$48,767,000

, in


and increased

$33,700,000

, or

296.9%

, in


, as compared to the prior years, The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to receipts related to communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition for periods prior to the Company’s ownership, which are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds. The increase in 2013 over the prior year is due primarily to costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition.

Interest expense, net

increased

$8,216,000

, or

4.8%

, and

$35,482,000

, or

25.9%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development activity, amortization of the mark to market adjustment on debt assumed as part of the Archstone Acquisition, and interest income. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to increased unsecured debt outstanding, partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest related to our increased development activity. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to net interest costs on debt assumed in the Archstone Acquisition, partially offset by increased capitalized interest related to our increased development activity.

Loss on the extinguishment of debt, net

reflects

prepayment penalties, the expensing of deferred financing costs from our debt repurchase and retirement activity, or payments to acquire our outstanding debt at amounts above or below the carrying basis of the debt acquired, excluding costs related to debt secured by assets sold or held for sale.

Loss on interest rate contract

reflects the loss recorded by the Company related to the forward interest rate protection agreement that matured in May 2013. Based on changes in the Company's capital markets outlook in 2013, the Company did not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted.

Depreciation expense

decreased

$117,533,000

, or

21.0%

, in


and increased

$316,535,000

, or

129.9%

, in


, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to the impact of amortization for lease intangibles in 2013 not present in 2014, from communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to additional depreciation expense from the Archstone Acquisition, consisting largely of the depreciation of in-place lease intangibles, which were depreciated over a six month period.

General and administrative expense

("G&A") increased

$1,852,000

, or

4.7%

, and

$5,472,000

, or

16.0%

, in


and


, respectively, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, partially offset by legal recoveries in 2014 not present in the prior year. The increase in 2013 over 2012 was primarily due to increased compensation costs, including costs related to the Archstone Acquisition.

Casualty and impairment loss

for 2012 consists of the losses we incurred associated with Superstorm Sandy.

Equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated entities

increased by

$159,920,000

, in


and decreased

$32,068,000

, in


, as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2014 was primarily due to gains on the sales of communities in various ventures, including the Company's promoted interests, coupled with certain expensed transaction costs associated with the Archstone Acquisition that were incurred in 2013 through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with Equity Residential that were not present in 2014. The decrease in 2013 is primarily due to costs of approximately $39,543,000 associated with the Archstone Acquisition that were incurred through the unconsolidated joint venture entities owned with Equity Residential during the year.

Gain on sale of land

increased in


and decreased


as compared to the prior years, due to changes in volume and associated gains on the sale of land parcels.

Gain on sale of communities

increased in


over


, due to our implementation of new accounting guidance under ASU 2014-08 effective January 1, 2014, which impacted where we report income from operations as well as gains or losses from the disposition of operating communities. Gain on disposition for communities classified as held for sale subsequent to the adoption of the guidance is presented as part of this line item. For communities classified as held for sale prior to our adoption of ASU 2014-08, gain on sale is presented as gain on sale of discontinued operations.

Gain on acquisition of unconsolidated real estate entity

for 2012 represents the amount by which the fair value of our prior ownership interest in the joint venture that owned Avalon Del Rey exceeded our carrying value.

Income tax expense

for 2014 consists of federal income tax expense related to dispositions of the Company's direct and indirect interests in certain real estate assets acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, which were owned through a taxable REIT subsidiary.



Income from discontinued operations

represents the net income generated by real estate sold and qualifying as discontinued operations during the period from January 1, 2012 through

December 31, 2014

. Income from discontinued operations decreased in


and


, as compared to the prior years. The decrease in 2014 was due to the change in accounting guidance for discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08, with individual community dispositions no longer classified as such. The decrease in 2013 was due to changes in the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market conditions in the local area as compared to the prior year. See Note 7, "Real Estate Disposition Activities," to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gain on sale of discontinued operations

decreased in


and increased in


, as compared to the prior years. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. After our adoption of ASU 2014-08 as of January 1, 2014, gain on sale of communities is presented as gain on sale of communities.

Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests

resulted in an allocation of income of

$13,760,000

in


, and an allocation of loss of

$370,000

and

$307,000

in


and


, respectively. The amount for 2014 includes our joint venture partners' 84.8% interest in the gain on the sale of a Fund I community that was consolidated for financial reporting purposes, in the amount of $14,132,000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:

•

development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged;

•

the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code;

•

debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity; and

•

normal recurring operating expenses.

Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Operating cash flow has historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage, as well as our plans for development, redevelopment, acquisition and disposition activity, are affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.

In


, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from a variety of internal and external sources, which may include the physical settlement of the Forward, real estate dispositions, cash balances on hand, borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and/or the Term Loan, secured and unsecured debt financings, and other public or private sources of liquidity including the issuance of common and preferred equity, as well as cash generated from our operating activities. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects. Capital raising activities in


included asset sales, the Term Loan entered into in March, the issuance of common stock under CEP III (as defined below), and the issuance of unsecured notes in November.

Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled

$509,460,000

at

December 31, 2014

, an increase of

$228,105,000

from

$281,355,000

at

December 31, 2013

. The following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities—Net cash provided by operating activities increased to

$886,641,000

in


from

$724,315,000

in


. The increase was driven primarily by increased NOI from existing and newly developed communities, a decrease in acquisition costs, and the timing of payments of corporate obligations.

Investing Activities—Net cash used in investing activities of

$816,760,000

in


is related to investments in assets primarily through development and redevelopment, partially offset by proceeds received for dispositions and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures. In


, we invested

$1,341,657,000

in the following areas:

•

we invested

$1,241,832,000

in the development and redevelopment of communities;

•

we had capital expenditures of

$52,825,000

for our operating communities and non-real estate assets; and

•

we acquired one operating community for

$47,000,000

.



We received proceeds from dispositions of

$297,466,000

, and distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures in the amount of

$203,945,000

, associated primarily with the disposition of communities from CVP I, LLC, Fund I and Fund II.

Financing Activities—Net cash provided by financing activities totaled

$158,224,000

in


. The net cash provided is due to:

•

issuance of $300,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes;

•

issuance of common stock in the amount of

$295,465,000

through CEP III;

•

borrowing $250,000,000 under the Term Loan; and

•

secured borrowings of

$53,000,000

.

These amounts are partially offset by:

•

payment of cash dividends in the amount of

$593,643,000

;

•

repayment of unsecured notes in the amount of

$150,000,000

; and

•

repayment of secured notes in the amount of

$32,859,000

.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

The Company has a

$1,300,000,000

revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the "Credit Facility") which matures in April 2017. We may extend the maturity for up to

one

year through the exercise of

two

,

six

month extension options for an aggregate fee of

$1,950,000

. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is

LIBOR

plus

1.05%

(

1.22%

at

January 31, 2015

assuming a one month borrowing rate). The annual facility fee is

0.15%

(or approximately

$1,950,000

annually based on the

$1,300,000,000

facility size and based on our current credit rating).

We did not have any borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had

$47,963,000

outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of

January 31, 2015

.

Financial Covenants

We are subject to financial and other covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loan and the indenture under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:

•

limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;

•

limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and

•

minimum levels of debt service coverage.

We were in compliance with these covenants at

December 31, 2014

.

In addition, our secured borrowings may include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.

Continuous Equity Offering Program

In August 2012, we commenced a third continuous equity program ("CEP III"), under which we are authorized by our Board of Directors to sell up to

$750,000,000

of shares of our common stock from time to time during a


-month period. In conjunction with CEP III we have engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately

1.5%

of the gross sales price for shares sold. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, we sold

2,069,538

shares at an average sales price of

$144.95

per share, for net proceeds of

$295,465,000

.  As of

January 31, 2015

, we had

$346,304,000

of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program.



Forward Equity Contract

On September 9, 2014, based on a market closing price of $155.83 per share on that date, we entered into a forward contract to sell 4,500,000 shares of common stock for an initial forward price of $151.74 per share, net of offering fees and discounts (the "Forward"). The sales price and proceeds achieved will be determined on the date or dates of settlement, with adjustments during the term of the contract for our dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the Fed Funds rate. We generally have the ability to determine the date(s) and method of settlement, subject to certain conditions and the right of the Forward counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. Settlement may be (i) physical sale of shares of our common stock for cash, (ii) net cash settlement, whereby we will either pay or receive the difference between the Forward price and the weighted average market price for our common stock at the time of settlement, or (iii) net share settlement, whereby we will either receive or issue shares of our common stock, with the number of shares issued or received determined by the difference between the Forward price and the weighted average market price for its common stock at the time of settlement. The Forward price and the weighted average market price would in both cases by determined under the applicable terms of the Forward. Under either of the net settlement provisions, we will pay to the counterparty either cash or shares of common stock when the weighted average market price of our common stock at the time of settlement exceeds the Forward, and will receive either cash or issue shares of common stock to the extent that the weighted average market price of our common stock at the time of settlement is less than the price under the Forward. Settlement of the Forward will occur on one or more dates not later than September 8, 2015.

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Debt Maturities

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity.  For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility or Term Loan. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.

The following debt activity occurred during


:

•

In March 2014, we entered into a

$300,000,000

variable rate unsecured term loan that matures in March 2021 (the “Term Loan”).  At

December 31, 2014

, we had drawn

$250,000,000

of the available

$300,000,000

, with the option to draw the additional

$50,000,000

until March 2015.

•

In April 2014, in conjunction with certain requirements associated with the development of an apartment community, we entered into a

$53,000,000

secured mortgage loan maturing in 2019, with an option to extend the maturity to 2024.  The mortgage is comprised of a

$15,000,000

fixed rate note with an interest rate of

2.99%

and a

$38,000,000

variable rate note at LIBOR plus

2.00%

.

•

Pursuant to its scheduled maturity in April 2014, we repaid

$150,000,000

principal amount of unsecured notes with a stated coupon of

5.375%

.

•

In June 2014, in conjunction with the disposition of an operating community, we repaid a fixed rate secured mortgage loan in the amount of

$10,427,000

with an interest rate of

6.19%

in advance of its November 2015 maturity date. In accordance with the requirements of the master credit agreement governing this and certain other secured borrowings, we repaid an additional

$5,914,000

principal amount of secured borrowings for eight other operating communities. We incurred a charge for early debt extinguishment of

$412,000

.

•

In November 2014, we issued

$300,000,000

principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under its existing shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately

$295,803,000

. The notes mature in

November 2024

and were issued at a stated coupon of

3.50%

.

The following table details our consolidated debt maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at

December 31, 2014

(dollars in thousands) as compared to the amounts of debt outstanding as of at

December 31, 2013

. We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.

This community was sold in January 2015, at which time we substituted another operating community as collateral for the borrowing.

(10)

In January 2015, we experienced a fire at Edgewater.  As of the date of this Form 10-K there has been no change in the terms and conditions of the financing secured by Edgewater, and we are complying with all lender requirements.  The mortgage note stipulates that in the event of a casualty loss such as the Edgewater fire, the lender has absolute discretion to determine the disposition of the insurance proceeds, and can compel us (i) to direct the insurance proceeds to be used for the restoration of Edgewater, or (ii) to apply the insurance proceeds to repay the outstanding loan balance, at par.  We are currently working with the lender to resolve open issues related to this matter.

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Portfolio and Other Activity

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had


wholly-owned communities under construction and

eight

wholly-owned communities under reconstruction. Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction and fund development costs related to pursuing Development Rights will be funded from:

•

our

$1,300,000,000

Credit Facility;

•

the remaining

$50,000,000

capacity under our Term Loan;

•

cash currently on hand, invested in highly liquid overnight money market funds and repurchase agreements, and short-term investment vehicles;

•

retained operating cash;

•

the net proceeds from sales of existing communities;

•

the issuance of debt or equity securities, including through the Forward; and/or

•

private equity funding, including joint venture activity.

Before planned construction or reconstruction activity, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures begins, or the construction of a Development Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.

From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.

In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI. However, we believe that the absence of future cash flows from communities sold will have a minimal impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.



Unconsolidated Real Estate Investments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Unconsolidated Investments

Fund I, Fund II and the U.S. Fund (collectively the “Funds”) were established to engage in real estate acquisition programs through discretionary investment funds.  We believe this investment format provides the following attributes: (i) third-party joint venture equity as an additional source of financing to expand and diversify our portfolio; (ii) additional sources of income in the form of property management and asset management fees and, potentially, incentive distributions if the performance of the Funds exceeds certain thresholds; and (iii) additional visibility into the transactions occurring in multi-family assets that helps us with other investment decisions related to our wholly-owned portfolio.

Fund I has

nine

institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund I, has a

15.2%

combined general partner and limited partner equity interest, and has fully recovered its basis as of

December 31, 2014

, with any additional liquidation proceeds to be recognized in earnings as received. Fund I was our principal vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in March 2005 through the close of its investment period in March 2008. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015. In 2014, Fund I sold its final

four

apartment communities.

Fund II has

six

institutional investors, including us. One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of Fund II, we have an equity investment of

$92,162,000

(net of distributions), representing a

31.3%

combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities from its formation in 2008 through the close of its investment period in August 2011. Fund II has a term that expires in August 2020, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options.

The U.S. Fund has

six

institutional investors, including us. We are the general partner of the U.S. Fund and, excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the U.S. Fund, we have an equity investment of

$88,220,000

(net of distributions), representing a

28.6%

combined equity interest. The U.S. Fund was formed in July 2011 and is fully invested. The U.S. Fund has a term that expires in July 2023, assuming the exercise of two, one-year extension options. We acquired our interest in the U.S. Fund as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

In addition, as part of the Archstone Acquisition, we acquired an interest in the AC JV, which has

four

institutional investors, including us. Excluding costs incurred in excess of our equity in the underlying net assets of the AC JV, we have an equity investment of

$69,633,000

(net of distributions), representing a

20.0%

equity interest. The AC JV was formed in 2011.

As of

December 31, 2014

, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  Refer to Note 6, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. Detail of the real estate and associated funding underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In addition to our investment interests in consolidated and unconsolidated real estate entities, we have certain off-balance sheet arrangements with the entities in which we invest. Additional discussion of these entities can be found in Note 6, "Investments in Real Estate Entities," of our Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this report.

•

As of

December 31, 2014

, subsidiaries of Fund II have


loans secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of

$358,811,000

with varying maturity dates (and, in some cases, dates after which the loans can be prepaid without penalty), ranging from January 2016 to September 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II with operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. We have not guaranteed the debt of Fund II, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so.

In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than

10%

of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately

$8,910,000

as of

December 31, 2014

). As of

December 31, 2014

, the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to cover the guaranteed distribution amount to that partner under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario. The estimated fair value of, and our obligation under, this guarantee, both at inception and as of

December 31, 2014

, was not significant and therefore we have not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of

December 31, 2014

.

Each individual mortgage loan of Fund II was made to a special purpose, single asset subsidiary of Fund II. Each mortgage loan provides that it is the obligation of the respective subsidiary only, except under exceptional circumstances (such as fraud or misapplication of funds) in which case Fund II could also have obligations with respect to the mortgage loan. In no event do the mortgage loans provide for recourse against investors in Fund II, including against us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries that invest in Fund II. A default by Fund II or a Fund II subsidiary on any loan to it would not constitute a default under any of our loans or any loans of our other non-Fund subsidiaries or affiliates. If Fund II or a subsidiary of Fund II were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, the value of our investment in Fund II would likely decline and we might also be more likely to be obligated under the guarantee we provided to Fund II partners as described above.  If a Fund II subsidiary or Fund II were unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we and/or the other investors might evaluate whether it was in our respective interests to voluntarily support Fund II through additional equity contributions and/or take other actions to avoid a default under a loan or the consequences of a default (such as foreclosure of a Fund II asset).

In the future, in the event Fund II was unable to meet its obligations under a loan, we cannot predict at this time whether we would provide any voluntary support, or take any other action, as any such action would depend on a variety of factors, including the amount of support required and the possibility that such support could enhance the return of Fund II and/or our returns by providing time for performance to improve.

•

As of

December 31, 2014

There are no other material lines of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between our unconsolidated real estate entities and us. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage, management takes into consideration our proportionate share of the indebtedness of unconsolidated entities in which we have an interest.

Contractual Obligations

Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of

December 31, 2014

(dollars in thousands):

_________________________________

(1)

Includes land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142. Amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases.

(2)

Aggregate capital lease payments include

$28,318

in interest costs.



Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. In an inflationary environment, this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases. Similarly, in a deflationary rent environment, we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains "forward-looking statements" as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate," "assume," "project," "plan," "may," "shall," "will" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:

•

our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities;

•

the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;

•

the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;

•

the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;

•

the anticipated operating performance of our communities;

•

cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates;

•

our declaration or payment of distributions;

•

our joint venture and discretionary fund activities;

•

our policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters;

•

our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code;

•

the real estate markets in Northern and Southern California and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England, Metro New York/New Jersey and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general;

•

the availability of debt and equity financing;

•

interest rates;

•

general economic conditions including the potential impacts from economic conditions; and

•

trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.

Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

our preliminary expectations and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding insurance coverage, lender payoff and refinancing requirements and potential uninsured loss amounts resulting from the Edgewater fire, as well as the ultimate cost and timing of replacing the Edgewater building and achieving stabilized occupancy, are subject to change and could materially affect our current expectations regarding the impact of the fire on our financial condition and results of operations;



•

the expected proceeds from settlement of the Forward are subject to adjustment for changes in the Fed Funds rate and the amount of dividends we pay on our common stock, and our receipt of settlement proceeds assumes that we will settle the Forward by physical delivery;

•

we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;

•

we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses;

•

construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;

•

we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;

•

occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;

•

financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;

•

our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;

•

we may be unsuccessful in our management of Fund I, Fund II, the U.S. Fund, the AC JV or the REIT vehicles that are used with each of them; and

•

we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our portfolio composition.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation," of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Principles of Consolidation

We may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets. We must determine for each of these ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting.

We determine whether to consolidate certain entities based on our rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements, applying the applicable accounting guidance. For investment interests that we do not consolidate, we evaluate the guidance to determine the accounting framework to apply. The application of the rules in evaluating the accounting treatment for each joint venture is complex and requires substantial management judgment. Therefore, we believe the decision to choose an appropriate accounting framework is a critical accounting estimate.

If we were to consolidate the joint ventures that we accounted for using the equity method, excluding joint venture entities the company formed with Equity Residential as part of the Archstone Acquisition, at

December 31, 2014

, our assets would have increased by

$1,391,602,000

and our liabilities would have increased by

$1,005,012,000

. We would be required to consolidate those joint ventures currently not consolidated for financial reporting purposes if the facts and circumstances changed, including but not limited to the following reasons, none of which are currently expected to occur:

•

For entities not considered to be variable interest entities, the nature of the entity changed such that it would be considered a variable interest entity and we were considered the primary beneficiary.

•

For entities in which we do not hold a controlling voting and/or variable interest, the contractual arrangement changed resulting in our investment interest being either a controlling voting and/or variable interest.



We evaluate our accounting for investments on a regular basis including when a significant change in the design of an entity occurs.

Cost Capitalization

We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. We defer costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease

During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total

$37,433,000

,

$38,128,000

and

$26,513,000

for


,


and


, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.

There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. For example, if in


our development activities decreased by 10%, and there were no corresponding decrease in our indirect project costs, our costs charged to expense would have increased by

$3,743,000

.

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.

Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. If we had determined that 10% of our capitalized pursuit costs were associated with Development Rights that were no longer probable of occurring, net income for the year ended

December 31, 2014

would have decreased by

$6,703,000

.

Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment

We evaluate our real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.

We expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.

Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.



REIT Status

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a REIT. We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders over time periods allowed under the Code. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to elect to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. For example, if we failed to qualify as a REIT in


, our net income would have decreased by approximately

$274,794,000

.

Our qualification as a REIT requires management to exercise significant judgment and consideration with respect to operational matters and accounting treatment. Therefore, we believe our REIT status is a critical accounting estimate.

Acquisition of Investments in Real Estate

We account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which requires the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to be recognized at fair value. Typical assets and liabilities acquired include land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize various sources, including our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates. We do not have exposure to any other significant market risk. We monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates, primarily in short-term LIBOR and the SIFMA index as a result of borrowings under our Credit Facility and outstanding bonds with variable interest rates. In addition, the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates. The effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy.

As of

December 31, 2014

and


, we had

$1,297,461,000

and

$1,011,609,000

, respectively, in variable rate debt outstanding, with no amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout


and


, our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately

$13,035,000

and

$9,680,000

, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years. In 2013, in conjunction with the Archstone Acquisition, we assumed approximately

$2,034,482,000

secured fixed and floating rate indebtedness, which impacted the Company's overall exposure to interest rate risk. In May 2013, a

$215,000,000

forward interest rate protection agreement matured, resulting in a payment to the counterparty of

$51,000,000

, the fair value at time of settlement.

Because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and the current valuation of the position is a net liability for us, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider.

In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes, considering our current market yields, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (including amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility) with an aggregate carrying value of

$6,448,138,000

at

December 31, 2014

had an estimated aggregate fair value of

$6,558,022,000

at

December 31, 2014

. Contractual fixed rate debt represented

$5,443,736,000

of the fair value at

December 31, 2014

. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of

December 31, 2014

, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately

$365,417,000

.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for reporting discontinued operations effective January 1, 2014.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.:

We have audited AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.  as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of AvalonBay Communities, Inc. and our report dated

February 19, 2015

expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Organization and Basis of Presentation

Organization

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries), is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”).  The Company focuses on the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and operation of multifamily communities primarily in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California.

At

December 31, 2014

, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in


operating apartment communities containing

73,963

apartment homes in


states and the District of Columbia, of which

eight

communities containing

2,938

apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in


communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of

8,524

apartment homes when completed. The Company also owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in land or rights to land in which the Company expects to develop an additional


communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated

10,384

apartment homes.

Capitalized terms used without definition have meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain joint venture partnerships, subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs and any variable interest entities that qualified for consolidation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The Company accounts for joint venture entities and subsidiary partnerships that are not variable interest entities in accordance with the guidance applicable to limited partnerships or similar entities. The Company evaluates the partnership of each joint venture entity and determines whether control over the partnership lies with the general partner or, when the limited partners have certain rights, with the limited partners. The Company consolidates an investment when both (i) the Company is the general partner and (ii) the limited partner interests do not overcome the Company's presumption of control by having either substantive participating rights, the ability to remove the Company as the general partner or the ability to dissolve the partnership.

The Company generally uses the equity method under all other potential scenarios, including where (i) the Company holds a general partner interest but the presumption of control by the Company is overcome by the limited partner interests as described in the preceding paragraph or (ii) the Company holds a noncontrolling limited partner interest in a joint venture. Investments in which the Company has little or no influence are accounted for using the cost method.

Revenue and Gain Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents as required by the accounting guidance applicable to leases, which provides guidance on classification and recognition. In accordance with the Company's standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease, which is generally

one

year. The Company records a charge to income for outstanding receivables greater than 90 days past due as a component of operating expenses, excluding property taxes on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

The Company accounts for the sale of real estate assets and any related gain recognition in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable to sales of real estate, which establishes standards for recognition of profit on all real estate sales transactions, other than retail land sales. The Company recognizes the sale, and associated gain or loss from the disposition, provided that the earnings process is complete and the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale.

Real Estate

Operating real estate assets are stated at cost and consist of land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their development, redevelopment and acquisition. Significant expenditures which improve or extend the life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

F-9


Improvements and upgrades are generally capitalized only if the item exceeds

$15,000

, extends the useful life of the asset and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident. Purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, are generally capitalized only if the item is a new addition and exceeds

$2,500

. The Company generally expenses purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes.

Project costs related to the development, construction and redevelopment of real estate projects (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct costs) are capitalized as a cost of the project. Indirect project costs that relate to several projects are capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Indirect costs not clearly related to development, construction and redevelopment activity are expensed as incurred. For development, capitalization (i) begins when the Company has determined that development of the future asset is probable, (ii) can be suspended if there is no current development activity underway, but future development is still probable and (iii) ends when the asset, or a portion of an asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, or the Company's intended use changes such that capitalization is no longer appropriate. For redevelopment efforts, the Company capitalizes costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are recognized in earnings as incurred. The Company defers costs associated with originating new leases, recognizing the impact of these costs in earnings over the term of the lease.

The Company acquired as a Development Right

one

land parcel partially improved with office buildings, industrial space and other commercial and residential ventures occupied by unrelated third parties. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company is actively pursuing development of this parcel. For the land parcel for which the Company intends to pursue development, the Company will manage the current improvements until such time as all tenant obligations have been satisfied or eliminated through negotiation, and construction of new apartment communities is ready to begin. Revenue from incidental operations received from the current improvements on these land parcels in excess of any incremental costs are being recorded as a reduction of total capitalized costs of the Development Right and not as part of net income.

In connection with the acquisition of an operating community, the Company identifies and records each asset acquired and liability assumed in such transaction at its estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocations to tangible assets, such as land, buildings and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and the in-place lease intangible assets, are reflected in real estate assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Any purchase price allocation to intangible assets, other than in-place lease intangibles, is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the term of the acquired intangible asset. The Company expenses all costs incurred related to acquisitions of operating communities. The Company values land based on a market approach, looking to recent sales of similar properties, adjusting for differences due to location, the state of entitlement as well as the shape and size of the parcel. Improvements to land are valued using a replacement cost approach and consider the structures and amenities included for the communities. The approach applies industry standard replacement costs adjusted for geographic specific considerations, and reduced by estimated depreciation. The value for furniture, fixtures and equipment is also determined based on a replacement cost approach, considering costs for both items in the apartment homes as well as common areas and is adjusted for estimated depreciation.  The fair value of buildings acquired is estimated using the replacement cost approach, assuming the buildings were vacant at acquisition. The replacement cost approach considers the composition of structures acquired, adjusted for an estimate of depreciation. The estimate of depreciation is made considering industry standard information and depreciation curves for the identified asset classes. The value of the acquired lease-related intangibles considers the estimated cost of leasing the apartment homes as if the acquired building(s) were vacant, as well as the value of the current leases relative to market-rate leases. The in-place lease value is determined using an average total lease-up time, the number of apartment homes and net revenues generated during the lease-up time. The lease-up period for an apartment community is assumed to be 12 months to achieve stabilized occupancy. Net revenues use market rent considering actual leasing and industry rental rate data. The value of current leases relative to a market-rate lease is based on market rents obtained for market comparables, and considered a market derived discount rate. Given the significance of unobservable inputs used in the value of real estate assets acquired, it classifies them as Level 3 prices in the fair value hierarchy.

Depreciation is calculated on buildings and improvements using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from

seven

to


years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from

three

years (primarily computer-related equipment) to

seven

years.

Income Taxes

As of

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe that there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. The Company is subject to examination by the respective taxing authorities for the tax years


through


.

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for its tax year ended December 31, 1994 and has not revoked such election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and can deduct from its federally taxable income

F-10


qualifying dividends it pays if it meets a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least

90%

of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. Therefore, as a REIT the Company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income if it distributes

100%

of its taxable income over the time period allowed under the Code to its stockholders. The states in which the Company operates have similar tax provisions which recognize the Company as a REIT for state income tax purposes. Management believes that all such conditions for the avoidance of income taxes on ordinary income have been or will be met for the periods presented. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes has been made. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. The Company did not incur any charges or receive refunds of excise taxes related to the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities performed through taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. The Company incurred income tax expense of

$9,368,000

in 2014 associated with disposition activities transacted through a TRS. See Note 6, "Investments in Real Estate Entities" and Note 7, "Real Estate Disposition Activities," for further discussion.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and other expenditures necessary to obtain debt financing and are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the shorter of the term of the loan or the related credit enhancement facility, if applicable. Unamortized financing costs are charged to earnings when debt is retired before the maturity date. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was

$24,444,000

as of

December 31, 2014

and

$19,719,000

as of

December 31, 2013

.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Cash in Escrow

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date acquired. Cash in escrow includes principal reserve funds that are restricted for the repayment of specified secured financing. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow are held at major commercial banks.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Equity, reflects the effective portion of the cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships.

F-11


Earnings per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted share awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method of computing basic earnings per share ("EPS"). Both the unvested restricted shares and other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis. The Company's earnings per common share are determined as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):

Certain options to purchase shares of common stock in the amount of

605,899

and

396,346

were outstanding as of

December 31, 2013

and


, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because such options were anti-dilutive for the period. All options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding as of

December 31, 2014

are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.

The Company is required to estimate the forfeiture of stock options and recognize compensation cost net of the estimated forfeitures. The estimated forfeitures included in compensation cost are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures at the end of the vesting period. The forfeiture rate at

December 31, 2014

was

1.4%

and is based on the average forfeiture activity over a period equal to the estimated life of the stock options. The application of estimated forfeitures did not materially impact compensation expense for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


.

Abandoned Pursuit Costs, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Casualty Loss

The Company evaluates its real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. Such assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, the Company

F-12


assesses its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, the Company did not recognize any impairment losses for wholly-owned operating real estate assets.

The Company capitalizes pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which the Company currently believes future development is probable ("Development Rights"). Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and the availability of capital. Initial pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development by the Company no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense. The Company expensed costs related to the abandonment of Development Rights as well as costs incurred in pursuing the acquisition of assets or costs incurred pursuing the disposition of assets for which such acquisition and disposition activity did not occur, in the amounts of

$3,964,000

,

$998,000

and

$1,757,000

during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. These costs are included in expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future periods.

The Company evaluates its real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment if the intent of the Company changes with respect to either the development of, or the expected hold period for, the land. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges for land holdings in


,


or


.

The Company also evaluates its unconsolidated investments for other than temporary impairment, considering both the extent and amount by which the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment to recover its carrying value. The Company also evaluates its proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. There were

no

other than temporary impairment losses recognized by any of the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities during the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


or


.

During the year ended

December 31, 2012

the Company incurred damages related to Superstorm Sandy at certain of its communities on the East Coast, and recognized a charge of

$1,449,000

for the casualty loss associated with this damage on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The Company did not incur a casualty loss in


or


. A casualty loss may also result in lost operating income from one or more communities that is covered by the Company’s business interruption insurance policies.  The Company recognizes income for amounts received under its business interruption insurance policies as a component of rental and other income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Revenue is recognized upon resolution of all contingencies related to the receipt, typically upon written confirmation by the insurer or receipt of the actual proceeds.  The Company recognized

$2,494,000

and

$299,000

in income related business interruption insurance proceeds for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There were

no

business interruption insurance proceeds received in 2012.

See Note 14, "Subsequent Events," for discussion of the fire at Avalon at Edgewater.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations

The Company presents the assets and liabilities of any communities which have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the results of operations for those assets that meet the definition of discontinued operations are presented as such in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Held for sale and discontinued operations classifications are provided in both the current and prior periods presented. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell. Both the real estate assets and corresponding liabilities are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. For those assets qualifying for classification as discontinued operations, the specific components of net income presented as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation expense and interest expense, net. For periods prior to the asset qualifying for discontinued operations, the Company reclassifies the results of operations to discontinued operations. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment loss) on the eventual disposal of assets held for sale will be presented as discontinued operations when recognized. A change in presentation for held for sale or discontinued operations will not have any impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The Company combines the operating, investing and financing portions of cash flows attributable to discontinued operations with the respective cash flows from continuing operations on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company ha

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

F-13


Redeemable noncontrolling interests are comprised of potential future obligations of the Company, which allow the investors holding the noncontrolling interest to require the Company to purchase their interest. The Company classifies obligations under the redeemable noncontrolling interests at fair value, with a corresponding offset for changes in the fair value recorded in accumulated earnings less dividends. Reductions in fair value are recorded only to the extent that the Company has previously recorded increases in fair value above the redeemable noncontrolling interest's initial basis. The redeemable noncontrolling interests are presented outside of permanent equity as settlement in shares of the Company's common stock shares, where permitted, may not be within the Company's control. The nature and valuation of the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests are discussed further in Note 12, "Fair Value."

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company enters into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements (collectively, "Hedging Derivatives") for interest rate risk management purposes and in conjunction with certain variable rate secured debt to satisfy lender requirements. The Company does not enter into Hedging Derivative transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company assesses the effectiveness of qualifying cash flow and fair value hedges, both at inception and on an on-going basis. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported as a component of general and administrative expenses. The fair values of Hedging Derivatives that are in an asset position are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets. The fair value of Hedging Derivatives that are in a liability position are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. Other than the

$51,000,000

loss on interest rate contract recorded during 2013, fair value changes for derivatives that are not in qualifying hedge relationships are reported as a component of interest expense, net. For the Hedging Derivative positions that the Company has determined qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the Company has recorded the effective portion of cumulative changes in the fair value of the Hedging Derivatives in other comprehensive income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flow. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the Hedging Derivatives that the Company has determined qualified as effective fair value hedges is reported as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding debt being hedged.  See Note 12, "Fair Value," for further discussion of derivative financial instruments.

Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests represent our joint venture partners' claims on consolidated investments where the Company owns less than a

100%

interest. The Company records these interests at their initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for the joint venture partners' share of the respective consolidated investments' results of operations and applicable changes in ownership.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years' financial statements to conform to current year presentations as a result of discontinued operations and changes in held for sale classification as described in Note 7, “Real Estate Disposition Activities.”

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ("FASB") (ASU) 2014-08, guidance updating the accounting and reporting for discontinued operations. Under the recently issued guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (e.g., a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, the final standard requires expanded disclosures about dispositions that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of discontinued operations, as well as disposals of a significant part of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The final standard is effective in the first quarter of 2015 and allows for early adoption. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2014, as discussed in Note 7, “Real Estate Disposition Activities.”

In May 2014, the FASB issued a revenue recognition standard that will result in companies recognizing revenue from contracts when control for the service or product that is the subject of the contract is transferred from the seller to the buyer. The Company will be required to apply the new standard in the first quarter of 2017 and is assessing whether the new standard will have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations.

and


, the Company's charter had authorized for issuance a total of

280,000,000

shares of common stock and

50,000,000

shares of preferred stock.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company:

(i)

issued

2,069,538

common shares through public offerings under CEP III, discussed below;

(ii)

issued

500,197

shares of common stock in connection with stock options exercised;

(iii)

issued

common shares through the Company's dividend reinvestment plan;

(iv)

issued

common shares in connection with stock grants and the conversion of restricted stock units to restricted shares;

(v)

withheld

55,523

common shares to satisfy employees' tax withholding and other liabilities;

(vi)

canceled

7,970

shares of restricted stock upon forfeiture; and

(vii)

issued

9,848

shares through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Any deferred compensation related to the Company’s stock option and restricted stock grants during the year ended

December 31, 2014

is not reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of

December 31, 2014

, and will not be reflected until earned as compensation cost.

In August 2012, the Company commenced a third continuous equity program ("CEP III"), under which the Company is authorized by its Board of Directors to sell up to

$750,000,000

of shares of its common stock from time to time during a


-month period. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and determinations by the Company of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. In conjunction with CEP III, the Company engaged sales agents who receive compensation of approximately

1.5%

of the gross sales price for shares sold. During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company sold

2,069,538

shares at an average sales price of

$144.95

per share, for net proceeds of

$295,465,000

. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had

$346,304,000

of shares remaining authorized for issuance under this program.

On September 9, 2014, based on a market closing price of

$155.83

per share on that date, the Company entered into a forward contract to sell

4,500,000

shares of common stock for an initial forward price of

$151.74

per share, net of offering fees and discounts (the "Forward"). The sales price and proceeds achieved by the Company will be determined on the date or dates of settlement, with adjustments during the term of the contract for the Company’s dividends as well as for a daily interest factor that varies with changes in the Fed Funds rate. The Company generally has the ability to determine the date(s) and method of settlement, subject to certain conditions and the right of the Forward counterparty to accelerate settlement under certain circumstances. Settlement may be (i) physical sale of shares of our common stock for cash, (ii) net cash settlement, whereby the Company will either pay or receive the difference between the forward contract price and the weighted average market price for its common stock at the time of settlement, or (iii) net share settlement, whereby the Company will either receive or issue shares of its common stock, with the number of shares issued or received determined by the difference between the Forward price and the weighted average market price for its common stock at the time of settlement. The Forward price and the weighted average market price would in both cases by determined under the applicable terms of the Forward.  Under either of the net settlement provisions, the Company will pay to the counterparty either cash or shares of its common stock when the weighted average market price of its common stock at the time of settlement exceeds the Forward price, and will receive either cash or issue shares of its common stock to the extent that the weighted average market price of its common stock at the time of settlement is less than the price under the Forward. Settlement of the Forward will occur on one or more dates not later than September 8, 2015. The Company accounts for the Forward as equity. Before the issuance of shares of the Company’s common stock, if any, upon physical or net share settlement of the Forward, the Company expects that the shares issuable upon settlement of the Forward will be reflected in its diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock used in calculating diluted earnings per share is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares of common stock that would be issued upon full physical settlement of the Forward over the number of shares of common stock that could be purchased by the Company in the market (based on the average market price during the period) using the proceeds receivable upon full physical settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of the reporting period). If and when the Company physically or net share settles the Forward, the delivery of shares of our common stock would result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding and dilution to our earnings per share.

Archstone Acquisition

On February 27, 2013, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated November 26, 2012, by and among the Company, Equity Residential and its operating partnership, ERP Operating Limited Partnership (together, “Equity Residential”), Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.

of which excess related to debt the Company repaid concurrent with the Archstone Acquisition;

•

the acquisition with Equity Residential of interests in entities that have preferred units outstanding, some of which may be presented for redemption from time to time. The Company's

40%

share of the fair value of the collective obligations, including accrued dividends on these outstanding Archstone preferred units as of February 27, 2013, was approximately

$67,500,000

; and

•

Investments in Real Estate Entities

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate entities under the equity method of accounting, except as otherwise noted below, as discussed in Note 1, "Organization and Basis of Presentation," under

Principles of Consolidation

. The significant accounting policies of the Company's unconsolidated real estate entities are consistent with those of the Company in all material respects.

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company had investments in the following real estate entities:

•

AvalonBay Value Added Fund, LP ("Fund I")

—In March 2005, the Company formed Fund I, a private, discretionary real estate investment vehicle, which acquired and operated communities in the Company's markets. Fund I served as the principal vehicle through which the Company acquired investments in apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions, until March 2008. Fund I has a term that expires in March 2015, after having exercised

two

one

-year extension options. During 2014, Fund I sold its final

four

apartment communities. Fund I has

nine

institutional investors, including the Company.  A significant portion of the investments made in Fund I by its investors were made through AvalonBay Value Added Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation that qualifies as a REIT under the Code (the "Fund I REIT"). A wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company is the general partner of Fund I, has a

15.2%

combined general partner and limited partner equity interest, and

F-19


has fully recovered its basis as of

December 31, 2014

, with any additional liquidation proceeds to be recognized in earnings as received. During the period which Fund I was invested in apartment communities, the Company received asset management fees, property management fees and redevelopment fees.

During


, Fund I sold its final

four

communities:

•

Weymouth Place, located in Weymouth, MA, for

$25,750,000

;

•

South Hills Apartments, located in West Covina, CA, for

$21,800,000

;

•

The Springs, located in Corona, CA, for

$43,200,000

; and

•

Avalon Rutherford Station, located in East Rutherford, NJ, for

$34,250,000

.

The Company's proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP recognized on the sale of these

four

communities was

$3,317,000

.

The net assets and results of operations of The Springs were consolidated for financial reporting purposes. As a result,

100%

of the gain recognized of

$16,656,000

is included in gain on sale of communities in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and the Company's joint venture partners'

84.8%

interest in this gain of

$14,132,000

is reported as a component of net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. Concurrent with the disposition of The Springs, Fund I repaid its obligation to the Company under a fixed rate secured mortgage loan in the amount of

$21,748,000

with an interest rate of

6.06%

in advance of its October 2014 maturity date. Upon repayment the Company deconsolidated the net assets of The Springs.

In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund I repaid

$43,771,000

of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. This resulted in a charge for a prepayment penalty, of which the Company’s portion was

$328,000

and was reported as a reduction of equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated real estate entities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

•

AvalonBay Value Added Fund II, LP ("Fund II")

—In September 2008, the Company formed Fund II, a private, discretionary real estate investment vehicle which acquired and operates communities in the Company's markets. Fund II served as the exclusive vehicle through which the Company acquired investment interests in apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions, through the close of its investment period in August 2011. Fund II has

six

institutional investors, including the Company. One of the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner of Fund II and at

December 31, 2014

, excluding costs incurred in excess of equity in the underlying net assets of Fund II, the Company has an equity investment of

$92,162,000

(net of distributions), representing a

31.3%

combined general partner and limited partner equity interest.

During


, Fund II sold

two

communities:

•

Avalon Fair Oaks, located in Fairfax, VA, for

$108,200,000

and

•

Avalon Bellevue Park, located in Bellevue, WA, for

$58,750,000

.

The Company's proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP for the

two

dispositions was

$21,624,000

.

In conjunction with the disposition of these communities, Fund II repaid

$63,407,000

of related secured indebtedness in advance of the scheduled maturity dates. This resulted in charges for prepayment penalties, of which the Company’s portion was

$1,364,000

and was reported as a reduction of equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated real estate entities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. In addition, during


, Fund II repaid an outstanding mortgage note at par in the amount of

$42,023,000

.

Subsidiaries of Fund II have


loans secured by individual assets with aggregate amounts outstanding of

$358,811,000

, with maturity dates that vary from January 2016 to September 2019. The mortgage loans are payable by the subsidiaries of Fund II from operating cash flow or disposition proceeds from the underlying real estate. The Company has not guaranteed repayment of this debt, nor does the Company have any obligation to fund this debt should Fund II be unable to do so.

In addition, as part of the formation of Fund II, the Company provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee. The guarantee provides that if, upon final liquidation of Fund II, the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of Fund II (whether from operating cash flow or property sales) does not equal a minimum of the total capital contributions made by that partner, then the Company will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall, but in no event more than

10%

of the total capital contributions made by the partner (maximum of approximately

$8,910,000

as of

December 31, 2014

). Under the expected Fund II liquidation scenario, as of

December 31, 2014

the expected realizable value of the real estate assets owned by Fund II is considered adequate to avoid payment under such guarantee to that partner. The estimated

F-20


fair value of, and the Company's obligation under, this guarantee, both at inception and as of

December 31, 2014

, was not significant and therefore the Company has not recorded any obligation for this guarantee as of

December 31, 2014

.

Investments in Consolidated Real Estate Entities

In December 2014, the Company acquired Avalon Mission Oaks, located in Camarillo, CA. Avalon Mission Oaks contains


apartment homes and was acquired for a purchase price of

$47,000,000

.  The Company accounted for this acquisition as a business combination and recorded the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including identifiable intangibles, at their fair values. The Company looked to third party pricing or internal models for the values of the land, and an internal model to determine the fair values of the real estate assets and in-place leases. Given the heterogeneous nature of multifamily real estate, the fair values for the land, real estate assets and in-place leases incorporated significant unobservable inputs and therefore are considered to be Level 3 prices within the fair value hierarchy.

The Company expenses transaction costs associated with acquisition activity as they are incurred. To the extent the Company receives amounts related to acquired communities for periods prior to their acquisition, the Company reports these receipts, net with expensed acquisition costs. In 2014, the Company received amounts related to communities acquired in the Archstone Acquisition, for periods prior to the Company’s ownership, in excess of acquisition costs incurred, resulting in a net recovery of

$7,681,000

. These amounts are primarily comprised of property tax and mortgage insurance refunds. Expensed transaction costs associated with the acquisitions made by the Company in


and


, including those for the Archstone Acquisition, totaled

$44,052,000

and

$9,593,000

, respectively. These amounts are reported as a component of expensed acquisition, development and other pursuit costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company entered into a joint venture to acquire a land parcel and construct a mixed use building that will contain rental apartments, for-sale residential condominium units and related common elements. The Company will own a

70%

interest in the venture and have all of the rights and obligations associated with the rental apartments, and the venture partner will own the remaining

30%

interest and have all of the rights and obligations associated with the for-sale condominium units. The Company will share responsibility for the development and oversee construction of the structure. Upon formation of the venture, the Company and its venture partner made capital contributions, with costs incurred subsequent to the initial contributions to be funded through a loan provided by the Company. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company's aggregate investment in the venture is

$11,161,000

and is reported as a component of land held for development on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had provided funding for the venture partner’s share of costs in the amount of

$5,354,000

reported as a component of prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, recognizing interest income as earned as a component of interest expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The loan provided to the venture partner will be repaid with the proceeds received from the sale of the residential condominium units. The venture is considered a variable interest entity, and the Company will consolidate its interest in the rental apartments and common areas, and account for the for-sale component of the venture as an unconsolidated investment.

Commitments and Contingencies

Employment Agreements and Arrangements

As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company has employment agreements with

two

executive officers which expire on December 31, 2015. Under the employment agreements, if the Company terminates the executive without cause the executive will be entitled to a multiple of his covered compensation, which is defined as base salary plus annual cash bonus. For

one

of the executives, the multiple is

two

times (

three

if the termination is in connection with a sale of the Company) and for the other executive the multiple is

one

time (

two

if the termination is in connection with a sale of the Company). The employment agreements generally provide that it would be considered a termination without cause if the executive's title or role is reduced except as permitted by the agreement. The agreements provide, as do the standard restricted stock and option agreements used by the Company for its compensation programs, that upon a termination without cause the executive's restricted stock and options will vest.

The standard restricted stock and option agreements used by the Company in its compensation program provide that upon an employee's termination without cause or the employee's Retirement (as defined in the agreement), all outstanding stock options and restricted shares of stock held by the employee will vest, and the employee will have up to


months to exercise any options then held. Under the agreements, Retirement generally means a termination of employment and other business relationships, other than for cause, after attainment of age


, provided that (i) the employee has worked for the Company for at least


years, (ii) the employee's age at Retirement plus years of employment with the Company equals at least


, (iii) the employee provides at least

six

months written notice of his intent to retire, and (iv) the employee enters into a

one

year non-compete and employee non-solicitation agreement.

The Company also has an Officer Severance Program (the "Program"), which applies only in connection with a sale of the Company for the benefit of those officers of the Company who do not have employment agreements. Under the Program, in the event an officer who is not otherwise covered by a severance arrangement is terminated (other than for cause), or the officer chooses to terminate his or her employment for good reason (as defined), in either case within


months following a sale event (as defined) of the Company, such officer will generally receive a cash lump sum payment equal to a multiple of the officer's covered compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus). The multiple is

one

times for vice presidents and senior vice presidents, and

two

times for executive vice presidents. The officer's restricted stock and options would also vest. Costs related to the Company's employment agreements and the Program are deferred and recognized over the requisite service period when considered by management to be probable and estimable.

Legal Contingencies

The Company accounts for recoveries from legal matters as a reduction in the legal and related costs incurred associated with the matter, with recoveries in excess of these costs reported as a gain or, where appropriate, a reduction in the basis of a community to which the suit related. During the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company received

$1,933,000

and

$775,000

, respectively, in legal recoveries. There were

no

material receipts during the year ended December 31,


.

See Note 14, "Subsequent Events," for a discussion of the Edgewater fire that occurred in January 2015 and related lawsuits and contingencies. In addition, the Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by insurance. If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. While the resolution of these other matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management currently believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company. In instances where the Company has a gain contingency associated with legal proceedings, the Company records a gain in the financial statements, to the extent of a loss recovery, when it is deemed probable to occur, can be reasonably estimated and is considered to be collectible.

Lease Obligations

The Company owns


apartment communities,

two

communities under development and

two

commercial properties, which are located on land subject to land leases expiring between October 2026 and March 2142, of which


are accounted for as operating leases recognizing rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. These leases have varying escalation terms, and

four

of these leases have purchase options exercisable through 2095. The Company incurred costs of

$21,664,000

,

$17,996,000

and

$17,604,000

in the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively, related to operating leases.

One

Development Community and

one

apartment community that completed construction during 2014 are located on land subject to a land lease, which are accounted for as capital leases, with a lease obligation of

$34,268,000

reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities. Each of these leases have options for the Company to purchase the land at some point during the lease terms which expire in 2046 and 2086.

Segment Reporting

The Company's reportable operating segments include Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities and Development/Redevelopment Communities. Annually as of January 1

st

, the Company determines which of its communities fall into each of these categories and generally maintains that classification throughout the year for the purpose of reporting segment operations, unless disposition or redevelopment plans regarding a community change.

•

Established Communities (also known as Same Store Communities) are consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year period is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year period. The Established Communities for the year ended

December 31, 2014

, are communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1,


, are not conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or planned for disposition within the current year period. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of

95%

physical occupancy or (ii) the

one

-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities includes all other completed communities that have stabilized occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not include communities that are conducting or planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year. Other Stabilized Communities for the year ended

December 31, 2014

include the stabilized operating communities acquired as part of the Archstone Acquisition.

•

Development/Redevelopment Communities consists of communities that are under construction and have not received a certificate of occupancy for the entire community, and where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year and communities under lease-up that had not reached stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January 1,


.

In addition, the Company owns land for future development and has other corporate assets that are not allocated to an operating segment.

The Company's segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing each segment's performance. The Company's chief operating decision maker is comprised of several members of its executive management team who use net operating income ("NOI") as the primary financial measure for Established Communities and Other Stabilized Communities. NOI is defined by the Company as total revenue less direct property operating expenses. Although the Company considers NOI a useful measure of a community's or communities' operating performance, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI excludes a number of income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of NOI to net income.

A reconciliation of NOI to net income for years ended

The following is a summary of NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale, not classified as discontinued operations, for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

The primary performance measure for communities under development or redevelopment depends on the stage of completion. While under development, management monitors actual construction costs against budgeted costs as well as lease-up pace and rent levels compared to budget.

The following table provides details of the Company's segment information as of the dates specified (dollars in thousands). The segments are classified based on the individual community's status as of the beginning of the given calendar year. Therefore, each year the composition of communities within each business segment is adjusted. Accordingly, the amounts between years are not directly comparable.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has a stock incentive plan, the 2009 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2009 Plan"). The 2009 Plan includes an authorization to issue shares of the Company's common stock, par value

$0.01

per share. At

December 31, 2014

, the Company has

1,673,193

shares remaining available to issue under the 2009 Plan, exclusive of shares that may be issued to satisfy currently outstanding awards such as stock options or performance awards. In addition, any awards that were outstanding under the Company's1994 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "1994 Plan") on May 21, 2009, the date the Company adopted the 2009 Plan, that are subsequently forfeited, canceled, surrendered or terminated (other than by exercise) will become available for awards under the 2009 Plan. The 2009 Plan provides for various types of equity awards to associates, officers, non-employee directors and other key personnel of the Company and its subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under the 2009 Plan include restricted and deferred stock, stock options that qualify as incentive stock options ("ISOs") under Section 422 of the Code, non-qualified stock options and stock appreciation rights. The 2009 Plan will expire on May 21, 2019.

Information with respect to stock options granted under the 2009 and 1994 Plans is as follows:

The following summarizes the exercise prices and contractual lives of options outstanding as of

December 31, 2014

:

Options outstanding under the 2009 and 1994 Plans at

December 31, 2014

had an intrinsic value of

$13,849,000

and

$15,915,000

, respectively. Options exercisable under the 2009 and 1994 Plans at

December 31, 2014

had an intrinsic value of

$8,647,000

and

$15,915,000

, respectively. Options exercisable under the 2009 and 1994 Plans had a weighted average contractual life of

7.3

years and

2.5

years, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised during


,


and


was

$20,028,000

,

$2,395,000

and

$26,746,000

, respectively.

The cost related to stock-based employee compensation for employee stock options included in the determination of net income is based on estimated forfeitures for the given year. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures at the end of the vesting period. The following table summarizes the weighted average fair value of employee stock options for 2013 and 2012 and the associated assumptions used to calculate the value. There were no stock options granted in 2014.

During 2013, the Company adopted a revised compensation framework under which share-based compensation will be granted, composed of annual awards and multiyear long term incentive performance awards. Annual awards will include restricted stock awards for which one third of the award will vest annually over a three year period following the measurement period. Under the multiyear long term incentive component of the revised framework, the Company will grant a target number of restricted stock units, with the ultimate award determined by the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock and/or operating performance metrics, measured in each case over a measurement period of up to

three

years. The share-based compensation earned will be in the form of restricted stock, or upon election of the recipient, up to

25%

in the form of stock options, for which one third of the award will vest annually over a

three

year period following the measurement period.

The Company granted

131,980

restricted stock units net of forfeitures, with an estimated aggregate compensation cost of

$15,522,000

, as part of its stock-based compensation plan during the year ended

December 31, 2014

.  The amount of restricted stock ultimately earned is based on the total shareholder return metrics related to the Company’s common stock for

58,206

restricted stock units and financial metrics related to operating performance and leverage metrics of the Company for

73,774

restricted stock units.  For the portion of the grant for which the award is determined by the total shareholder return of the Company’s common stock, the Company used a Monte Carlo model to assess the compensation cost associated with the restricted stock units.  The estimated compensation cost was derived using the following assumptions: baseline share value of

$128.97

; dividend yield of approximately

3.6%

; estimated volatility figures ranging from

17.6%

to

18.6%

over the life of the plan for the Company using

50%

historical volatility and

50%

implied volatility; and risk free rates over the life of the plan ranging from

0.04%

to

0.72%

; resulting in an average estimated fair value per restricted stock unit of

$103.20

. For the portion of the grant for which the award is determined by financial metrics, the estimated compensation cost was based on the baseline share value of

$128.97

and the Company's estimate of corporate achievement for the financial metrics.

During the year ended

December 31, 2014

, the Company also issued

115,163

shares of restricted stock, of which

16,209

shares related to the conversion of restricted stock units to restricted shares, and the remaining

98,954

shares were new grants with a fair value of

$12,799,000

. The compensation cost was based on the share price at the grant date.

F-31


At

December 31, 2014

and


, the Company had

190,240

and

182,083

, respectively, outstanding unvested restricted shares granted under restricted stock awards. Restricted stock vesting during the year ended

December 31, 2014

totaled

99,036

shares, of which

5,073

shares related to the conversion of restricted stock units and

93,963

shares related to restricted stock awards, which had fair values at the grant date ranging from

$74.20

to

$163.39

per share. The total fair value of shares vested under restricted stock awards was

$11,352,000

$14,832,000

and

$36,337,000

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and

$17,775,000

and

$9,961,000

for the years ended

,

$8,379,000

and

$5,140,000

for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. At

December 31, 2014

, there was a total unrecognized compensation cost of

$1,058,000

for unvested stock options and

$19,559,000

for unvested restricted stock and restricted stock units, which does not include estimated forfeitures. The unrecognized compensation cost for unvested stock options and restricted stock and restricted stock units is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.1

and

3.6

years, respectively.

The Company estimates the forfeiture of stock options and recognizes compensation cost net of the estimated forfeitures. The estimated forfeitures included in compensation cost are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures at the end of the vesting period. The forfeiture rate at

December 31, 2014

was

1.4%

. The application of estimated forfeitures did not materially impact compensation expense for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In October 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the "ESPP"). Initially

1,000,000

shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. There are currently

714,827

shares remaining available for issuance under the ESPP. Full-time employees of the Company generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if, as of the last day of the applicable election period, they have been employed by the Company for at least

one

month. All other employees of the Company are eligible to participate provided that, as of the applicable election period, they have been employed by the Company for


months. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are permitted to acquire shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions, subject to maximum purchase limitations. During 2013, the purchase period was a period of

seven

months beginning April 1 and ending October 30. The Company modified the ESPP beginning in 2014, establishing

two

purchase periods of approximately

six

months each. The first purchase period begins January 1 and ends June 10, and the second purchase period begins July 1 and ends December 10. The purchase price for common stock purchased under the plan is

85%

of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first day of the applicable purchase period or the last day of the applicable purchase period. The offering dates, purchase dates and duration of purchase periods may be changed, if the change is announced prior to the beginning of the affected date or purchase period. The Company issued

9,848

,

9,260

and

6,260

shares and recognized compensation expense of

$407,000

,

$174,000

and

$127,000

under the ESPP for the years ended

December 31, 2014

,


and


, respectively. The Company accounts for transactions under the ESPP using the fair value method prescribed by accounting guidance applicable to entities that use employee share purchase plans.

Directors of the Company who are also employees receive no additional compensation for their services as a director. Following each annual meeting of stockholders, non-employee directors receive (i) a number of shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock awards) having a value of

$125,000

and (ii) a cash payment of

$60,000

, payable in quarterly installments of

$15,000

. The number of shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock awards) is calculated based on the closing price on the day of the award. Non-employee directors may elect to receive all or a portion of cash payments in the form of a deferred stock award. In addition, beginning in May 2014, the Lead Independent Director receives an annual fee of

$25,000

Fair Value

Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value

Derivative Financial Instruments

Currently, the Company uses interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate risk. These instruments are carried at fair value in the Company's financial statements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of counterparty nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of its net position with a given counterparty, as well as any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major, creditworthy financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. As part of its on-going control procedures, the Company monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and the exposure of the Company to any single entity, thus reducing credit risk concentration. The Company believes the likelihood of realizing losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives use Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. As of

December 31, 2014

, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined it is not significant. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Hedge ineffectiveness did not have a material impact on earnings of the Company for


or any prior period, and the Company does not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the future.

The following table summarizes the consolidated Hedging Derivatives at

December 31, 2014

, excluding derivatives executed to hedge debt on communities classified as held for sale (dollars in thousands):

Excluding derivatives executed to hedge secured debt on communities classified as held for sale, the Company had

four

derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and


derivatives not designated as hedges at

December 31, 2014

. Fair value changes for derivatives not in qualifying hedge relationships for the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, were not material. Excluding the forward interest rate protection agreement discussed further below, fair value changes for derivatives not in qualifying hedge relationships for the year ended

December 31, 2013

were not material. To adjust the Hedging Derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedges to their fair value and recognize the impact of hedge accounting, the Company recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$6,116,000

and

$5,892,000

during the years ended

December 31, 2014

and


, respectively, and recorded an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss of

$20,987,000

during the year ended

December 31, 2012

. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company reclassified

$59,376,000

of deferred losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss with

$51,000,000

recognized as loss on interest rate contract as discussed below, and the balance recorded as a component of interest expense, net. The Company anticipates reclassifying approximately

$5,493,000

of hedging losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings within the next 12 months to offset the variability of cash flows of the hedged item during this period. The Company did not have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges as of

December 31, 2014

and


.

In 2013, the Company was party to a

$215,000,000

forward interest rate protection agreement, which was entered into in 2011 to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of its expected debt issuance activity in 2013. The Company settled this position at its maturity in May 2013 with a payment to the counterparty of

$51,000,000

, the fair value at the time of settlement. Based on changes in the Company's capital requirements for 2013, the Company deemed it was probable that it would not issue the anticipated debt for which the interest rate protection agreement was transacted. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company recognized a loss of

$51,000,000

for the forward interest rate protection agreement in loss on interest rate contract on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

The Company provided redemption options (the "Puts") that allow joint venture partners of the Company to require the Company to purchase their interests in the investment at a guaranteed minimum amount related to

three

ventures. The Puts are payable in cash. The Company determines the fair value of the Puts based on unobservable inputs considering the assumptions that market participants would make in pricing the obligations, applying a guaranteed rate of return to the joint venture partners' net capital contribution balances as of period end. Given the significance of the unobservable inputs, the valuations are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company issued units of limited partnership interest in DownREITs which provide the DownREIT limited partners the ability to present all or some of their units for redemption for cash as determined by the partnership agreement. Under the DownREIT agreements, for each limited partnership unit, the limited partner is entitled to receive cash in the amount equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on or about the date of redemption. In lieu of cash redemption, the Company may elect to exchange such units for an equal number of shares of the Company's common stock. The limited partnership units in the DownREITs are valued using the market price of the Company's common stock, a Level 1 price under the fair value hierarchy.

Financial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalent balances are held with various financial institutions, within principal protected accounts. The Company monitors credit ratings of these financial institutions and the concentration of cash and cash equivalent balances with any one financial institution and believes the likelihood of realizing material losses related to cash and cash equivalent balances is remote. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at their face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values and are Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

Other Financial Instruments

Rents receivable, accounts and construction payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at their face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values.

The Company values its unsecured notes using quoted market prices, a Level 1 price within the fair value hierarchy. The Company values its notes payable and outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility and Term Loan using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each instrument. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the instrument, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The process also considers credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the Company’s nonperformance risk. The Company has concluded that the value of its notes payable and amounts outstanding under its Credit Facility and Term Loan are Level 2 prices as the majority of the inputs used to value its positions fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date on which this Form 10-K was filed, the date on which these financial statements were issued, and identified the items below for discussion.

In January 2015:

The Company sold Avalon on Stamford Harbor, located in Stamford, CT. Avalon on Stamford Harbor contains


homes and a working marina containing


boat slips and was sold for

$115,500,000

.

The Company acquired land for

$325,000,000

associated with

three

Development Rights located in New York, NY and Bellevue, WA. If developed as expected, the development rights related to this land will contain


apartment homes for a projected total capital cost of

$509,717,000

.

A fire occurred at the Company's Avalon at Edgewater apartment community located in Edgewater, New Jersey ("Edgewater"). Edgewater consisted of

two

residential buildings.

One

building, which contained


apartment homes, was destroyed and is uninhabitable. The second building, which contains


apartment homes, has been reoccupied and the Company currently believes it only suffered minimal damage. The Company is currently assessing its direct losses resulting from the fire, which could vary based on costs and time to rebuild, as well its liability to third parties who incurred damages on account of the fire. To date, a number of lawsuits on behalf of former residents have been filed against the Company, including

three

purported class actions. While the Company currently believes that its direct losses and its liability to third parties will be substantially covered by its insurance policies, including coverage for the replacement cost of the building, third party claims, and business interruption loss, subject to deductibles as well as a self-insured portion of the property insurance for which the Company is obligated for

12%

of the first

$50,000,000

in losses, the Company can give no assurances in this regard and continues to evaluate this matter. As of December 31, 2014, Edgewater was encumbered with a fixed-rate secured mortgage note with an effective interest rate of

5.95%

, and an outstanding principal balance of

$75,012,000

, due in May 2019 (the “Edgewater Mortgage”).  The Edgewater Mortgage stipulates that in the event of a casualty loss such as the Edgewater fire, the lender has absolute discretion to determine the disposition of the insurance proceeds, and can compel the Company (i) to direct the insurance proceeds to be used for the restoration of Edgewater, or (ii) to apply the insurance proceeds to repay the outstanding loan balance, at par.  As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Company is complying with all lender requirements and continues to work with the lender to resolve open issues related to the Edgewater Mortgage.

The Company received

$20,700,000

from the joint venture partner associated with MVP I, LLC, the entity that owns Avalon at Mission Bay North II, upon agreement with the partner to modify the joint venture agreement to eliminate the Company's promoted interest for future return calculations and associated distributions. Prospectively, earnings and distributions will be based on the Company's

25.0%

equity interest in the venture.
