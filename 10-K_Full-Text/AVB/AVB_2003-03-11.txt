PART I

This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Our actual results could differ materially from those
set forth in each forward-looking statement. Certain factors that might cause
such a difference are discussed in this report, including in the section
entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 37 of this Form 10-K.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate
investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. We focus on the
ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities (which generally
command among the highest rents in their submarkets) in high barrier-to-entry
markets of the United States. This is because we believe that, long term, the
limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability
in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to
other markets over an entire business cycle. These barriers-to-entry generally
include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions
and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land (“in-fill
locations”) is in limited supply. Our markets are located in the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California
regions of the United States. We believe that we have penetrated substantially
all of the high barrier-to-entry markets of the country.

At February 1, 2003, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest
in 137 operating apartment communities containing 40,179 apartment homes in
eleven states and the District of Columbia, of which two communities containing
1,089 apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned or held
a direct or indirect ownership interest in 12 communities under construction
that are expected to contain an aggregate of 3,429 apartment homes when
completed. We also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to
develop an additional 38 communities that, if developed in the manner expected,
will contain an estimated 9,950 apartment homes. We generally obtain ownership
in an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by
acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community. In
selecting sites for development, redevelopment or acquisition, we favor
locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to
recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.

Our real estate investments consist of Established Communities, Other
Stabilized Communities, Development Communities and Redevelopment Communities.
A description of these segments and other related information can be found in
Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth
in Item 8 of this report.

Our principal operating objectives are to develop, own and operate, in our
selected markets, high-quality, upscale communities that contain features and
amenities desired by prospective residents, and to provide our residents with
efficient and effective service. Our principal financial goals are to
successfully implement those operating objectives in a cost effective manner
and thereby increase long-term stockholder value by increasing operating cash
flow and Funds from Operations (as defined by the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts). For a description of the meaning of Funds from
Operations and its use and limitation as an operating measure, see the
discussion titled “Funds from Operations” in Item 7 of this report. Our
strategies to achieve these objectives and goals include:

•

generating consistent, sustained earnings growth at each
community through increased revenue, by balancing high occupancy
with premium pricing, and increased operating margins from operating
expense management;

•

investing selectively in new development, redevelopment and
acquisition communities in markets with growing or high potential
for demand and high barriers-to-entry;

•

selling communities in markets where we seek to reduce our
presence or where value creation has been optimized; and

•

maintaining a conservative capital structure to provide
continuous access to cost-effective capital.


We believe that we can generally implement these strategies best by developing,
redeveloping, acquiring and managing upscale assets in high barrier-to-entry
markets while maintaining the financial discipline to ensure balance
sheet flexibility.

Development Strategy.

We carefully select land for development and follow
established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of
development. As one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment
communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States, we identify
development opportunities through local market presence and access to local
market information achieved through our regional offices. In addition to our
principal executive offices in Alexandria, Virginia, we also maintain regional
offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following
cities:

After selecting a target site, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire
the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options
and long-term conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target
site shortly before the start of construction, which reduces
development-related risks as well as preserves capital. After we acquire land,
we generally shift our focus to construction. Except for certain mid-rise and
high-rise apartment communities where we may elect to use third-party general
contractors or construction managers, we act as our own general contractor and
construction manager. We believe this enables us to achieve higher construction
quality, greater control over construction schedules and significant cost
savings. Our development, property management and construction teams monitor
construction progress to ensure high-quality workmanship and a smooth and
timely transition into the leasing and operational phase.

Redevelopment Strategy.

When we undertake the redevelopment of a community,
our goal is to generally renovate and/or rebuild an existing community so that
our total investment is significantly below replacement cost and the community
is the highest quality apartment community or best rental value for an upscale
apartment community in its local area. We have established procedures to
minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment. Our redevelopment teams,
which include key redevelopment, construction and property management
personnel, monitor redevelopment progress. We believe we achieve significant
cost savings by acting as our own general contractor. More importantly, this
helps to ensure high-quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely
transition into the lease-up and restabilization phase.

Disposition Strategy.

To optimize our concentration of communities in selected
high barrier-to-entry markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term
investment criteria when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the
proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities under
construction or reconstruction. This disposition strategy acts as a source of
capital because we are able to redeploy the net proceeds from our dispositions
in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally by issuing debt or equity
securities. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing
bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales
price and tax ramifications of each proposal. In connection with this
disposition strategy, we have disposed of one community since January 1, 2002.
The net proceeds from the sale of this community were approximately
$78,454,000. We expect to increase our disposition activity during 2003 in
response to current and anticipated real estate and capital markets conditions.
However, we cannot assure you that assets can be sold on terms that we
consider satisfactory, or at all, or that market conditions will continue to
make the sale of assets an appealing strategy.

Acquisition Strategy.

Our core competencies in development and redevelopment
discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target.
Between January 1, 2002 and February 1, 2003, we acquired two


communities
containing 706 apartment homes, one of which was acquired in connection with a
forward purchase contract agreed to in 1997. The acquisition of these
communities was designed to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are
generally supply constrained and in which we desired an increased presence.

Property Management Strategy.

We intend to increase operating income through
innovative, proactive property management that will result in higher revenue
from communities and controlled operating expenses.

Our principal strategies to maximize revenue include:

Controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase
earnings growth. Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue
allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue,
thereby increasing operating margins. We aggressively pursue real estate tax
appeals and control operating expenses as follows:

On-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net
operating income produced at their respective communities. We are also
pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue sources.

Technology Strategy.

We believe that an innovative management information
system infrastructure is an important element in managing our future growth.
This is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident
profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing
decisions and financial management.

We currently have investments in three technology companies. These investments were made
with the belief that they would promote the development and application of
technology and services which would improve the operating performance of our
real estate holdings. Historically, our most significant technology investment
has been Realeum, Inc., (“Realeum”), an entity engaged in the development and
deployment of an on-site property management and leasing automation system that
enables management to capture, review and analyze data to a greater extent than
is possible using existing commercial software. To help monitor this
investment, Thomas J. Sargeant, our Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, is a director of Realeum. After consideration of our share
of Realeum’s losses, the carrying value of our investment in Realeum has been
reduced to zero as of December 31, 2002. We are also a member of Constellation
Real Technologies LLC, (“Constellation”), an entity formed by a number of real
estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of
investing in multi-sector real estate technology opportunities. Our original
commitment to Constellation was $4,000,000 but, as a result of an agreement
among the members reducing the commitment due from each member, our commitment
is currently $2,600,000, of which we have contributed $959,000 to date. The
remaining unfunded commitment of $1,641,000 is expected to be funded over the
next five years. Our third investment is in Rent.com, an internet-based rental
housing information provider. The aggregate carrying value of our
technology investments at February 1,
2003 was $1,404,000.


Financing Strategy.

We have consistently maintained, and intend to continue to
maintain, a conservative capital structure. At December 31, 2002, our
debt-to-total market capitalization was 46.1%, and our permanent long-term
floating rate debt, not including borrowings under the unsecured credit
facility, was only 2.0% of total market capitalization. Market capitalization
reflects the aggregate of the market value of common stock, the liquidation
preference of preferred stock and the principal amount of debt.

Before planned construction or reconstruction activity begins, we intend to
arrange adequate capital sources to complete such undertakings, although we
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. During 2002,
substantially all of our construction and reconstruction activities were funded
by the issuance of unsecured debt securities, net proceeds from asset sales and
retained operating cash. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we
may have to abandon planned development activities, write-off associated
pursuit costs and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we
will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such
pursuits.

We estimate that a portion of our short-term liquidity needs will be met from
retained operating cash and borrowings under our $500,000,000 variable rate
unsecured credit facility. At February 28, 2003, $155,470,000 was outstanding,
$15,529,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $329,001,000 was
available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility.

If required to meet the balance of our liquidity needs, we will attempt to
arrange additional capacity under our existing unsecured credit facility, sell
additional existing communities or land and/or issue additional debt or equity
securities. While we believe we have the financial position to expand our
short-term credit capacity and access the capital markets as needed, we cannot
assure you that we will be successful in completing these arrangements, sales
or offerings. The failure to complete these transactions on a cost-effective
basis or at all could have a material adverse impact on our operating results
and financial condition, including the abandonment of development
pursuits.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which may
enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases. Such short-term leases generally minimize the risk to
us of the adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these leases
permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty and
therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rent. Our current
policy is generally to allow residents to terminate leases upon an agreed
advance written notice and a lease termination payment, as provided for in the
resident’s lease. Short-term leases combined with relatively consistent demand
have allowed rents, and therefore cash flow from the portfolio, to provide an
attractive inflation hedge. However, in a deflationary rent environment as is
currently being experienced, we are exposed to declining rents more quickly
under these shorter-term leases.

Tax Matters

We filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as
a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and intend to
maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with
limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income
tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is
distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to
avoid income tax at the corporate level.

Environmental and Related Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and
ordinances, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and
remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product
releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs
incurred by these parties as a result of the contamination. These damages and
costs may be substantial. The presence of such substances, or the failure to
properly remediate the contamination, may adversely affect the owner’s ability
to


borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. In addition, some
environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.

Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the
removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (“ACMs”)
when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of reconstruction,
remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. These laws may impose
liability for release of ACMs and may
provide for third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real
properties for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. We are not
aware that any ACMs were used in the construction of the communities we
developed. ACMs were, however, used in the construction of several of the
communities that we acquired. We have implemented an operations and maintenance
program for each of the communities at which ACMs have been detected. We do
not anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the
presence of ACMs at our communities.

We are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented
an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities. We do not
anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the
presence of lead paint at our communities.

All of our stabilized operating communities, and all of the communities that we
are currently developing or redeveloping, have been subjected to at least a
Phase I or similar environmental assessment, which generally does not involve
invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling. These assessments,
together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties, have not
revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that
we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets,
financial condition or results of operations. In connection with our ownership,
operation and development of communities, from time to time we undertake
remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other
contaminants. In some cases, an indemnity exists upon which we may be
able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination. There
can be no assurance, however, that all necessary remediation actions have been
or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full
or at all, in the event that environmental liability arises.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on
building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered
or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at
multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a
new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain
molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic
or other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the
importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us
when they see mold or excessive moisture. We have established procedures for
promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment
homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the
resident believe a health risk is presented. However, we cannot assure that
mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner.
If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be
required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the
mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other
liabilities.

Additionally, we have occasionally been involved in developing, managing,
leasing and operating various properties for third parties. Consequently, we
may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore,
potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs
which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances. We are not aware of any
material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or
developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties.


We cannot assure you that:

Other Information

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge in
the “Investor Relations” section of our website (www.avalonbay.com) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the
SEC.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1978. In
1995, we reincorporated in the State of Maryland and have been focused on the
ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time. As of
December 31, 2002, we had 1,775 employees.

ITEM 2. COMMUNITIES

Our real estate investments consist of current operating apartment
communities, communities in various stages of development, and land or land
options held for development. The following is a description of each
category:

Current Communities

are categorized as Established, Other
Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following
attributes:

•

Established Communities

(also known as Same
Store Communities) are communities where a comparison
of operating results from the prior year to the current
year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and
had stabilized occupancy and costs as of the beginning
of the prior year. We determine which of our
communities fall into the Established Communities
category annually as of January 1st of each year and
maintain that classification throughout the year. For
the year 2002, the Established Communities were
communities that had stabilized occupancy and costs as
of January 1, 2001 and are not conducting or planning
to conduct substantial redevelopment activities, as
described below, within the current year. We consider
a community to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier
of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the
one year anniversary of completion of development or
redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

are all other
completed communities that have stabilized occupancy
and are not conducting or planning redevelopment
activities. Other Stabilized Communities therefore
include communities that were either acquired or
achieved stabilization after January 1, 2001 and that
were not conducting or planning to start redevelopment
activities within the current year.

•

Lease-Up Communities

are communities where
construction has been complete for less than one year
and where occupancy has not reached 95%.

•

Redevelopment Communities

are communities
where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is
planned to begin during the current year.
Redevelopment is


considered
substantial when capital invested during the
reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of $5,000,000 or
10% of the community’s acquisition cost.

Development Communities

are communities that are under
construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has
not been received. These communities may be partially complete
and operating.

Development Rights

are development opportunities in the early
phase of the development process for which we either have an
option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for
which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to
purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We
capitalize all related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit
of these new developments.

As of December 31, 2002, our communities were classified as follows:

Our holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following
pages.


Current Communities

The Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities
consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The
Current Communities, as of February 1, 2003, include 106 garden-style, 17
high-rise and 14 mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities
offer many attractive amenities including some or all of the following:

Other features at various communities may include:

•

swimming pools;

•

fitness centers;

•

tennis courts; and

•

business centers.

We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all
communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance
and, where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the
aesthetic appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management
team focused on the specific needs of residents enhances market appeal to
discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher
rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and
operating expenses.


These Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:

We manage and operate all of the Current Communities. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, we completed construction of 2,521 apartment homes in ten
communities for a total cost of $466,600,000. The average age of the Current
Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment
homes, is 8.1 years.

Of the Current Communities, as of February 1, 2003, we own:


We also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the Development
Communities, a membership interest in a limited liability company that holds a
fee simple interest in a Development Community and a general partnership
interest in two partnerships structured as “DownREITs” that each own one
Development Community.

In each of the six partnerships structured as DownREITs, either we or one of
our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one or more
limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by units of
limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited partners
are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made
to the general partner. Although the partnership agreements for each of the
DownREITs are different, generally the distributions per unit paid to the
holders of units of limited partnership interests have approximated
our current
common stock dividend amount. Each DownREIT partnership has been
structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners will be entitled to a
distribution greater than the initial distribution provided for in the
applicable partnership agreement. The holders of units of limited partnership
interest have the right to present each unit of limited partnership interest
for redemption for cash equal to the fair market value of a share of our common
stock on the date of redemption. In lieu of cash, we may elect to acquire any
unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock. As of
February 1, 2003, there were 975,751 DownREIT partnership
units outstanding. The DownREIT
partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities

As of February 1, 2003, we had 12 Development Communities under construction.
We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of
3,429 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including
land acquisition costs, of approximately $645,700,000. Statements regarding
the future development or performance of the Development Communities are
forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will complete the Development Communities;

•

our budgeted costs or estimates of occupancy rates will be realized;

•

our schedule of leasing start dates, construction completion
dates or stabilization dates will be achieved; or

•

future developments will realize returns comparable to our
past developments.

You should carefully review the discussion under “Risks of Development and
Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this Item 2.


The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold
a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except
where noted.

Redevelopment Communities

As of February 1, 2003, we had two communities under redevelopment. We expect
the total budgeted cost to complete these communities, including the cost of
acquisition, capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment, to be approximately $197,800,000, of which
approximately $28,200,000 is the additional capital invested or expected to be
invested during redevelopment and $5,800,000 has been invested since
acquisition unrelated to redevelopment. Statements regarding the future
redevelopment or performance of the Redevelopment Communities are
forward-looking statements. We have found that the cost to redevelop an
existing apartment community is more difficult to budget and estimate than the
cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we expect that actual costs may
vary from our budget by a wider range than for a new development community. We
cannot assure you that we will meet our schedules for reconstruction completion
or restabilized operations, or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either
individually or in the aggregate. See the discussion under “Risks of
Development and Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this Item 2.

Development Rights

As of February 1, 2003, we are considering the development of 38 new apartment
communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a
leasehold interest, or for which we hold a purchase option. We generally hold
Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 11 of the
Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be
built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from
those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed
site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We
estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would
ultimately add 9,950 upscale apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially
all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the
communities we currently own. At December 31, 2002, there were cumulative net
capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead
costs, but excluding land costs) of $31,461,000 relating to Development Rights.
In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of Development Rights
(consisting of original land and additional carrying costs) of $78,688,000 are
reflected as land held for development on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets as of December 31, 2002. These land costs include $19,939,000
associated with two land parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to
development and were planned for disposition as of December 31, 2002.

The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the
due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of
the Development Rights to pursue, if any, or to continue to pursue once an
investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make
after we perform


financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed
with a Development Right, we generally would not recover capitalized costs
incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts
in connection with the sale of land; however we cannot guarantee a recovery.
To recognize the possibility of such loss, we recognize a charge to expense to
provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized pre-development
costs. The determination of a charge to expense relative to pursuits involves
management judgment regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed
to development. The amount charged to expense and reflected in operating
expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements related to
possible abandoned pursuits was $2,800,000 and $2,200,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Because we intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new
developments, other financing alternatives may be required to help finance the
development of those Development Rights scheduled to start construction after
January 1, 2003.

Although the development of any particular Development Right cannot be assured,
we believe that the Development Rights, in the aggregate, present attractive
potential opportunities for future development and growth of long-term
stockholder value.

Statements regarding the future development of the Development Rights are
forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary
governmental approvals or the financing required to develop these
communities, or that we will decide to develop any particular
community; or

•

if we undertake construction of any particular community,
that we will complete construction at the total budgeted cost
assumed in the financial projections in the following table.

Risks of Development and Redevelopment

We intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment
home communities. Our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed
to the following:

The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect our
ability to achieve our projected yields on communities under development or
redevelopment and could affect results of operations and our payment of
distributions to our stockholders.

Construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in
the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes
to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time. Although we
attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions, we cannot predict with
certainty what those changes will be. Construction costs have been increasing
and, for some of our Development Communities, the total construction costs have
been or are expected to be higher than the original budget. Total budgeted
cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the
respective Development or Redevelopment Community, determined in accordance
with GAAP, including:

Costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases,
exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be
experienced in the future. We cannot assure you that market rents in effect at
the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete
lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased
construction or reconstruction costs.

Capitalized Interest

In accordance with GAAP, we capitalize interest expense during construction or
reconstruction until a building obtains a final certificate of occupancy.
Interest that is incurred thereafter and allocated to a completed apartment


home within the community is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 totaled $29,937,000 and $27,635,000,
respectively.

Acquisition Activities and Other Recent Developments

Acquisitions of Existing Communities.

During the year ended December 31, 2002,
we acquired two communities. The Promenade, located in Burbank, California,
contains 400 apartment homes and was acquired for a total price of $70,300,000,
which includes the assumption of $33,900,000 of floating-rate, tax-exempt debt.
Avalon Greyrock, located in Stamford, Connecticut, contains 306 apartment
homes and was acquired pursuant to a forward purchase contract agreed to in
1997 with an unaffiliated third party for a total acquisition cost of
approximately $69,900,000.

One DownREIT partnership was formed since January 1, 2002 in conjunction with
the acquisition of land by that partnership.

Sales of Existing Communities.

We seek to increase our geographical
concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we
can:

•

apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;

•

reduce operating expenses; and

•

leverage management talent.

To achieve this increased concentration, we sell assets that do not meet our
long term investment criteria and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to
develop and redevelop communities. Pending such redeployment, we will
generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts
outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility. On occasion, we
will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow
account to facilitate a nontaxable, like-kind exchange transaction. We sold
one community, totaling 277 apartment homes, since January 1, 2002. Net
proceeds from the sale of this asset were $78,454,000.


Land Acquisitions and Leases for New Developments.

We carefully select land
for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both
the cost and the risks of development. During 2002, we acquired the following
land parcels which are currently held for future development:

Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses

We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with
respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance
policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles
that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of
losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full
or in part, because they are either uninsurable or are not economically
feasible. If an uninsured property loss or a property loss in excess of
insured limits were to occur, we could lose our capital invested in a
community, as well as the anticipated future revenues from such community. We
would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other
obligations related to the community. If an uninsured liability to a third
party were to occur, we would incur the cost of defense and settlement with, or
court ordered damages to, that third party. A significant uninsured property
or liability loss could materially and adversely affect our business and our
financial condition and results of operations.

We have noted that the insurance and reinsurance markets have worsened as
compared to the prior year, which we believe have resulted in higher insurance
costs for the entire real estate sector. Although we will continue to maintain
commercially reasonable insurance coverage, we believe that the cost of such
coverage will increase at a faster rate than other operating expenses.

Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of
active earthquake faults. A large concentration of our communities lie near,
and thus are susceptible to, the major fault lines in the San Francisco Bay
Area, including the San Andreas fault and Hayward fault. We cannot assure you
that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured
levels. In November 2002, we renewed our earthquake insurance. We have in
place with respect to communities located in California, for any single
occurrence and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per
building equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five
percent deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence.
Earthquake coverage outside of California is subject to a $100,000,000 limit,
except with respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is
$65,000,000. Our earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a
$100,000 deductible per occurrence. In


addition, up to an annual aggregate of
$2,000,000, the next $400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be
treated as an additional deductible.

Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was
renewed on August 1, 2002. Although the insurance coverage provided for in the
renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year, the level
of our deductible and premiums costs has increased. Including the costs we may
incur as a result of deductibles, we expect the cost related to these insurance
categories for the policy period from August 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003 to
increase approximately $1,200,000 as compared to the prior period.

Our property insurance, which includes the earthquake coverage as previously
described and builder’s risk, was renewed on November 1, 2002, with an increase
in the annual premium of approximately $1,100,000 over the prior period.

Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings,
there have been recent reports that apartment communities could become targets
of terrorism. In November 2002, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act (“TRIA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available. In
connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property
damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000, with the first $15,000,000 of
damage costs payable by us. Our general liability policy provides coverage
(subject to deductibles and insured limits) for liability to third parties that
result from terrorist acts at our communities. In connection with TRIA, we
purchased third party liability terrorism insurance for communities with
greater than 24 floors, which were previously excluded under our general
liability policy.

We cannot assure that we will have full coverage
under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third
parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of
exposure to mold at one of our communities. See discussion under
“Environmental Matters” included in Item 1 of this report.

In March 2003, we expect to renew our directors and officers insurance (“D&O”).
In the past year, the D&O market has experienced increased and high profile
claim activity. We estimate that our costs for this insurance will increase
approximately 80% at renewal.

Americans with Disabilities Act

The apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire
must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the extent
that such properties are “public accommodations” and/or “commercial facilities”
as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act requirements could require removal of
structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our
properties where such removal is readily achievable. The Americans with
Disabilities Act does not, however, consider residential properties, such as
apartment communities, to be public accommodations or commercial facilities,
except to the extent portions of such facilities, such as leasing offices, are
open to the public. We believe our properties comply in all material respects
with all present requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act and
applicable state laws. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an
award of damages to private litigants.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims and
proceedings are expected to be covered by liability insurance. The following
matter, for


which we believe we have meritorious defenses and are therefore
vigorously defending against, is not covered by liability insurance. However,
outstanding litigation matters, individually and in the aggregate, including
the matter described below, are not expected to have a material adverse effect
on our business or financial condition.

We are currently involved in litigation with York Hunter Construction, Inc. and
National Union Fire Insurance Company. The action arises from our October 1999
termination of York Hunter as construction manager under a contract relating to
construction of the Avalon Willow community in Mamaroneck, New York, because of
alleged failures and deficiencies by York Hunter and its subcontractors in
performing under the contract. York Hunter initiated the litigation in October
1999 by filing a complaint against us and other defendants claiming more than
$15,000,000 in damages. We have filed counterclaims against York Hunter
seeking more than $9,000,000 in compensatory damages, including lost rental
income and costs to complete the community. We have also filed a claim against
National Union Fire Insurance, which furnished construction and performance
bonds to us on behalf of York Hunter. We believe that we have meritorious
defenses against all of York Hunter’s claims and are vigorously contesting
those claims. We also intend to pursue our counterclaims against York Hunter
and National Union Fire Insurance aggressively. The litigation is pending in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Westchester. A trial
date has been set for April 2003.

ITEM 4.    SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF STOCKHOLDERS

No matter was submitted to a vote of our security holders during the fourth
quarter of 2002.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the
Pacific Exchange (PCX) under the ticker symbol AVB. The following table sets
forth the quarterly high and low sales prices per share of our common stock on
the NYSE for the years 2002 and 2001, as reported by the NYSE. On February 1,
2003 there were 795 holders of record of an aggregate of 68,149,232 shares of
our outstanding common stock. The number of holders does not include
individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held
of record by a broker or clearing agency, but does include each such broker or
clearing agency as one recordholder.

We expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.
However, dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the
Board of Directors and will depend on actual cash from operations, our
financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution
requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and
other factors as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. The Board
of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.

Notes to Selected Financial Data

(1)

Gross EBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization, non-recurring items, gain on sale of
communities, impairment loss on planned dispositions and extraordinary items. Gross EBITDA is relevant to an
understanding of the economics of AvalonBay because it is one indication
of cash flow available from continuing operations to service fixed
obligations. Gross EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to
operating income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or “GAAP”), as an indicator of our operating
performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (as determined in
accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity. Our calculation of gross
EBITDA may not be comparable to gross EBITDA as calculated by other
companies.

(2)

We generally consider Funds from Operations, or FFO, to be an appropriate
measure of our operating performance because it helps investors understand
our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures.
We believe that to gain a clear understanding of our operating results,
FFO should be examined with net income as presented in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations included elsewhere in this report. Consistent
with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts

®

, we calculate FFO as:

•

net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, except
that excluded from net income or loss are gains or losses on sales
of property (including any impairment loss on planned dispositions)
and extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP);

•

plus depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.


FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance
with GAAP. Therefore it should not be considered as an alternative to net
income as an indication of performance. FFO should also not be considered an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP,
or as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of
cash available to fund cash needs. Further, FFO as calculated by other REITs
may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO. Calculations for FFO are
presented below:

Current Communities consist of all communities other than those which are
still under construction and have not received a final certificate of
occupancy.

Business Description and Community Information

We are a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate
investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. We focus on the
ownership and operation of upscale apartment communities (which generally
command among the highest rents in their submarkets) in high barrier-to-entry
markets of the United States. This is because we believe that, long term, the
limited new supply of upscale apartment homes and lower housing affordability
in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows relative to
other markets over an entire business cycle. However, we are in a
period of a business cycle where rents are resetting to lower levels, resulting in a decline in cash flows in 2002 compared to 2001. These
barriers-to-entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process
with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and
entitled land (“in-fill locations”) is in limited supply. Our markets are
located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and
Northern and Southern California regions of the United States.

We are a fully-integrated real estate organization with in-house expertise in
the following areas:

We believe apartment communities present an attractive long-term investment
opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential
resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a real estate
cycle. We intend to pursue real estate investments in markets where
constraints to new supply exist and where new household formations are expected
to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate
cycle. A number of our markets are experiencing economic contraction due to
continuing job losses, particularly in the technology, telecom and financial
services sectors. We expect these conditions to continue for most of 2003.

Although we believe we are well-positioned to continue to pursue opportunities
to develop and acquire upscale apartment homes based on our in-house
capabilities and expertise, we expect to decrease acquisition and development
activity during 2003 as compared to prior years and plan to increase
disposition activity. The level of disposition, acquisition or development
volume is heavily influenced by capital market conditions, including prevailing
interest rates. Given current capital market and real estate market
conditions, we are evaluating the appropriate allocation of capital investment
among development and redevelopment communities, the acquisition of existing
communities, and stock redemptions/repurchases. In addition, we expect to
increase disposition activity to realize a portion of the value created over
the past business cycle as well as to provide additional liquidity. See
“Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Future Financing and Capital Needs.”

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment
communities, communities in various stages of development, and development
rights (i.e., land or land options held for development). Our current
operating communities are further distinguished as Established, Other
Stabilized, Lease-Up and Redevelopment. A description of these categories and
operating performance information can be found in Note 9, “Segment Reporting,”
in our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.


On December 31, 2002, we owned or had an ownership interest in these categories
as follows:


Results of Operations and Funds From Operations

A comparison of our operating results for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 follows
(dollars in thousands):

Net income available to common stockholders

decreased $60,778,000 (28.1%) to
$155,722,000 in 2002. This decrease is primarily attributable to fewer gains
on sales of communities in 2002, coupled with a decline in net
operating income due to deteriorating market conditions in several of our
principal markets and increases in interest and depreciation expenses. Net
income available to common stockholders increased by $45,675,000 (26.7%) to
$216,500,000 in 2001 due to additional net operating income from
newly developed and redeveloped communities, as well as growth in net
operating income from Established Communities and increased gain on sale of
communities.


Net operating income

(“NOI”) is calculated at the community level and
represents total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including
property taxes, and excludes property management and other indirect operating expenses,
interest expense, depreciation expense, general and administrative expense and
impairment losses. We believe that NOI is an appropriate supplemental measure
of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand the
recurring operations of our real estate portfolio, as well as provide insight
into how management evaluates operations on a segment basis. NOI does not
represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Therefore, it should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.
NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from
operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity.
Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash
needs. A calculation of NOI, along with a reconciliation to net income, is
provided in the preceding table.

The NOI decrease of $17,249,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the
increase of $48,305,000 for the year ended December 31, 2001 as compared to the
prior years consist of changes in the following categories:

The NOI decrease in Established Communities in 2002 was largely due to the
effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets. Strong single
family home sales, partially fueled by a low mortgage rate environment, in
addition to continuing job losses in many of our submarkets, have aggravated a
weak demand environment, causing market rental rates and occupancies to
decline. We currently expect to continue to experience weak demand during most
of 2003. We also anticipate that any growth or improvement that we may
experience in late 2003 will be at a slower rate than that experienced by the
overall market and economy, if any, due to the types of industries (technology,
telecom, financial services) that make up a large proportion of the jobs in our
markets.

Rental income

increased due to rental income generated from acquired and newly
developed communities offset by a decline in occupancies and effective rental
rates for Established Communities.

Overall Portfolio – The weighted average number of occupied apartment
homes increased to 34,888 apartment homes for 2002 compared to 34,417
apartment homes for 2001 and 33,976 in 2000. This change in 2002 is
primarily the result of increased homes available from acquired and
newly developed communities, offset by occupancy declines related to the
weakened demand in certain of our submarkets. The weighted average
monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,522 in 2002
compared to $1,543 in 2001 and $1,402 in 2000.

Established Communities – Rental revenue decreased $30,679,000 (6.1%) in
2002 and increased by $26,268,000 (6.6%) in 2001. The decrease in 2002
is due to both declining effective rental rates and declining economic
occupancy. The increase in 2001 is due to market conditions during the
year that allowed for higher average rents partially offset by lower
economic occupancy. For 2002, the weighted average monthly revenue per
occupied apartment home decreased (4.1%) to $1,511 compared to $1,576
for 2001, partially due to increased concessions granted in 2002. The
average economic occupancy decreased from 95.5% in 2001 to 93.5% for
2002. Economic


occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment
homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different
economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue. Economic occupancy is
defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss as a percentage of
gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by
valuing occupied homes at contract rates and vacant homes at market
rents.

Although most of our markets have experienced weak demand, we have observed the
most significant declines in average rental rates and occupancy during 2002 in
certain Northern California and Northeast submarkets. Northern California,
which accounts for approximately 32.0% of current Established Community rental
revenue, experienced a decline in rental revenue in 2002, partially related to
job losses in the technology sector. Although economic occupancy remained flat
in Northern California in 2002 as compared to 2001, average rental rates
dropped 12.6% from $1,788 to $1,562 for those same periods.

The Northeast region also accounts for approximately 32.0% of current
Established Community rental revenue and has been experiencing a decline in
rental revenue, primarily the result of job losses in the financial services
sector. Economic occupancy decreased in the Northeast, from 96.9% in 2001 to
92.6% for 2002, while average rental rates improved slightly during 2002.

Other income

increased primarily due to the recognition of $5,800,000 and
$2,500,000 in 2002 and 2001, respectively, of business interruption insurance
related to the settlement of a fire insurance claim that occurred during the
construction of Avalon at Edgewater. In addition, we recognized $711,000 in
the first quarter of 2002 in construction management fees in connection with
the redevelopment of a community owned by a limited liability company in which
we have a membership interest.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes

increased due to
the addition of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment homes
coupled with increased insurance, marketing and bad debt. Insurance expense
has increased over the past two years, particularly during 2001 as the
insurance and reinsurance markets deteriorated, resulting in higher insurance
costs for the entire real estate sector. We renewed our general liability
policy on August 1, 2002 and our property coverage on November 1, 2002. See
“Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses” for a discussion of our insurance
policies and related coverage. Insurance and other costs associated with
Development and Redevelopment Communities are expensed as communities move from
the initial construction and lease-up phase to the stabilized operating phase.
Marketing initiatives have been expanded in response to the weak demand, and
bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of continuing job losses and
the weakened economy.

For Established Communities,
direct property operating expenses, excluding property
taxes, increased $5,579,000 (6.1%) to
$97,082,000 due to the increases in insurance, marketing and
bad debt expenses discussed above. During 2001, operating expenses
increased $3,559,000 (4.8%) due to increases in insurance, utilities,
marketing and office and administration expenses.

Property taxes

increased due to higher assessments and the addition of
newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes. Property taxes on
Development and Redevelopment Communities are capitalized while the
community is under construction. We begin to expense these costs as homes
within the community receive a final certificate of occupancy.

For Established Communities, the increases in property taxes in 2002 and
2001 of $550,000 and $969,000, respectively, were primarily due to
higher assessments throughout all regions.

Property management and other indirect operating expenses

decreased in 2002 and increased in
2001 as a result of executive separation costs that were recognized in 2001 but
not in 2002 or 2000. The decrease in 2002 is partially offset by increases in
unallocated central marketing costs and abandoned pursuit costs. Similar to
the community level, central marketing initiatives have been expanded in
response to the weak demand. Abandoned pursuit costs increased $600,000 from $2,200,000 in 2001 to $2,800,000 in 2002
related to development rights which may not be developed as
planned.


Interest expense

increased in 2002 due to the issuance of $750,000,000 of
unsecured notes between September 2001 and December 2002, partially offset by
the repayment of $100,000,000 of unsecured notes in September 2002 and overall
lower interest rates on both short-term and long-term borrowings. In addition,
higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility resulted
in higher interest expense between years. Interest expense increased in 2001
due to the issuance of $650,000,000 of unsecured notes during 2000 and 2001.

Depreciation expense

increased primarily related to acquisitions and completion
of development or redevelopment activities. We expect depreciation expense to
continue to increase as we complete additional development and redevelopment
communities, partially offset by the elimination of depreciation of communities
that are sold or designated as held for sale during 2003

.

General and administrative expense

decreased in 2002 and increased in 2001 as a
result of additional compensation expense recognized in the fourth quarter of
2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive. Unfilled positions and lower incentive compensation also contributed to the
decrease in 2002.

Impairment loss

of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land
parcels that as of December 31, 2002 were determined not likely to proceed to
development and therefore were planned for disposition. This loss was recorded
to reflect the parcels at fair market value (based on their entitlement status
as of December 31, 2002), less estimated selling costs. In February 2003, we
won an appeal regarding the entitlement status of one of these parcels. If we
decide to continue with the planned disposition, this change in entitlement
status may increase the potential value of the land and therefore decrease the
previously estimated loss that would be recognized at the date of disposal.
However, we are currently reevaluating our plans for this parcel, which may
result in 2003 in the partial recovery of the impairment loss recognized in
2002, if we decide to hold the land for development.

Equity in income of unconsolidated entities

decreased during 2002 primarily due
to losses recorded for an investment in a technology company accounted for
under the equity method. During 2002 and 2001, we recorded losses of
$3,166,000 and $1,730,000, respectively, related to this investment, bringing
the carrying value of this investment to zero as of December 31, 2002. In
addition, a $934,000 valuation allowance was recorded during 2001 for an
investment in a different technology company which contributed to the decrease
in 2001 over the prior year period.

Interest income

during 2002 decreased due to lower average cash balances
invested and lower interest rates. The increase in interest income during 2001
resulted from higher average cash balances invested.

Gain on sale of communities

, including discontinued operations, of $48,893,000,
$62,852,000 and $40,779,000 were realized in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
These gains on the sale of communities are the result of our strategy to sell
communities that do not meet our long-term strategic objectives and redeploy
the proceeds to current Development and Redevelopment Communities. The amount
of gains realized depend on many factors, including the number of communities
sold, the size and carrying value of those communities, and the market
conditions in the local area. In 2003, we expect to increase our disposition
activity as compared to 2002.


Funds from Operations

We consider Funds from Operations (“FFO”) to be an appropriate supplemental
measure of our operating performance because it helps investors understand our
ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. We believe
that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with
net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other
Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report. Consistent with the
definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of
Real Estate Investment Trusts

®

, we calculate FFO as:

•

net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP,
except that excluded from net income or loss are gains or
losses on sales of property (including any impairment loss
on planned dispositions) and extraordinary gains or losses
(as defined by GAAP);

•

plus depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance
with GAAP. Therefore it should not be considered an alternative to net income
as an indication of our performance. FFO should also not be considered an
alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by
GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily
indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Further, FFO as calculated
by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO and a presentation of
GAAP based cash flow metrics (dollars in thousands):

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Community Improvements

Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize only
non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize improvements and upgrades only if
the item:

•

exceeds $15,000;

•

extends the useful life of the asset; and

•

is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident.


Under this policy, virtually all capitalized costs are non-recurring, as
recurring make-ready costs are expensed as incurred. Recurring make-ready costs
include the following:

•

carpet and appliance replacements;

•

floor coverings;

•

interior painting; and

•

other redecorating costs.

We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture,
only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds $2,500. We generally
expense purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes. For
Established and Other Stabilized Communities, we recorded non-revenue
generating capitalized expenditures of approximately $302 per apartment home in
2002 and $251 per apartment home in 2001. The average maintenance costs
charged to expense, including carpet and appliance replacements, related to
these communities was $1,224 per apartment home in 2002 and $1,196 in 2001. We
anticipate that capitalized costs per apartment home will gradually increase as
the average age of our communities increases. We expect expensed maintenance
costs to increase as the average age of our communities increases, and to
fluctuate with changes in turnover.

We have expanded our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere
in this report to include additional information on capital expenditures. For
the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the amounts capitalized (excluding
land costs) related to (i) acquisitions, development and redevelopment were
$457,851,000 and $401,359,000, respectively, (ii) revenue generating
expenditures, such as water sub-metering equipment and cable installations were
$697,000 and $1,675,000, respectively, and (iii) non-revenue generating
expenditures were $11,375,000 and $12,234,000, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity.

The primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations.
Operating cash flows have historically been determined by:

•

the number of apartment homes;

•

rental rates;

•

occupancy levels; and

•

our expenses with respect to these apartment homes.

The timing, source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities
and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets
environment, particularly to changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital
markets environment affect our plans for undertaking construction and
development as well as acquisition and disposition activity.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $13,357,000 at December 31, 2002, a decrease
of $59,633,000 for the year. The following discussion relates to changes in
cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented
in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in this report.

Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
to $308,109,000 in 2002 from $320,606,000 in 2001 primarily due to the
decline in operating income from Established Communities and the loss of
operating income from communities sold during 2002 and 2001, partially
offset by additional operating income from newly developed and redeveloped
communities.

Investing Activities – Net cash used in investing activities of $440,331,000 in
2002 related to investments in assets through development, redevelopment and
acquisition of apartment communities, partially offset by proceeds from the
sales of apartment communities.


During 2002, we invested $545,202,000 in the purchase and development of real
estate and capital expenditures.

•

We began the development of seven new communities. These
communities, if developed as expected, will contain a total of 1,987
apartment homes, and the total investment, including land acquisition
costs, is projected to be approximately $371,200,000. We also
completed the development of ten new communities containing a total of
2,521 apartment homes for a total investment, including land
acquisition cost, of $466,600,000.

•

We completed the redevelopment of two communities containing 1,116
apartment homes for a total investment in redevelopment (excluding
acquisition costs) of $44,200,000.

•

We acquired two communities containing 706 apartment homes for a
total investment of $140,200,000, including the assumption of
$33,900,000 in debt.

•

We had capital expenditures relating to current communities’ real
estate assets of $10,930,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures
of $1,142,000.

The development and redevelopment of communities involve risks that the
investment will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. See
“Risks of Development and Redevelopment” in Item 2 of this report for our
discussion of these and other risks inherent in developing or redeveloping
communities.

We sold one community during 2002, generating net proceeds of $78,454,000.
These proceeds are being used to develop and redevelop communities
currently under construction and reconstruction, as well as to repay and
redeem certain debt and equity securities, as discussed below.

Financing Activities – Net cash provided by financing activities totaled
$72,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to the
issuance of unsecured notes and an increase in borrowings under our
unsecured credit facility, partially offset by dividends paid, common stock
repurchases, and the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock. See Note
3, “Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility,” and Note 4,
“Stockholders’ Equity,” in our Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

We regularly review our short and long-term liquidity needs, the adequacy of
Funds from Operations, as defined above, and other expected liquidity sources
to meet these needs. We believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are
to fund:

We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash
flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and
borrowing capacity under the unsecured credit facility.

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and
long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we
anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be
repaid prior to maturity. On January 15, 2003, $50,000,000 in unsecured notes
matured and was paid, including the balance of accrued interest. During the
remainder of 2003, we have


$100,000,000 in maturing unsecured notes. If we do
not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness, it will be
necessary for us to refinance this debt. This refinancing may be accomplished
by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, additional debt financing
that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of
communities, draws on our credit facility or by additional equity offerings.
We also anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that
when a debt obligation matures, some or all of each maturity can be satisfied
from this retained cash. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet
our long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt
financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that
they will be on terms we consider satisfactory.

Capital Resources.

We intend to match the long-term nature of our real estate
assets with long-term cost-effective capital to the extent permitted by
prevailing market conditions. From January 1, 2000 through February 1, 2003,
we issued $1,100,000,000 of unsecured notes through public offerings. We
expect this source of capital, together with cash flow from operating
activities, dispositions, and other sources of capital, to remain available to
meet our capital needs, for the foreseeable future, although no assurance can
be provided that the debt capital markets will remain available or that such
debt will be available on attractive terms.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

Our unsecured revolving credit facility is furnished by a syndicate of banks
and provides up to $500,000,000 in short-term credit. Under the terms of the
credit facility, if we elect to increase the facility up to $650,000,000, and
one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to
provide the additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the
facility up to $650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can
prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective
to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend
additional funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual
facility fee of $750,000 in equal quarterly installments. The unsecured credit
facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity
schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per
annum (1.94% on February 28, 2003). Pricing could vary if there is a change in
rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in
rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05%
to 0.15%. A competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to
$400,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium
to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing
provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may
result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. Pricing under the
competitive bid option resulted in average pricing of LIBOR plus 0.34% for
amounts most recently borrowed under the competitive bid option. The existing
facility matures in May 2005 assuming exercise of a one-year renewal at our
option. At February 28, 2003, $155,470,000 was outstanding,
$15,529,000 was
used to provide letters of credit and $329,001,000 was available for borrowing
under the unsecured credit facility.

Interest Rate Protection Agreements

We are not a party to any long-term interest rate agreements, other than
interest rate protection and swap agreements on approximately $166,000,000 of
our variable rate tax-exempt indebtedness. We intend, however, to evaluate the
need for long-term interest rate protection agreements as interest rate market
conditions dictate, and we have engaged a consultant to assist in managing our
interest rate risks and exposure.

Future Financing and Capital Needs

As of December 31, 2002, we had 12 new communities under construction, for
which a total estimated cost of $254,146,000 remained to be invested. In
addition, we had two communities under reconstruction, for which a total
estimated cost of $7,656,000 remained to be invested.


Substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the
communities currently under construction and reconstruction will be funded
from:

•

the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility;

•

the net proceeds from sales of existing communities;

•

retained operating cash; and/or

•

the issuance of debt or equity securities.

We expect to continue to fund
development costs related to pursuing development
rights from retained operating cash and borrowings under the unsecured credit
facility. We believe these sources of capital will be adequate to take the
proposed communities to the point in the development cycle where construction
can begin. Before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a
development right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete
these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to
obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may
have to abandon development rights, write-off associated pursuit costs that
were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we
will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such
pursuits.

Our liquidity could be adversely impacted by expanding development and
acquisition activities and/or reduced capital (as compared to prior years)
available from asset sales. To meet the balance of our liquidity needs under
such conditions, we would need to arrange additional capacity under our
existing unsecured credit facility, sell additional existing communities and/or
issue additional debt or equity securities. While we believe we have the
financial position to expand our short-term credit capacity and support our
capital markets activity, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in
completing these arrangements, sales or offerings. The failure to complete
these transactions on a cost-effective basis could have a material adverse
impact on our operating results and financial condition, including the
abandonment of development pursuits.

It is our policy to sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment
criteria when market conditions are favorable, and to redeploy the proceeds.
When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from
unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and
tax ramifications of each proposal. We intend to actively seek buyers for
communities that we determine to hold for sale. We expect to accelerate our
disposition program during 2003 in response to current and anticipated real
estate and capital markets conditions. However, we cannot assure you that
assets can be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market
conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy.
Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately
redeployed into revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a
community is to reduce total revenues, total expenses and funds from
operations. Therefore, an acceleration of our disposition program in 2003 may
adversely impact total revenues and funds from operations. As of February 28,
2003, we have six communities classified as held for sale under GAAP. We are actively pursuing the
disposition of these
communities and expect to close during the first and second quarters of 2003.  However,
we cannot assure you that these communities will
be sold as planned.

We have minority interest investments in three technology companies, including
Constellation Real Technologies LLC, (“Constellation”), an entity formed by a
number of real estate investment trusts and real estate operating companies for
the purpose of investing in multi-sector real estate technology opportunities.
Our original commitment to Constellation was $4,000,000 but, as a result of an
agreement among the members reducing the commitment due from each member, our
commitment is currently $2,600,000, of which we have contributed $959,000 to
date. The remaining unfunded commitment of $1,641,000 is expected to be funded
over the next five years. In January 2002, we invested an additional
$2,300,000 in Realeum, Inc., (“Realeum”), a company involved in the development
and deployment of a property management and leasing automation system.
Pursuant to an agreement with Realeum, we utilize the property management and
leasing automation system in exchange for payments under a licensing


arrangement. Realeum is negotiating licensing arrangements with other real
estate companies that we are unaffiliated with. If unsuccessful in negotiating
additional licensing agreements, Realeum may be required to obtain additional
sources of funding. Our third technology investment is in Rent.com, an
internet-based rental housing information provider. We have no obligation to
contribute additional funds to these technology investments, other than the
commitment to Constellation as previously described.

Stock Repurchase Program

In July 2002 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a common
stock repurchase program. Under this program, we may acquire shares of our
common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate
purchase price of $100,000,000. Actual purchases of stock will vary with
market conditions. The size of the stock repurchase program was designed so
that retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from sales of existing
apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions, will provide the
source of funding for the program, with our unsecured credit facility providing
temporary funding as needed. Through February 28, 2003, we have acquired
2,042,600 shares at an aggregate cost of $77,381,000 under this program.

Redemption of Preferred Stock

In July 2002, we redeemed all 2,300,000 outstanding shares of our 8.50% Series
C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, plus
$0.1417 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of
$57,826,000, including accrued dividends of $326,000. The redemption price was
funded in part by the sale on July 11, 2002 of 592,000 shares of Series I
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an
institutional investor for a net purchase price of $14,504,000. The dividend
rate on such shares was initially equal to 3.36% per annum (three month LIBOR
plus 1.5%) of the liquidation preference. As permitted under the terms of such
preferred stock, we redeemed all of the Series I Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock on August 29, 2002 for an aggregate redemption price of
$14,609,000 including accrued dividends of $68,000.

As of February 1, 2003, we have the following series of redeemable preferred
stock outstanding at an aggregate stated value of $181,692,500. These series
have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory
redemptions. As these series become redeemable, we will evaluate the
requirements necessary for such redemptions as well as the cost-effectiveness
based on the existing market conditions.

On February 18, 2003, we gave notice of our intent to redeem all 3,267,700
outstanding shares of our 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.
We anticipate closing this redemption on March 20, 2003 at a price of $25.00
per share, plus $0.0167 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate
redemption price of $81,747,000, including accrued dividends of $55,000. This
redemption will be funded by the sale of shares of Series J Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional
investor. The dividend rate on such shares will initially be based on three
month LIBOR plus 1.5%. The Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock will
be redeemable at any time at our option.


Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less.
In the event of significant inflation, this may enable us to realize increased
rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases.
Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of
inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end
of the lease term without penalty and therefore expose us to the effect of a
decline in market rents. In a deflationary rent environment, as is currently
being experienced, we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these
shorter-term leases.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use
judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates
and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts
and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is
possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting
in a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion
of accounting policies which we consider critical in that they may require
complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which
are inherently uncertain. Additional discussion of accounting policies which
we consider significant, including further discussion of the critical
accounting policies described below, can be found in the Notes to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Real Estate Development Rights

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development
opportunities for which we currently believe future development is probable.
These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. The
accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include a charge to expense to
provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable capitalized pre-development
costs. The determination of the charge to expense involves management
judgement regarding the probability that a pursuit will not proceed to
development.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from
residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” In accordance with our standard lease
terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash
concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the
approximate life of the lease – generally one year.

Real Estate

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in
the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a
comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community
over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated
projected operating cash flows of the community, we would recognize an
impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount
to its estimated fair market value.


Discontinued Operations

On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of
operations of any communities which have been sold during 2002, or otherwise
qualify as held for sale as of December 31, 2002, be presented as discontinued
operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements in both current and prior
periods presented. The community specific components of net income that are
presented as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation
and interest expense. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any
impairment loss) on the eventual disposal of communities held for sale is
presented as discontinued operations when recognized. Real estate assets held
for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value
less the cost to sell, and are presented separately in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale, no
further depreciation is recorded on the assets.

Investments in Technology Companies

We account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting
for Investments in Common Stock.” If there is an event or change in
circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, our policy is
to record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A
loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of
the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that
would justify the carrying amount of the investment. Due to the nature of
these investments, an impairment in value can be difficult to determine.

Stock-Based Compensation

During the periods presented in this report, we applied APB Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in
accounting for our employee stock options. No stock-based employee
compensation cost is reflected in net income, as all options granted under
those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. See Note 10, “Stock-Based Compensation
Plans,” in our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the
effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

Legal Contingencies

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the
ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by
insurance. While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with
certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our financial position or the results of operations.
Once it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the estimated
amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements. Both the amount of
the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered probable can be
difficult to determine.

ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain financial market risks, the most predominant being
fluctuations in interest rates. We monitor interest rate fluctuations as an
integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially
adverse effect on our results of operations. The effect of interest rate
fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting
operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy. The specific market
risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below.

Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of
borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as
outstanding bonds with variable interest rates. We had


$173,840,000 and $125,274,000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100
basis points higher throughout 2002 and 2001, our annual interest costs would
have increased by approximately $2,557,000 and $1,500,000, respectively, based
on balances outstanding during the applicable years.

We currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest
rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness. Under swap
agreements,

•

we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would
have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest
rate (generally, the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on
the date the agreement is entered into, plus a fixed increment), and

•

the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would
have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed
floating interest rate tied to a particular market index.

As of December 31, 2002, the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest
rate on approximately $166,000,000 of our variable rate tax-exempt debt.
Furthermore, a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately
$22,500,000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt exists as of December 31,
2002. The swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate tax-exempt debt
were not electively entered into by us but, rather, were a requirement of
either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of
our tax-exempt bond financings. Because the counterparties providing the swap
agreements are major financial institutions which have an A+ or better credit
rating by the Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group and the interest rates fixed by
the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such
agreements, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a
counterparty provider.

(5)

The 1994 Plan incorporates an evergreen formula pursuant to which the
aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan will increase
annually. On each January 1, the aggregate number of shares reserved for
issuance under the 1994 Plan will increase by a number of shares equal to a
percentage (ranging from 0.48% to 1.00%) of all outstanding shares of Common
Stock at the end of the year. The exact percentage used is determined based on
the percentage of all awards made under the 1994 Plan during the calendar year
that were in the form of stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the grant. In
accordance with this procedure, on January 1, 2003, the maximum number of
shares remaining available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan was
increased by 664,115 to 2,079,977.

Report of Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

AvalonBay Communities, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay
Communities, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AvalonBay
Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002
the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets.” In addition, as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the
Company changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context
otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its
subsidiaries) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real
estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Company focuses on the ownership and operation of upscale
apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States.
These markets are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific
Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the country.

At December 31, 2002, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership
interest in 137 operating apartment communities containing 40,179 apartment
homes in eleven states and the District of Columbia, of which two communities
containing 1,089 apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition, the
Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 12 communities
under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of 3,429 apartment
homes when completed. The Company also owned a direct or indirect ownership
interest in rights to develop an additional 38 communities that, if developed
in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 9,950 apartment homes.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company is the surviving corporation from the merger (the “Merger”) of Bay
Apartment Communities, Inc. (“Bay”) and Avalon Properties, Inc. (“Avalon”) on
June 4, 1998, in which Avalon shareholders received 0.7683 of a share of common
stock of the Company for each share owned of Avalon common stock. The Merger
was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the historical
financial statements for Avalon presented prior to the Merger. At that time,
Avalon ceased to legally exist, and Bay as the surviving legal entity adopted
the historical financial statements of Avalon. Consequently, Bay’s assets were
recorded in the historical financial statements of Avalon at an amount equal to
Bay’s debt outstanding at that time plus the value of capital stock retained by
the Bay stockholders, which approximates fair value. In connection with the
Merger, the Company changed its name from Bay Apartment Communities, Inc. to
AvalonBay Communities, Inc

.

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly-owned partnerships and certain joint venture
partnerships in addition to subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

In each of the partnerships structured as DownREITs, either the Company or one
of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there
are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is
represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT
partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution
before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the
partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the
distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership
interests have approximated the Company’s current common stock dividend per
share. Each DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely
the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the
initial distribution provided for in the partnership agreement. The holders of
units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of
limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market
value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of redemption. In
lieu of a cash redemption of a limited partner’s unit, the Company may elect to
acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of common stock.

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” and Statement of Position (“SOP”)
78-9, “Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.” The Company uses
the equity

F-7

method to account for investments in which it owns greater than 20%
of the equity value or has significant and disproportionate influence over that
entity. Investments in which the Company owns 20% or less of the equity value
and does not have significant and disproportionate influence are accounted for
using the cost method. If there is an event or change in circumstance that
indicates a loss in the value of an investment, the Company’s policy is to
record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A
loss in value would be indicated if the Company could not recover the carrying
value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings
capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company
did not recognize an impairment loss on any of its investments in
unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2002. However,
during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded an impairment
loss of $934 related to a technology investment in which the Company no longer
owns an equity interest.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from
residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.” In accordance with the Company’s
standard lease terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis.
Any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the
approximate life of the lease, which is generally one year.

The following reconciles total revenue in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) to total revenue adjusted to state concessions
on a cash basis for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000:

Real Estate

Significant expenditures which improve or extend the life of an asset are
capitalized. The operating real estate assets are stated at cost and consist of
land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other
costs incurred during their development, redevelopment and acquisition.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

The Company’s policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to
capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. Improvements and upgrades are
capitalized only if the item exceeds $15, extends the useful life of the asset
and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident.
Purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, are
capitalized only if the item is a new addition. The Company generally expenses
purchases of personal property made for replacement purposes.

The capitalization of costs during the development of assets (including
interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect
costs) begins when active development commences and ends when the asset is
delivered and a final certificate of occupancy is issued. Cost capitalization
during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan
fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) begins when an
apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment and ends when the
apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is placed
in-service.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 67,
“Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects,”
the Company capitalizes pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new
development opportunities for which the Company currently believes future
development is probable. Future development of these communities is dependent
upon various factors, including zoning and

F-8

regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. A
charge to expense is included in operating expenses, excluding property taxes
on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other
Comprehensive Income to provide an allowance for potentially unrecoverable
deferred development costs.

Depreciation is calculated on buildings and improvements using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven
to thirty years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range
from three years (primarily computer-related equipment) to seven years.

Lease terms for apartment homes are generally one year or less. Rental income
and operating costs incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment
lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue.

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in
the value of an operating community, the Company’s policy is to assess any
impairment in value by making a comparison of the current and projected
operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life, on an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If such carrying
amounts are in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the
community, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an
amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market
value. The Company has not recognized an impairment loss in 2002, 2001 or 2000
on any of its operating communities. However, the Company recognized an
impairment loss in 2002 related to land planned for disposition as of December
31, 2002. See Note 7, “Discontinued Operations – Real Estate Assets Held for
Sale” of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and has not revoked such
election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests
and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will
not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income it
distributes currently to its stockholders. Management believes that all such
conditions for the avoidance of income taxes have been met for the periods
presented. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes has
been made. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it
will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including
any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a
REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes
on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its
undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT
activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal,
state and local income taxes.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain debt
financing and are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the
effective interest method, over the shorter of the term of the loan or the
related credit enhancement facility, if applicable. Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.
Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was $15,765 and $11,916
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Cash in Escrow

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from the date acquired. The majority
of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrows is held at major
commercial banks.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate
risk and has designated these financial instruments as hedges under the
guidance of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities, an Amendment of Statement No. 133.” For fair value hedge
transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the risk being hedged are
recognized in current period earnings. For cash flow hedge transactions,
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported in other
comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges where the changes in the fair value
of the derivative exceeds the change in fair value of the hedged item, the
ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings. Derivatives
which are not part of a hedge relationship are recorded at fair value through
earnings. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has approximately $166,000 in
variable rate tax-exempt debt subject to cash flow hedges. See Note 5,
“Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” of the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity during each
period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to
shareholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects the
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges.

Earnings per Common Share

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,” basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to
earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted
basis. The Company’s earnings per common share are determined as follows:

For each of the years presented, certain options to purchase shares of common
stock were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater than the
average market price of the common shares for the period. The number of
options not included totaled 1,410,397, 18,269 and 7,500 in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

In 2002, 42,697 units of limited partnership (“DownREIT units”) were presented
for redemption and were purchased by the Company for $1,663. In addition, the
Company issued 102,756 DownREIT units valued at $5,000 in connection with the
acquisition of land. In 2001, 762 DownREIT units, valued at $36, were
exchanged for an equal number of shares of the Company’s common stock, and
22,076 DownREIT units were presented for redemption and purchased by the
Company for $864. The Company also issued 257,559 DownREIT units valued at
$12,304 as consideration for acquisitions of apartment communities and land.
In 2000, 1,520 DownREIT units, valued at $60, were issued as partial
consideration for the acquisition of an apartment community. In addition,
304,602 DownREIT units, valued at $10,926, were exchanged for an equal number
of shares of the Company’s common stock.

F-11

Stock-Based Compensation

During the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company applied
the intrinsic value method as provided in APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations, in accounting for its
employee stock options. No stock-based employee compensation cost is
reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant. See Note 10, “Stock-Based Compensation Plans,” for information
regarding the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

Business Interruption Insurance

During 2000, a fire occurred at one of the Company’s development communities,
which was under construction and unoccupied at the time. The Company had
property damage and business interruption insurance which covered this event.
Business interruption insurance proceeds of $5,800 and $2,500 are included in
other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Other Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. This settlement was finalized in 2002.

Executive Separation Costs

In February 2001, the Company announced certain management changes including
the departure of a senior executive who became entitled to severance benefits
in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement with the Company. The
Company recorded a charge of approximately $2,500 in the first quarter of 2001
related to the costs associated with such departure.

In December 2001, a senior executive of the Company retired from his management
position. Upon retirement, the Company recognized compensation expense of
approximately $784, relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock
grants.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In May 2002, SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections” was issued. SFAS
No. 145, among other items, rescinds SFAS No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses
from Extinguishments of Debt,” which provided that gains and losses from early
debt retirements be treated as extraordinary items. Under SFAS No. 145, gains
and losses from early debt retirements will only be treated as extraordinary
items if they meet the criteria for extraordinary items under APB No. 30. This
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The
Company will adopt this pronouncement effective January 1, 2003, but does not
expect it to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of
operations.

In June 2002, SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” was issued. This statement addresses financial accounting
and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and
nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity.”
Under SFAS No. 146, a liability for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities is only to be recognized when the liability is incurred and the
definition of a liability under Concepts Statement No. 6 is met, rather than at
the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit or disposal plan. This statement
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December
31, 2002. The Company will adopt this pronouncement effective January 1, 2003,
but does not expect it to have a material impact on its financial condition or
results of operations.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, Including Direct Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others.” FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its
interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain
guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required
to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value
of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company will apply
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 on a
prospective basis for any guarantees issued or modified after December 31,
2002, but

F-12

does not expect the adoption of FIN 45 to have a
material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” which amends SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS No. 148 provides alternative
methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148
amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 on both an annual and
interim basis to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in
financial statements about the effects of stock-based compensation. The
transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148 are
effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002 while the interim
disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after
December 15, 2002.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” which changes the guidelines for consolidation of and disclosure
related to unconsolidated entities, if those unconsolidated entities qualify as
variable interest entities, as defined in FIN 46. The provisions of FIN 46 are
to be applied effective immediately for variable interest entities created
after January 31, 2003, and effective July 1, 2003 for variable interest
entities created prior to February 1, 2003. If it is reasonably possible that
an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a variable
interest entity when FIN 46 becomes effective, the enterprise should make
certain disclosures in all financial statements initially issued after January
31, 2003, regardless of the date on which the variable interest entity was
created. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the
adoption of FIN 46 will result in the consolidation of any previously
unconsolidated entities. The adoption of FIN 46 may result in additional
disclosure about a limited number of investments in variable interest entities,
but such disclosure is not expected to be material.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Discontinued Operations

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” which requires that the assets and
liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been
sold during 2002, or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of December 31,
2002, be presented as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements in both current and prior periods presented. The
community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued
operations include net operating income, depreciation and interest expense. In
addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment loss) on the eventual
disposal of communities held for sale will be presented as discontinued
operations when recognized. This change in presentation will not have any
impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Real
estate assets held for sale will continue to be measured at the lower of the
carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell, and are presented
separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to
classification of a community as held for sale, no further depreciation is
recorded on the assets.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years’ financial
statements to conform with current year presentations.

Interest Capitalized

Capitalized interest associated with communities under development or
redevelopment totaled $29,937, $27,635 and $18,328 for the years ended December
31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Includes approximately $166,000 of variable rate notes in both years effectively fixed through
Hedged Derivatives, as described in Note 5, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” of
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company assumed $33,900 in
variable rate, tax-exempt debt related to a community acquisition and repaid
$21,225 related to a short-term construction loan, in addition to normal
monthly principal and interest payments. In the aggregate, mortgage notes
payable, excluding the short-term construction loan, mature at various dates
from May 2004 through February 2041 and are collateralized by certain apartment
communities. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has guaranteed approximately
$149,000 of mortgage notes payable held by subsidiaries; all such mortgage notes
payable are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The weighted average interest rate of the Company’s fixed rate
mortgage notes payable (conventional and tax-exempt) was 6.6% and 6.7% at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The weighted average interest rate
of the Company’s variable rate mortgage notes payable and its unsecured credit
facility (as discussed below), including the effect of certain financing
related fees, was 3.5% and 3.1% at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company issued $450,000 in
additional unsecured notes. The Company repaid $100,000 of previously issued
unsecured notes pursuant to their scheduled maturity, and no prepayment fees
were incurred. The Company’s unsecured notes contain a number of financial and
other covenants with which the Company must comply, including, but not limited
to, limits on the aggregate amount of total and secured indebtedness the
Company may have on a consolidated basis and limits on the Company’s required
debt service payments.

The Company has a $500,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility
with J.P. Morgan Chase and Fleet National Bank serving as co-agents for a
syndicate of commercial banks, which had $28,970 and $0 outstanding and $79,999
and $85,420 in letters of credit on December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Under the terms of the unsecured credit facility, if the Company elects to
increase the facility up to $650,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate
or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment, then the
Company will be able to increase the facility up to $650,000, and no member of
the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the
facility will only be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or
otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional funds. The Company pays
participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of $750 in equal
quarterly installments. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at
varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), rating
levels achieved on the Company’s unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule
selected by the Company. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per
annum (1.98% on December 31, 2002). Pricing could vary if there is a change in
rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in
rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05%
to 0.15%. In addition, the unsecured credit facility includes a competitive
bid option, which allows banks that are part of the
lender consortium to bid to make loans to the Company at a rate that is lower
than the stated rate provided by the unsecured credit facility for up to
$400,000. The Company is subject to certain customary covenants under the
unsecured credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain
maximum leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio, minimum
unencumbered assets and equity levels and restrictions on paying dividends in
amounts that exceed 95% of the Company’s Funds from Operations, as defined
therein. The existing facility matures in May 2005 assuming exercise of a
one-year renewal option by the Company.

Stockholders’ Equity

As of both December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company had authorized for issuance
140,000,000 and 50,000,000 shares of common and preferred stock, respectively.
Dividends on all series of issued preferred stock are cumulative from the date
of original issue and are payable quarterly in arrears on or before the 15th
day of each month as stated in the table below. None of the series of
preferred stock are redeemable prior to the date stated in the table below, but
on or after the stated date, may be redeemed for cash at the option of the
Company in whole or in part at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all
accrued and unpaid dividends, if any. In July 2002, the Company redeemed all
2,300,000 outstanding shares of its 8.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, plus $0.1417 in accrued and
unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $57,826, including
accrued dividends of $326. The redemption price was funded in part by the sale
on July 11, 2002 of 592,000 shares of Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a net
purchase price of $14,504. The dividend rate on such shares was initially
equal to 3.36% per annum (three month LIBOR plus 1.5%) of the liquidation
preference. As permitted under the terms of such preferred stock, the Company
redeemed all of the Series I Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock on August
29, 2002 for an aggregate redemption price of $14,609 including accrued
dividends of $68. The series of preferred stock outstanding have no stated
maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions.
Preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2002 were as follows:

During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company (i) issued 664,118 shares
of common stock in connection with stock options exercised, (ii) issued 144,718
common shares in connection with stock grants to employees of which 80% are
restricted, (iii) had forfeitures of 2,818 shares of restricted stock grants to
employees and (iv) withheld 34,876 shares to satisfy employees’ tax withholding
and other liabilities.

In addition, the Company announced in July 2002 that its Board of Directors had
authorized a common stock repurchase program. Under this program, the Company
may acquire shares of its common stock in open market or negotiated
transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $100,000. Actual purchases
of stock will vary with market conditions. The size of the stock repurchase
program was designed so that retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from
sales of existing apartment communities and a reduction in planned
acquisitions, will provide the source of funding for the program, with the
Company’s unsecured credit facility providing temporary funding as needed. As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had repurchased 1,281,600 shares of common
stock at an aggregate cost of $49,722 through this program.

Dividends per common share for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $2.80, $2.56 and
$2.24 per share, respectively. In 2002, dividends for preferred
shares redeemed during the year were $0.92 per share and dividends
for all non-redeemed preferred shares were $2.10 per share. In 2001,
dividends for preferred shares redeemed during the year were $1.41
per share and dividends for all non-redeemed preferred shares were
$2.10 per share. Dividends were $2.17 per preferred share in 2000.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company has historically used interest rate swap and cap agreements
(collectively, the “Hedged Derivatives”) to reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations on its variable rate tax-exempt bonds. The Company has not
entered into any interest rate hedge agreements or treasury locks for its
conventional unsecured debt and does not hold interest rate hedge agreements
for trading or other speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2002, the effect
of Hedged Derivatives is to fix approximately $166,000 of the Company’s
tax-exempt debt at a weighted average interest rate of 5.9% with an average
maturity of 3.7 years. In addition, a Hedged Derivative exists to fix the
interest rate on approximately $22,500 of the Company’s unconsolidated variable
rate debt as of December 31, 2002. These Hedged

F-16

Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, which as amended, was adopted by the Company
on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires that every derivative instrument be
recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value, with changes in fair value recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

The Company has determined that its Hedged Derivatives qualify as effective
cash-flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, resulting in the Company recording all
changes in the fair value of the Hedged Derivatives in other comprehensive
income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified
into earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash
flows. At January 1, 2001, in accordance with the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $6,412 to
other comprehensive loss to recognize at fair value all of the derivatives that
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. During the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded additional unrealized losses
to other comprehensive loss of $4,157 and $2,599, respectively, to adjust the
Hedged Derivatives to their fair value. In addition, a Swap Agreement with a
fair value of $528 was transferred in connection with the sale of a community
during the first quarter of 2001. The estimated amount, included in
accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2002, expected to be
reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months to offset the
variability of cash flows during this period is not material.

The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going basis, the
effectiveness of all hedges in offsetting cash flows of hedged items. Hedge
ineffectiveness did not have a material impact on earnings and the Company does
not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the future. The fair
values of the obligations under the Hedged Derivatives are included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in
interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. The
credit risk is the risk of a counterparty not performing under the terms of the
Hedged Derivatives. The counterparties to these Hedged Derivatives are major
financial institutions which have an A+ or better credit rating by the Standard
& Poor’s Ratings Group. The Company monitors the credit ratings of
counterparties and the amount of the Company’s debt subject to Hedged
Derivatives with any one party. Therefore, the Company believes the likelihood
of realizing material losses from counterparty non-performance is remote.
Market risk is the adverse effect of the value of financial instruments that
results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with
interest-rate contracts is managed by the establishment and monitoring of
parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken. These risks are managed by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer
and Vice President of Finance.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had investments in the following
unconsolidated real estate entities, which are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting, except as described below:

•

Falkland Partners, LLC

was formed as a general partnership in
July 1985 to own and operate Falkland Chase, a 450 apartment-home
community located in Silver Spring, Maryland. In 1993, Avalon
acquired a 50% ownership and economic interest in the partnership
for an investment of $2,200. The Company, as successor by merger to
Avalon in 1998, became the managing member of the limited liability
company in 2000 after conversion from a general partnership. The
Company has responsibility
for the day-to-day operations of the Falkland Chase community and is
the management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement.
As of December 31, 2002, Falkland Chase has $24,695 of tax-exempt
floating rate debt outstanding (1.0% as of December 31, 2002), which
matures in December 2030.

•

Town Run Associates

was formed as a general partnership in
November 1994 to develop, own and operate Avalon Run, a 426
apartment-home community located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.
Since formation of this venture, the Company has invested $1,803
and, following a preferred return on all

F-17

contributed equity (which
was achieved in 2002), has a 40% ownership and cash flow interest
with a 49% residual economic interest. The Company is responsible
for the day-to-day operations of the Avalon Run community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement.
The development of Avalon Run was funded entirely through equity
contributions from Avalon as well as the other venture partner, and
therefore Avalon Run is not subject to any outstanding debt as of
December 31, 2002.

•

Town Grove, LLC

was formed as a limited liability corporation
in December 1997 to develop, own and operate Avalon Grove, a 402
apartment-home community located in Stamford, Connecticut. Since
formation of this venture, the Company has invested $14,653 and,
following a preferred return on all contributed equity (which was
achieved in 2002), has a 49% ownership and a 50% cash flow and
residual economic interest. The Company is responsible for the
day-to-day operations of the Avalon Grove community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement.
The development of Avalon Grove was funded through contributions
from the Company and the other venture partner, and therefore Avalon
Grove is not subject to any outstanding debt as of December 31,
2002.

•

Avalon Terrace, LLC

— The Company acquired Avalon Bedford, a
388 apartment-home community located in Stamford, Connecticut in
December 1998. In May 2000, the Company transferred Avalon Bedford
to Avalon Terrace, LLC and subsequently admitted a joint venture
partner, while retaining a 25% ownership interest in this limited
liability company for an investment of $5,394 and a right to 50% of
cash flow distributions after achievement of a threshold return
(which was not achieved in 2002). The Company is responsible for
the day-to-day operations of the Avalon Bedford community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement. As
of December 31, 2002, Avalon Bedford has $22,500 in variable rate
debt outstanding, which came due in November 2002, but was extended
until November 2005. The interest rate on this debt is fixed
through a Hedged Derivative as discussed in Note 5, “Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

•

Arna Valley View Limited Partnership

— In connection with
the municipal approval process for the development of two
consolidated communities, the Company agreed to participate in the
formation of a limited partnership in February 1999 to develop,
finance, own and operate Arna Valley View, a 101 apartment-home
community located in Arlington, Virginia. This community has
affordable rents for 100% of apartment homes related to the
tax-exempt bond financing and tax credits used to finance
construction of the community. A subsidiary of the Company is the
general partner of the partnership with a 0.01% ownership interest.
The Company is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the
community, and is the management agent subject to the terms of a
management agreement. As of December 31, 2002, Arna Valley View has
$6,150 of variable rate tax-exempt bonds outstanding, which mature in
June 2032. In addition, Arna Valley View has $4,134 of 4% fixed
rate county bonds outstanding that mature in December 2030. Due to
the Company’s limited ownership and investment in this venture, it
is accounted for using the cost method.

investments using the equity method, with the remaining non-real estate
investments accounted for at cost. During the years ended December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, the Company recorded losses of $3,166, $1,730 and $719,
respectively, related to Realeum, Inc., one of the two investments accounted
for under the equity method, bringing the carrying value of this investment to
zero as of December 31, 2002. The aggregate carrying value of the Company’s
investment in unconsolidated non-real estate entities was $1,855 and $2,737 as of December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Discontinued Operations – Real Estate Assets Held for Sale

The Company has a policy of disposing of assets that are not consistent with
its long-term investment criteria when market conditions are favorable. In
connection with this strategy, the Company solicits competing bids from
unrelated parties for individual assets, and considers the sales price and tax
ramifications of each proposal. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the
Company sold one community, as summarized below:

As of December 31, 2002, the Company did not have any communities that
qualified as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144. However, as
required under SFAS No. 144, the operations for the community sold in 2002 have
been presented as discontinued operations. Accordingly, certain
reclassifications have been made in prior years to reflect the results of
operations for this community as discontinued operations, consistent with
current year presentation. The following is a summary of income from
discontinued operations for the years presented:

In addition, the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets include net real

liabilities of $820 as of December 31, 2001 relating to this community.

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has determined that two land parcels with
an aggregate carrying value (prior to adjustment) of $26,739 would not likely
proceed to development and are planned for disposition. Although these assets
do not qualify as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144, the Company
performed an analysis of the carrying value of these assets in connection with
this change in anticipated use. As a result, the

F-20

Company recorded an impairment loss of $6,800 during the year ended December 31, 2002 to reflect
these parcels at fair market value (based on their entitlement status as of
December 31, 2002), less estimated selling costs. See Note 14, “Subsequent
Events,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

Employment Agreements and Arrangements

As of December 31, 2002, the Company has employment agreements with six
executive officers. The employment agreements provide for severance payments
and generally also provide for accelerated vesting of stock options and
restricted stock in the event of a termination of employment (except for a
termination by the Company with cause or a voluntary termination by the
employee). The current term of these agreements ends on dates that vary
between December 2003 and December 2006. The employment agreements provide for
one-year automatic renewals (two years in the case of the
CEO) after the initial term unless an advance notice of
non-renewal is provided by either party. Under five of the agreements, upon a
notice of non-renewal by the Company, the officer may terminate his employment
and receive a severance payment. Upon a change in control, the agreements
provide for an automatic extension of up to three years from the date of the
change in control. The employment agreements provide for base salary and
incentive compensation in the form of cash awards, stock options and stock
grants subject to the discretion of, and attainment of performance goals
established by, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company adopted an Officer Severance
Program (the “Program”) for the benefit of those officers of the Company who do
not have employment agreements. Under the Program, in the event an officer who
is not otherwise covered by a severance arrangement is terminated (other than
for cause) within two years of a change in control (as defined) of the Company,
such officer will generally receive a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of
such officer’s base salary and cash bonus, as well as accelerated vesting of
stock options and restricted stock.

Legal Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by
insurance. If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the
estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial statements. While
the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

9.

Segment Reporting

The Company’s reportable operating segments include Established Communities,
Other Stabilized Communities, and Development/Redevelopment Communities.
Annually as of January 1st, the Company determines which of its communities
fall into each of these categories and maintains that classification throughout
the year for the purpose of reporting segment operations.

•

Established Communities

(also known as Same
Store Communities) are communities where a comparison
of operating results from the prior year to the current
year is
meaningful, as these communities were owned and had
stabilized occupancy and costs as of the beginning of the
prior year. These communities are divided into geographic
regions. For the year 2002, the Established Communities
were communities that had stabilized occupancy and costs
as of January 1, 2001. A community is considered to have
stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of
95% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary
of completion of development or redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all
other completed communities that have stabilized
occupancy, as defined above.

F-21

•

Development/Redevelopment Communities

consists of communities that are under construction and
have not received a final certificate of occupancy,
communities where substantial redevelopment is in
progress or is planned to begin during the current year
and communities under lease-up, that have not reached
stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January
1, 2002.

The primary financial measure for Established and Other Stabilized Communities
is Net Operating Income (“NOI”), which is calculated at the community level and
represents total revenue less direct property operating expenses, including
property taxes, and excludes property management and other indirect operating expenses,
interest expense, depreciation expense, general and administrative expense and
impairment losses. The primary performance measure for communities under
development or redevelopment depends on the stage of completion. While under
development, management monitors actual construction costs against budgeted
costs as well as lease-up pace and rent levels compared to budget.

The table on the following page provides details of the Company’s segment
information as of the dates specified. The segments are classified based on
the individual community’s status as of the beginning of the given calendar
year. Therefore, each year the composition of communities within each business
segment is adjusted. Accordingly, the amounts between years are not directly
comparable. The accounting policies applicable to the operating segments
described above are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies.

F-22

F-23

Operating expenses as reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations and Other Comprehensive Income include $32,163, $32,967 and $28,111
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, of property
management and other indirect operating expenses that are not allocated to individual communities.
These costs are not reflected in NOI as shown in the above tables.
Gross real estate as shown above does not include communities held for sale of
$30,642 as reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of
December 31, 2001. Segment information for the periods ending December 31,
2001 and 2000 have been adjusted for the communities that were designated as
held for sale or sold in 2002 as described in Note 7, “Discontinued Operations
– Real Estate Assets Held for Sale,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

10.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company adopted the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on
March 31, 2001 (the “1994 Plan”), for the purpose of encouraging and enabling
the Company’s officers, associates and directors to acquire a proprietary
interest in the Company and as a means of aligning management and stockholder
interests and as a retention incentive for key associates. Individuals who are
eligible to participate in the 1994 Plan include officers, other associates,
outside directors and other key persons of the Company and its subsidiaries who
are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth or profitability of
the Company and its subsidiaries. The 1994 Plan authorizes (i) the grant of
stock options that qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code (“ISOs”), (ii) the grant of stock options that do not so
qualify, (iii) grants of shares of restricted and unrestricted common stock,
(iv) grants of deferred stock awards, (v) performance share awards entitling
the recipient to acquire shares of common stock and (vi) dividend equivalent
rights.

As of December 31, 2002, under the 1994 Plan a maximum of 1,415,862 shares of
common stock were available for issuance. On each January 1, the maximum
number available for issuance under the 1994 Plan is increased by between 0.48%
and 1.00% of the total number of shares of common stock and DownREIT units
actually outstanding on such date. On January 1, 2003, the maximum number
available for issuance was increased by 664,115 to 2,079,977. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the maximum number of shares of stock for which ISOs may be
issued under the 1994 Plan shall not exceed 2,500,000 and no awards shall be
granted under the 1994 Plan after May 11, 2011. For purposes of this
limitation, shares of common stock which are forfeited, canceled and reacquired
by the Company, satisfied without the issuance of common stock or otherwise
terminated (other than by exercise) shall be added back to the shares
of common
stock available for issuance under the 1994 Plan. Stock options with respect
to no more than 300,000 shares of stock may be granted to any one individual
participant during any one calendar year period. Options granted to officers
and employees under the 1994 Plan vest over periods (and may be subject to
accelerated vesting under certain circumstances) as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and must expire no later than
ten years from the date of grant. Options granted to non-employee directors
under the 1994 Plan are subject to accelerated vesting under certain limited
circumstances, become exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of
grant, and expire ten years from the date of grant. Restricted stock granted
to officers and employees under the 1994 Plan vest over periods (and may be
subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances) as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Generally, the
restricted stock grants that have been awarded to officers and employees vest
over four years, with 20% vesting immediately on the grant date and the
remaining 80% vesting equally over the next four years from the date of grant.
Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors vests 20% on the date of
issuance and 20% on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of
issuance. Options to purchase 1,497,504, 2,780,757, and 3,123,713 shares of
common stock were available for grant under the 1994 Plan at December 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively.

Before the Merger, Avalon had adopted its 1995 Equity Incentive Plan (the
“Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan”). Under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan, a maximum
number of 3,315,054 shares (or 2,546,956 shares as adjusted for the Merger) of
common stock were issuable, plus any shares of common stock represented by
awards under Avalon’s
1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Avalon 1993 Plan”) that were
forfeited, canceled, reacquired by Avalon, satisfied without the issuance of
common stock or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise). Options

F-24

granted to officers, non-employee directors and associates under the Avalon
1995 Incentive Plan generally vested over a three-year term, expire ten years
from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the date of
grant.

In connection with the Merger, the exercise prices and the number of options
under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan and the Avalon 1993 Plan were adjusted to
reflect the equivalent Bay shares and exercise prices based on the 0.7683 share
conversion ratio used in the Merger. Officers, non-employee directors and
associates with Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan or Avalon 1993 Plan options may
exercise their adjusted number of options for the Company’s common stock at the
adjusted exercise price. As of June 4, 1998, the date of the Merger, options
and other awards ceased to be granted under the Avalon 1993 Plan or the Avalon
1995 Incentive Plan. Accordingly, there were no options to purchase shares of
common stock available for grant under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan or the
Avalon 1993 Plan at December 31, 2002, 2001 or 2000.

Information with respect to stock options granted under the 1994 Plan, the
Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan and the Avalon 1993 Plan is as follows:

For options outstanding at December 31, 2002 under the 1994 Plan, 170,600
options had exercise prices ranging between $18.37 and $29.99 and a weighted
average contractual life of 2.2 years, 1,473,010 options had exercise prices
ranging between $30.00 and $39.99 and a weighted average contractual life of
6.2 years, and 1,522,397 options had exercise prices ranging between $40.00 and
$49.90 and a weighted average contractual life of 8.6 years. Options
outstanding at December 31, 2002 for the Avalon 1993 and Avalon 1995 Plans had
exercise prices ranging from $26.68 to $39.70 and a weighted average
contractual life of 4.1 years.

The Company applies the intrinsic value method as provided in APB Opinion No.
25 and related interpretations in accounting for its Plans. Accordingly, no
compensation expense has been recognized for the stock option portion of the
stock-based compensation plan.

F-25

The following table illustrates the effect on the Company’s net income
available to common stockholders and earnings per share if the Company had
applied the fair value recognition provisions as prescribed under SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to the Plans (unaudited):

The fair value of the options granted during 2002 is estimated at $4.52 per
share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with
the following assumptions: dividend yield of 6.15%, volatility of 18.9%,
risk-free interest rates of 4.81%, actual number of forfeitures, and an
expected life of approximately 7 years. The fair value of the options granted
during 2001 is estimated at $4.83 per share on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
yield of 5.58%, volatility of 16.47%, risk-free interest rates of 5.07%, actual
number of forfeitures, and an expected life of approximately 3 years. The fair
value of the options granted during 2000 is estimated at $3.76 per share on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
assumptions: dividend yield of 6.51%, volatility of 15.93%, risk-free interest
rates of 6.61%, actual number of forfeitures, and an expected life of
approximately 3 years.

In October 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (as amended, the “ESPP”). Initially 1,000,000 shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. There are currently 702,342
shares remaining available for issuance under the plan. Full-time employees of
the Company generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if, as of the
last day of the applicable election period, they have been employed by the
Company for at least one month. All other employees of the Company are
eligible to participate provided that as of the applicable election period they
have been employed by the Company for twelve months. Under the ESPP, eligible
employees are permitted to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions, subject to maximum purchase limitations. The ESPP provides
for a series of “purchase periods.” Prior to 2000, there were two purchase
periods per year of six months each. Since 2000, there has been one purchase
period per year. Beginning in 2003, the purchase period will be a period of
seven months beginning each May 1 and ending each November 30. The purchase
price for common stock purchased under the plan is 85% of the lesser of the
fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the
applicable purchase period or the last day of the applicable purchase period.
The offering dates, purchase dates and duration of purchase periods may be
changed by the Board of Directors, if the change is announced prior to the
beginning of the affected date or purchase period. The Company issued 29,345,
14,917 and 34,055 shares under the ESPP for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

11.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Cash and cash equivalent balances are held with various financial institutions
and may at times exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
limit. The Company monitors credit ratings of these financial institutions and
the concentration of cash and cash equivalent balances with any one financial
institution and believes the likelihood of realizing material losses from the
excess of cash and cash equivalent balances over insurance limits is remote.

F-26

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by
management using available market information and established valuation
methodologies, including discounted cash flows. Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could
realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect
on the estimated fair value amounts.

•

Cash equivalents, rents receivable, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, and other liabilities are carried at their
face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values.

•

Bond indebtedness and notes payable with an aggregate
carrying value of $2,442 and $2,083 had an estimated
aggregate fair value of $2,639 and $2,191 at December 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

12.

Related Party Arrangements

Purchase of Mortgage Loan

The Company’s Chairman and CEO, and the Company’s former Chairman and CEO, are
partners of an entity that is the general partner of Arbor Commons Associates
Limited Partnership (“Arbor Commons Associates”). Arbor Commons Associates
owns Avalon Arbor, a 302 apartment home community in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.
Concurrently with its initial public offering in November 1993,
Avalon purchased an existing
participating mortgage loan made to Arbor Commons Associates that was
originated by CIGNA Investments, Inc. The mortgage loan is secured by Arbor
Commons Associates’ interest in Avalon Arbor. This loan accrues interest at a
fixed rate of 10.2% per annum, payable at 9.0% per annum. The balance of the
note receivable at both December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $21,483. The balance of
accrued interest on the note receivable as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, was $4,965 and $5,231, and is included in other assets on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Related interest income of $3,091,
$3,081 and $3,009 was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively. Under the terms of the loan, the Company (as successor to
Avalon) receives (as contingent interest) 50% of the cash flow after the 10.2%
accrual rate is paid and 50% of the residual profits upon the sale of the
community.

Unconsolidated entities

The Company manages several unconsolidated real estate joint venture entities
for which it receives management fee revenue. From these entities the Company
received management fee revenue of $1,019, $1,011 and $691 in the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Indebtedness of Management

The Company has a recourse loan program under which the Company lends amounts
to or on behalf of employees (“Stock Loans”) equivalent to the estimated
employees’ tax withholding liabilities related to the vesting of restricted
stock under the 1994 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated on March 31,
2001. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to senior
officers will be renewed and the Company intends to phase out the Stock Loan
program for all other participants over a period of approximately one year.
The principal balance outstanding under the Stock Loans to employees was $1,133
at both December 31, 2002 and 2001. The balance of accrued interest on the
notes receivable was $45 and $100 as of December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Interest income on the notes of $61, $62 and $76 was recorded
for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Each Stock
Loan is made for a one-year term, is a full personal recourse obligation of the
borrower

F-27

and is secured by a pledge to the Company of the stock that vested and gave
rise to the tax withholding liability for which the loan was made. In
addition, dividends on the pledged stock are automatically remitted to the
Company and applied toward repayment of the Stock Loan.

Consulting Agreement with Mr. Meyer

In March 2000, the Company and Gilbert M. Meyer announced that Mr. Meyer would
retire as Executive Chairman of the Company in May 2000. Although Mr. Meyer
ceased his day-to-day involvement with the Company as an executive officer, he
continues to serve as a director. In addition, pursuant to a consulting
agreement which terminates in May 2003, Mr. Meyer agreed to serve as a
consultant to the Company for three years following his retirement for an
annual fee of $1,395. In such capacity he responds to requests for assistance
or information concerning business matters with which he became familiar while
employed and he provides business advice and counsel to the Company with
respect to business strategies and acquisitions, dispositions, development and
redevelopment of multifamily rental properties.

Director Compensation

The Company’s Stock Incentive Plan provides that directors of the Company who
are also employees receive no additional compensation for their services as a
director. Under the Stock Incentive Plan, on the fifth business day following
each annual meeting of stockholders, each of the Company’s non-employee
directors automatically receives options to purchase 7,000 shares of common
stock at the last reported sale price of the common stock on the NYSE on such
date, and a restricted stock (or deferred stock award) grant of 2,500 shares of
common stock. The Company recorded compensation expense relating to these
deferred stock awards in the amount of $743, $624 and $525 in the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Deferred compensation relating
to these deferred stock awards was $757 and $688 on December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Investment in Realeum, Inc.

As an employee incentive and retention mechanism, the Company arranged for
officers of the Company to hold direct or indirect economic interest in
Realeum, Inc. Realeum, Inc. is a company involved in the development and
deployment of a property management and leasing automation system, in which the
Company invested $2,300 in January 2002. The Company currently utilizes this
property management and leasing automation system and has paid $480, $80 and $0
to Realeum, Inc. under the terms of its licensing arrangements during the years
ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Subsequent Events (Unaudited)

As of February 28, 2003, six communities previously held for operating purposes were
classified as held for sale under SFAS No. 144. These communities had an
aggregate net real estate carrying value of $129,032 and debt of $27,305 as of
December 31, 2002. The Company is actively pursuing the
disposition of these communities and expects to close during the
first and second quarters of 2003.

For the period January 1, 2003
through February 28, 2003, the Company has
repurchased an additional 761,000 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost
of $27,659 through its common stock repurchase program.

On January 15, 2003, $50,000 in unsecured notes matured and were paid,
including the balance of accrued interest.

On February 18, 2003, the Company gave notice of its intent to redeem all
3,267,700 outstanding shares of its 8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock. The closing of this redemption is anticipated on March 20,
2003 at a price of $25.00 per share, plus $0.0167 in accrued and unpaid
dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $81,747, including accrued
dividends of $55. This redemption will be funded by the sale of shares of
Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to
an institutional investor. The dividend rate on such shares will initially be
based on three month LIBOR plus 1.5%. The Series J Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock will be redeemable at any time at the Company’s option.

In February 2003, the Company won an appeal regarding the entitlement status of
one of the two land parcels planned for disposition as of December 31, 2002.
If the Company decides to continue with the planned disposition, this change in
entitlement status may increase the potential value of the land and therefore
decrease the previously estimated loss that would be recognized at the date of
disposal. However, the Company is currently reevaluating the planned disposal
of this parcel, which may result in 2003 in the partial recovery of the
impairment loss recognized in 2002, if the Company decides to hold the land for
development.
