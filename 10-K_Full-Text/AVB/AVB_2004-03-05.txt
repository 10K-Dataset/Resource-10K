ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be
treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax
purposes. We focus on the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and operation of apartment communities in
high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. This is because we believe
that, long term, the limited new supply of apartment homes and lower housing
affordability in these markets will result in larger increases in cash flows
relative to other markets over an entire business cycle. These
barriers-to-entry generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process
with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and
entitled land is in limited supply. Our markets are located in the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California
regions of the United States. We believe that we have penetrated substantially
all of the high barrier-to-entry markets of the country.

At February 27, 2004, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest
in 131 operating apartment communities containing 38,504 apartment homes in ten
states and the District of Columbia, of which two communities containing 1,089
apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition, we owned or held a
direct or indirect ownership interest in 11 communities under construction that
are expected to contain an aggregate of 3,493 apartment homes when completed.
We also owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an
additional 40 communities that, if developed in the manner expected, will
contain an estimated 10,070 apartment homes. We generally obtain ownership in
an apartment community by developing a new community on vacant land or by
acquiring and either repositioning or redeveloping an existing community. In
selecting sites for development, redevelopment or acquisition, we favor
locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to
recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.

Our real estate investments consist of the following reportable segments:
Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities and
Development/Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are generally
operating communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy and
operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year. Other Stabilized
Communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized
occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year, but
had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year.
Development/Redevelopment Communities consist of communities that are under
construction, communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is
planned to begin during the current year and communities under lease-up. A
more detailed description of these segments and other related information can
be found in Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of the Consolidated Financial
Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.

Our principal financial goal is to increase
  long-term stockholder value by successfully and cost-effectively developing,
  redeveloping, acquiring, owning and operating high-quality communities in our
  selected markets that contain features and amenities desired by residents, as
  well as by providing our residents with efficient and effective service. To
  help fulfill this goal, we regularly (i) monitor our investment allocation
  by geographic market and product type, (ii) develop, redevelop and acquire
  apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry markets with growing or high
  potential for demand, (iii) selectively sell apartment communities that no longer
  meet our long-term strategy due to product type, location or relative potential
  for future appreciation and redeploy the proceeds from those sales, and (iv) endeavor
  to maintain a capital structure that is aligned with our business risks such
  that we maintain continuous access to cost-effective capital. Our
  long-term strategy is to more deeply penetrate the high barrier-to-entry markets
  in our chosen regions with a broad range of products and services and an intense
  focus on our customer. A substantial majority of our current communities are
  upscale (commanding among the highest rents in their submarkets). We also pursue
  the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of
  customer segments and price points, consistent with our goal to offer a broad
  range of products and services.


During the three years ended December 31,
  2003, we acquired five apartment communities, disposed of 20 apartment communities,
  and completed the development of 23 apartment communities and the redevelopment
  of three apartment communities. During 2003, we shifted from acquiring to selling
  apartment communities in response to strong investor demand, allowing us to realize a portion
  of the value created over the past business cycle, as well as providing additional
  liquidity. In 2004, we plan to continue our disposition activity, although at
  a reduced level, and we expect to expand our acquisition and development volume.
  The level of disposition, acquisition or development activity, however, is heavily
  influenced by capital market conditions, including prevailing interest rates.
  A further discussion of our development, redevelopment, disposition and acquisition
  strategy follows.

Development Strategy.

We carefully select land for development and follow
established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of
development. As one of the largest developers of multifamily apartment
communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States, we identify
development opportunities through local market presence and access to local
market information achieved through our regional offices. In addition to our
principal executive offices in Alexandria, Virginia, we also maintain regional
offices and administrative or specialty offices in or near the following
cities:

•

Boston, Massachusetts;

•

Chicago, Illinois;

•

New Canaan, Connecticut;

•

New York, New York;

•

Newport Beach, California;

•

San Jose, California;

•

Seattle, Washington; and

•

Woodbridge, New Jersey.

After selecting a target site, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire
the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options
and long-term conditional contracts generally enable us to acquire the target
site shortly before the start of construction, which reduces
development-related risks as well as preserves capital. After we acquire land,
we generally shift our focus to construction. Except for certain mid-rise and
high-rise apartment communities where we may elect to use third-party general
contractors or construction managers, we act as our own general contractor and
construction manager. We generally perform these functions directly (and not
through a subsidiary) both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and
partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. We believe this enables us
to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction
schedules and significant cost savings. Our development, property management
and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure high-quality
workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operational
phase.

Throughout this report, the term “development” is used to refer to the entire
property development cycle, including pursuit of zoning approvals, procurement
of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process.
References to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property,
which is only one element of the development cycle.

Redevelopment Strategy

. When we
  undertake the redevelopment of a community, our goal is to generally renovate
  and/or rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is significantly
  below replacement cost and the community is one of the highest quality apartment
  communities or best rental values for an apartment community in its local area.
  We have established procedures to minimize both the cost and risks of redevelopment.
  Our redevelopment teams, which include key redevelopment, construction and property
  management personnel, monitor redevelopment progress. We believe we achieve
  significant cost savings by acting as our own general contractor. More importantly,
  this helps to ensure high-quality design and workmanship and a smooth and timely
  transition into the lease-up and restabilization phase.


Throughout this report, the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire
redevelopment cycle, including planning and procurement of architectural and
engineering designs, budgeting and actual renovation work. The actual
renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction,” which is only one element
of the redevelopment cycle.

Disposition Strategy.

We sell assets when market conditions are favorable and redeploy the
proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire
communities and to rebalance our portfolio across geographic regions. This
also allows us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business
cycle, as well as provides additional liquidity. We are then able to redeploy
the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of
capital externally by issuing debt or equity securities. When we decide to
sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties
for these individual assets and consider the sales price of each proposal.

Acquisition Strategy.

Our core competencies in development and redevelopment
discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target. From
time to time, in order to achieve rapid penetration into markets that are
generally supply constrained and in which we desire an increased presence and
to help us achieve our desired product mix, or to rebalance our portfolio, we
will acquire existing apartment communities.

Property Management Strategy

. We intend to increase operating income through
innovative, proactive property management that will result in higher revenue
from communities and controlled operating expenses.

Our principal strategies to maximize revenue include:

•

strong focus on resident satisfaction;

•

staggering lease terms such that lease expirations are better matched to traffic patterns;

•

balancing high occupancy with premium pricing, and increasing rents as market conditions permit;

•

managing community occupancy for optimal rental revenue levels; and

•

applying new technology to optimize revenue from each community.

Controlling operating expenses is another way in which we intend to increase
earnings growth. Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue
allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue,
thereby increasing operating margins. We control operating expenses as follows:

•

receive and approve invoices on-site to ensure careful
monitoring of budgeted versus actual expenses;

•

purchase supplies in bulk where possible;

•

bid third-party contracts on a volume basis;

•

strive to retain residents through high levels of service in
order to eliminate the cost of preparing an apartment home for a new
resident and to reduce marketing and vacant apartment utility costs;

•

perform turnover work in-house or hire third-parties,
generally depending upon the least costly alternative;

•

undertake preventive maintenance regularly to maximize
resident satisfaction and property and equipment life; and

•

aggressively pursue real estate tax appeals.

On-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the net
operating income produced at their respective communities.

We generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities
directly (and not through a subsidiary) both for ourselves and the joint
ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner.

We are also pursuing ancillary services which could provide additional revenue
sources. In general, as a REIT we cannot directly provide services to our
tenants that are not customarily provided by a landlord, nor can we share in
the income of a third party that provides such services. However, we can
provide such non-customary services to residents if we do so through a “taxable
REIT subsidiary,” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “C corporation”
and is therefore subject to federal income taxes. We have used taxable REIT
subsidiaries on a limited basis, such as to receive a commission from a
“preferred provider” maid service company used by residents.


Technology Strategy.

We believe that an innovative management information
system infrastructure is an important element in managing our future growth.
This is because timely and accurate collection of financial and resident
profile data will enable us to maximize revenue through careful leasing
decisions and financial management.

We currently have minority investments in three technology companies. These
investments were made with the belief that they would promote the development
and application of technology and services which would improve the operating
performance of our real estate holdings. Our technology investments consist of
(i) an entity engaged in the development and deployment of an on-site property
management and leasing automation system that enables management to capture,
review and analyze data to a greater extent than is possible using existing
commercial software; (ii) an entity formed by a number of real estate
investment trusts and real estate operating companies for the purpose of
investing in multi-sector real estate technology opportunities; and (iii) an
internet-based rental housing information provider.

Financing Strategy.

We have consistently maintained, and intend to continue to
maintain, a capital structure that is aligned to the business risks
presented by our corporate strategy. At December 31, 2003, our
debt-to-total market capitalization was 39.9%, and our permanent long-term
floating rate debt, not including borrowings under our unsecured credit
facility, was 1.4% of total market capitalization. Total market
capitalization reflects the aggregate of the market value of our common stock,
the market value of our operating partnership units outstanding (based on the
market value of our common stock), the liquidation preference of our preferred
stock and the outstanding principal amount of our debt.

We estimate that a portion of our short-term liquidity needs will be met from
retained operating cash and borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit
facility. If required to meet the balance of our current or anticipated
liquidity needs, we will attempt to arrange additional capacity under our
existing unsecured credit facility, sell existing communities or land and/or
issue additional debt or equity securities. A determination to engage in an
equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market
and economic conditions, including interest rates, our short and long term
liquidity needs, the adequacy of our expected liquidity sources, the relative
costs of debt and equity capital, and growth opportunities. A summary of debt
and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in
Item 8 of this report.

While we believe we have the financial position to expand our short-term credit
capacity and access the capital markets as needed, we cannot assure you that we
will be successful in completing these arrangements, sales or offerings. The
failure to complete these transactions on a cost-effective basis or at all
could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial
condition.

We may, from time to time, enter into joint ventures (including limited
liability companies) or partnerships through which we would own an indirect
economic interest in less than 100% of the property or properties owned
directly by such joint venture or partnership. Our decision whether to hold an
apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the
community through a joint venture or partnership is based on a variety of facts
and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a
seller of land or of a community, who may prefer that (or who may require less
payment if) the land or community is contributed to a joint venture or
partnership; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by
market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our
capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our
projection, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our
invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture or partnership vehicle
is used. Any future investments in joint ventures or partnerships will not be
limited to a specified percentage of our assets. Each joint venture or
partnership agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate
and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying
degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement.

In addition, we may, from time to time, offer shares of our equity securities,
debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property.

While we emphasize equity real estate investments in apartment communities, we
have the ability, which would be exercised in the discretion of our Board of
Directors, to invest in other types of real estate, mortgages (including
participating or convertible mortgages), securities of other REITs or real
estate operating companies, or securities of


technology companies that relate
to our real estate operations or of companies that provide services to us or
our residents, in each case consistent with our qualification as a REIT. On
occasion, we own and operate retail space at our communities when either (i)
the highest and best use of the space is for retail (e.g., street level in an
urban area) or (ii) we believe the retail space will enhance the attractiveness
of the community to residents. As of December 31, 2003, we had a total of
192,040 square feet of rentable retail space that produced gross rental revenue
in 2003 of $2,329,000 (0.4% of total revenue). Any investment in securities of
other entities is subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross
income tests necessary for REIT qualification. Our current policy does not
contemplate future investments in mortgages or deeds of trust.

We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of
securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so. At all times we intend
to make investments in a manner as to qualify as a REIT unless, because of
circumstances or changes to the Internal Revenue Code (or the Treasury
Regulations), the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our
best interest to qualify as a REIT.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our leases are for a term of one year or less, which may
enable us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the
beginning of new leases. Such short-term leases generally minimize the risk to
us of the adverse effects of inflation, although as a general rule these leases
permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore
our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more
quickly than if our leases were for longer terms. Short-term leases combined with
relatively consistent demand have allowed rents, and therefore cash flow from
the portfolio, to provide an attractive inflation hedge. However, in a
deflationary rent environment as is currently being experienced, we are exposed
to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

Tax Matters

We filed an election with our initial federal income tax return to be taxed as
a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and intend to
maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a qualified REIT, with
limited exceptions, we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income
tax laws at the corporate level on our net income to the extent net income is
distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to
avoid income tax at the corporate level.

Competition

We face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance
companies, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies
and other apartment REITs, to acquire and develop apartment communities and
acquire land for future development. As an owner and operator of apartment
communities, we also face competition for prospective residents from other
operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or
better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value proposition
given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We also
compete with the condominium and single-family home markets. Although we often
compete against large sophisticated developers and operators for development
opportunities and for prospective residents, real estate developers and
operators of any size can provide effective competition.

Environmental and Related Matters

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and
ordinances, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be
required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and
remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product
releases at the property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs
incurred by these parties as a result of the contamination. These damages and
costs may be substantial. The presence of such substances, or the failure to
properly remediate the contamination, may adversely affect the owner’s ability
to borrow against, sell or rent the affected property. In addition, some
environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the
government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.


Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the
removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (“ACMs”)
when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of reconstruction,
remodeling, renovation, or demolition of a building. These laws may impose
liability for release of ACMs and may provide for third parties to seek
recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury
associated with exposure to ACMs. We are not aware that any ACMs were used in
the construction of the communities we developed. ACMs were, however, used in
the construction of several of the communities that we acquired. We have
implemented an operations and maintenance program for each of the communities
at which ACMs have been detected. We do not anticipate that we will incur any
material liabilities as a result of the presence of ACMs at our communities.

We are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented
an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities. We do not
anticipate that we will incur any material liabilities as a result of the
presence of lead paint at our communities.

All of our stabilized operating communities, and all of the communities that we
are currently developing or redeveloping, have been subjected to at least a
Phase I or similar environmental assessment, which generally does not involve
invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling. These assessments,
together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties, have not
revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that
we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets,
financial condition or results of operations. In connection with our
ownership, operation and development of communities, from time to time we
undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other
contaminants. In some cases, an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to
rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination. There can be no
assurance, however, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be
undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all,
in the event that environmental liability arises.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on
building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered
or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at
multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a
new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain
molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic
or other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the
importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us
when they see mold or excessive moisture. We have established procedures for
promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment
homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the
resident believe a health risk is present. However, we cannot assure that
mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner.
If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be
required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the
mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities.

Additionally, we have occasionally been involved in developing, managing,
leasing and operating various properties for third parties. Consequently, we
may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore,
potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs
which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances. We are not aware of any
material environmental liabilities with respect to properties managed or
developed by us or our predecessors for such third parties.


We cannot assure you that:

•

the environmental assessments described above have identified
all potential environmental liabilities;

•

no prior owner created any material environmental condition
not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments;

•

no environmental liabilities have developed since the
environmental assessments were prepared;

•

the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our
communities, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, will
not affect the environmental condition of our communities;

•

future uses or conditions, including, without limitation,
changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, will not
result in the imposition of environmental liability; and

•

no environmental liabilities will develop at communities that
we have sold for which we may have liability.

Other Information

Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current
reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge in
the “Investor Relations” section of our website (www.avalonbay.com) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the
SEC.

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1978. In
1995, we reincorporated in the State of Maryland and have been focused on the
ownership and operation of apartment communities since that time. As of
December 31, 2003, we had 1,622 employees.

ITEM 2.

COMMUNITIES

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment
communities, communities in various stages of development (“Development
Communities”) and Development Rights as defined below. Our current operating
communities are further distinguished as Established Communities, Other
Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up Communities and Redevelopment Communities.
The following is a description of each category:

Current Communities

are categorized as Established, Other
Stabilized, Lease-Up, or Redevelopment according to the following
attributes:

•

Established Communities

(also known as Same Store
Communities) are communities where a comparison of
operating results from the prior year to the current year
is meaningful, as these communities were owned and had
stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the
beginning of the prior year. We determine which of our
communities fall into the Established Communities category
annually as of January 1st of each year and maintain that
classification throughout the year. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Established Communities are
communities that had stabilized occupancy and operating
expenses as of January 1, 2002 and are not conducting or
planning to conduct substantial redevelopment activities,
as described below, and are not held for sale or planned
for disposition within the current year. We consider a
community to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of
(i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the
one-year anniversary of completion of development or
redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all other
completed communities that have stabilized occupancy, as
defined above. Other Stabilized Communities do not
include communities that are conducting or planning to
conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the
current year.


•

Lease-Up Communities

are communities where
construction has been complete for less than one year and
where physical occupancy has not reached 95%.

•

Redevelopment Communities

are communities where
substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to
begin during the current year. Redevelopment is
considered substantial when capital invested during the
reconstruction effort exceeds the lesser of $5,000,000 or
10% of the community’s acquisition cost.

Development Communities

are communities that are under
construction and for which a final certificate of occupancy has
not been received. These communities may be partially complete
and operating.

Development Rights

are development opportunities in the
early phase of the development process for which we either have an
option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, for
which we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to
purchase land or where we own land to develop a new community. We
capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of
new developments for which we currently believe future development
is probable.

As of December 31, 2003, our communities were classified as follows:

Current Communities

The Current Communities are primarily garden-style apartment communities
consisting of two and three-story buildings in landscaped settings. The
Current Communities, as of February 27, 2004, include 98 garden-style (of
which 10 are mixed communities and include townhomes), 19 high-rise and 14
mid-rise apartment communities. The Current Communities offer many attractive
amenities including some or all of the following:

•

vaulted ceilings;

•

lofts;

•

fireplaces;

•

patios/decks; and

•

modern appliances.

Other features at various communities may include:

•

swimming pools;

•

fitness centers;

•

tennis courts; and

•

business centers.

We also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to keep all
communities and apartment homes substantially free of deferred maintenance and,
where vacant, available for immediate occupancy. We believe that the aesthetic
appeal of our communities and a service oriented property management team,
focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal to
discriminating residents. We believe this will ultimately achieve higher
rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and
operating expenses.


These Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:

We manage and operate all of the Current Communities. During the year ended
December 31, 2003, we completed construction of 1,959 apartment homes in seven
communities and sold 3,634 apartment homes in twelve communities. The average
age of the Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number
of apartment homes, is 8.1 years.

Of the Current Communities, as of February 27, 2004, we own:

•

a fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in 104
operating communities;

•

a fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest in four
operating communities which are on land subject to land
leases expiring in January 2062, April 2095, May 2099 and
March 2142;

•

a general partnership interest in three partnerships
that each own a fee simple interest in an operating
community;

•

a general partnership interest in five partnerships
structured as “DownREITs,” as described more fully below,
that own an aggregate of 15 communities;

•

a membership interest in four limited liability
companies that each hold a fee simple interest in an
operating community, two of which are on land subject to land
leases with one lease expiring in July 2029 and one lease
expiring in November 2089; and


•

a 100% interest in a senior participating mortgage note
secured by one community, which allows us to share in part
of the rental income or resale proceeds of the community.

We also hold a fee simple ownership interest in nine of the Development
Communities, a membership interest in a limited liability company that owns one
Development Community and a general partnership interest in a partnership
structured as a “DownREIT” that owns one Development Community.

In each of our six partnerships structured as DownREITs, either AvalonBay or
one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there are one
or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is represented by
units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT partnership, limited
partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any
distribution is made to the general partner. Although the partnership
agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the distributions
per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests have
approximated our current common stock dividend amount. Each DownREIT
partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely the limited partners
will be entitled to a distribution greater than the initial distribution
provided for in the applicable partnership agreement. The holders of units of
limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of limited
partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market value of
a share of our common stock on the date of redemption. In lieu of a cash
redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for
redemption for one share of our common stock or for such cash amount. As of
February 27, 2004, there were 589,412 DownREIT partnership units outstanding.
The DownREIT partnerships are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Development Communities

As of February 27, 2004, we had eleven Development Communities under
construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add
a total of 3,493 apartment homes to our portfolio for a total capital cost,
including land acquisition costs, of approximately $671,900,000. Statements
regarding the future development or performance of the Development Communities
are forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will complete the Development Communities;

•

our budgeted costs or estimates of occupancy rates will be realized;

•

our schedule of leasing start dates, construction completion
dates or stabilization dates will be achieved; or

•

future developments will realize returns comparable to our
past developments.

You should carefully review the discussion under “Risks of Development and
Redevelopment” included elsewhere in this Item 2.


The following table presents a summary of the Development Communities. We hold
a direct or indirect fee simple ownership interest in these communities except
where noted.

Redevelopment Communities

As of February 27, 2004, we had two communities under redevelopment. We expect
the total capital cost to complete these communities, including the cost of
acquisition, capital expenditures subsequent to acquisition and redevelopment,
to be approximately $203,800,000, of which approximately $34,200,000 is the
additional capital invested or expected to be invested during redevelopment and
$5,800,000 has been invested since acquisition unrelated to redevelopment.
Statements regarding the future redevelopment or performance of the
Redevelopment Communities are forward-looking statements. We have found that
the cost to redevelop an existing apartment community is more difficult to
budget and estimate than the cost to develop a new community. Accordingly, we
expect that actual costs may vary from our budget by a wider range than for a
new development community. We cannot assure you that we will meet our
schedules for reconstruction completion or restabilized operations, or that we
will meet our budgeted costs, either individually or in the aggregate. See the
discussion under “Risks of Development and Redevelopment” included elsewhere in
this report.

Restabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 95% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion

Development Rights

As of February 27, 2004, we are considering the development of 40 new apartment
communities on land that is either owned by us, under contract, subject to a
leasehold interest or for which we hold a purchase option. We generally hold
Development Rights through options to acquire land, although for 10 of the
Development Rights we currently own the land on which a community would be
built if we proceeded with development. The Development Rights range from
those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed
site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We
estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would
ultimately add 10,070 apartment homes to our portfolio.
Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those
offered by the communities we currently own. At December 31, 2003, there were
cumulative capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related
overhead costs, but excluding land costs) of $31,334,000 relating to
Development Rights. In addition, land costs related to the pursuit of
Development Rights (consisting of original land and additional carrying costs)
of $81,358,000 are reflected as land held for development on the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2003.

The properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the
due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of
the Development Rights to pursue, if any, or to continue to pursue once an
investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make
after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that
we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover
capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were
to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot
guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of
Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable
are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right
changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any capitalized
pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense.


Because we intend to limit the percentage of debt used to finance new
developments, other financing alternatives may be required to help finance the
development of those Development Rights scheduled to start construction after
January 1, 2004.

Although the development of any particular Development Right cannot be assured,
we believe that the Development Rights, in the aggregate, present attractive
potential opportunities for future development and growth of long-term
stockholder value.

Statements regarding the future development of the Development Rights are
forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that:

•

we will succeed in obtaining zoning and other necessary
governmental approvals or the financing required to develop these
communities, or that we will decide to develop any particular
community; or

•

if we undertake construction of any particular community,
that we will complete construction at the total capital cost assumed
in the financial projections in the following table.

Risks of Development and Redevelopment

We intend to continue to pursue the development and redevelopment of apartment
home communities. Our development and redevelopment activities may be exposed
to the following:

•

we may abandon opportunities we have already begun to explore
based on further review of, or changes in, financial, demographic,
environmental or other factors;

•

we may encounter liquidity constraints, including the
unavailability of financing on favorable terms for the development
or redevelopment of a community;

•

we may be unable to obtain, or we may experience delays in
obtaining, all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and
other required governmental permits and authorizations;

•

we may incur construction or reconstruction costs for a
community that exceed our original estimates due to increased
materials, labor or other expenses, which could make completion of
development or redevelopment of the community uneconomical;

•

occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed development or
redevelopment community may fluctuate depending on a number of
factors, including competition and market and general economic
conditions, and may not be sufficient to make the community
profitable; and

•

we may be unable to complete construction and lease-up on
schedule, resulting in increased debt service expense and
construction costs.

The occurrence of any of the events described above could adversely affect
results of operations and our payment of distributions to our stockholders.

Construction costs are projected by us based on market conditions prevailing in
the community’s market at the time our budgets are prepared and reflect changes
to those market conditions that we anticipated at that time. Although we
attempt to anticipate changes in market conditions, we cannot predict those
changes with certainty. Construction costs have been increasing and, for some
of our Development Communities, the total construction costs have been or are
expected to be higher than the original budget. Total capital cost includes
all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective
Development or Redevelopment Community, determined in accordance with GAAP,
including:

•

land and/or property acquisition costs;

•

construction or reconstruction costs;

•

real estate taxes;

•

capitalized interest;

•

loan fees;

•

permits;

•

professional fees;

•

allocated development or redevelopment overhead; and

•

other regulatory fees.

Costs to redevelop communities that have been acquired have, in some cases,
exceeded our original estimates and similar increases in costs may be
experienced in the future. We cannot assure you that market rents in effect at
the time new development communities or redevelopment communities complete
lease-up will be sufficient to fully offset the effects of any increased
construction or reconstruction costs.


Capitalized Interest

In accordance with GAAP, we capitalize interest expense during construction or
reconstruction until a building obtains a certificate of occupancy. Interest
that is incurred thereafter and allocated to a completed apartment home within
the community is expensed. Capitalized interest during the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2002 totaled $24,709,000 and $29,937,000, respectively.

Recent Developments

Sales of Existing Communities.

We seek to increase our geographical
concentration in selected high barrier-to-entry markets where we believe we
can:

•

apply sufficient market and management presence to enhance revenue growth;

•

reduce operating expenses; and

•

leverage management talent.

To achieve this increased concentration, we (i) sell assets that do not meet
our long-term investment strategy due to product type, location or relative
potential for future appreciation and (ii) redeploy the proceeds from those
sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such
redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these
communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our variable rate unsecured
credit facility. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of
communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a nontaxable, like-kind
exchange transaction. We sold twelve communities, totaling 3,634 apartment
homes, during the period from January 1, 2003 through February 27, 2004. Net
proceeds from the sale of these assets were $396,518,000.

Land Acquisitions

. We carefully select land for development and follow
established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of
development. During 2003, we acquired four land parcels for an aggregate
purchase price of $17,730,000. The land parcels purchased, which are currently
held for future development, are as follows:

Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses

We carry commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with
respect to all of our communities. These policies, and other insurance
policies we carry, have policy specifications, insured limits and deductibles
that we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of
losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full
or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes
it, in management’s view, economically impractical. If an uninsured property
loss or a property loss in excess of insured limits were to occur, we could
lose our capital invested in a community, as well as the anticipated future
revenues from such community. We would also continue to be obligated to repay
any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community. If an
uninsured liability to a third party were to occur, we would incur the cost of
defense and settlement with, or court ordered damages to, that third party. A
significant uninsured property or liability loss could materially and adversely
affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations.

Many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of
active earthquake faults. A large concentration of our communities lie near,
and thus are susceptible to, the major fault lines in the San Francisco Bay
Area, including the San Andreas fault and the Hayward fault. We cannot assure
you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than insured
levels. In July 2003, we renewed our earthquake insurance. We have in place
with respect to communities located in California, for any single occurrence
and in the aggregate, $75,000,000 of coverage with a deductible per building
equal to five percent of the insured value of that building. The five percent
deductible is subject to a minimum of $100,000 per occurrence. Earthquake
coverage outside of California is subject to a $75,000,000 limit, except with
respect to the state of Washington, for which the limit is $65,000,000. Our
earthquake insurance outside of California provides for a $100,000 deductible
per occurrence. In addition, up to an annual aggregate of $2,000,000, the next
$400,000 of loss per occurrence outside California will be treated as an
additional deductible.

Our annual general liability policy and workman’s compensation coverage was
renewed on August 1, 2003. Although the insurance coverage provided for in the
renewal policies did not materially change from the preceding year, the level
of our deductible and premium costs has increased. Including the costs we
estimate that we may incur as a result of deductibles, we expect the cost
related to these insurance categories for the policy period from August 1, 2003
to July 31, 2004 to increase approximately $500,000 as compared to the prior
period.

Our property insurance policy was scheduled to renew on November 1, 2003;
however, in an effort to capitalize on declining insurance rates we elected to
renew effective July 31, 2003 with an expiration date of February 1, 2005.
Based on this renewal, we have seen a decline in insurance premiums
for property coverage, which
combined with the cost we may incur as a result of deductibles, will result in
flat or declining overall insurance costs as compared to prior periods.

Just as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings,
there have been recent reports that apartment communities could become targets
of terrorism. In November 2002, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act (“TRIA”) which is designed to make terrorism insurance available. In
connection with this legislation, we have purchased insurance for property
damage due to terrorism up to $200,000,000. Additionally, we have purchased
insurance for certain terrorist acts, not covered under TRIA, such as
domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified”
terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits and exclusions. Our
general liability policy provides TRIA coverage (subject to deductibles and
insured limits) for liability to third parties that result from terrorist acts
at our communities.

Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on
building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered
or is not addressed over a period of time. Although the occurrence of mold at
multifamily and other structures, and the need to remediate such mold, is not a
new phenomenon, there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain
molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic
or other reactions. To help limit mold growth, we educate residents about the
importance of adequate ventilation and request or require that they notify us
when they see mold or excessive moisture. We have established procedures for
promptly addressing and remediating mold or excessive moisture from apartment
homes when we become aware of its presence regardless of whether we or the
resident believe a health risk is present.


However, we cannot assure that
mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner.
If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be
required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the
mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. We
cannot assure that we will have coverage under our existing policies for
property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure
to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.

In March 2003, we renewed our Directors and Officers ("D&O") insurance.
Since then, we have noted an increase in competition from new carriers entering the market and expanded capital
capacity of existing carriers, resulting in a partial reversal of the significant premium increases experienced
in recent years. We are currently renewing our coverage for the year beginning March 10, 2004 and expect our
premium to decline approximately 10% to 12% from the prior coverage period. However, there can be
no assurance that we will be able to renew on such favorable terms.

Americans with Disabilities Act

The apartment communities we own and any apartment communities that we acquire
must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the extent
that such properties are “public accommodations” and/or “commercial facilities”
as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with the
Americans with Disabilities Act requirements could require removal of
structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of our
properties where such removal is readily achievable. The Americans with
Disabilities Act does not, however, consider residential properties, such as
apartment communities, to be public accommodations or commercial facilities,
except to the extent portions of such facilities, such as leasing offices, are
open to the public. We believe our properties comply in all material respects
with all present requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act and
applicable state laws. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines or an
award of damages to private litigants.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these claims and
proceedings are expected to be covered by liability insurance. The following
matter, for which, based on the advice of counsel, we believe we have
meritorious defenses and are therefore vigorously defending against, is not
covered by liability insurance. However, outstanding litigation matters,
individually and in the aggregate, including the matter described below, are
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial
condition.

We are currently involved in litigation with York Hunter Construction, Inc. and
National Union Fire Insurance Company. The action arises from our October 1999
termination of York Hunter as construction manager under a
contract relating to construction of the Avalon Willow community in Mamaroneck,
New York, because of alleged failures and deficiencies by York Hunter and its
subcontractors in performing under the contract. York Hunter initiated the
litigation in October 1999 by filing a complaint against us and other
defendants claiming more than $7,000,000 in damages. We have filed
counterclaims against York Hunter seeking more than $7,000,000 in compensatory
damages, including lost rental income and costs to complete the community. We
have also filed a claim against National Union Fire Insurance, which furnished
construction and performance bonds to us on behalf of York Hunter. Although no
assurances can be made with respect to any litigation, based on the advice of
our counsel in this matter, Wachtel & Masyr LLP, we believe that we have
meritorious defenses against all of York Hunter’s claims and are vigorously
contesting those claims. We also are pursuing our counterclaims against York
Hunter and National Union Fire Insurance aggressively. A non-jury trial
commenced on April 29, 2003 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of Westchester and is on-going at this time. While the outcome of such
litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current
litigation, including the litigation with York Hunter and National Union, to
have a material effect on our business or financial condition.

We expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.
However, dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board
of Directors and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial
condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the
REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and other factors as the Board of
Directors may consider relevant. The Board of Directors may modify our
dividend policy from time to time.

During the three months ended December 31,
  2003, we issued 145,700 shares of common stock in exchange for 145,700 units
  of limited partnership held by certain limited partners of Avalon DownREIT V,
  L.P., Avalon Upper Falls, L.P. and Bay Pacific Northwest, L.P. These shares
  were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section 4(2)
  of the Securities Act of 1933. We are relying on the exemption based on factual
  representations received from the limited partners who received these shares.

Notes to Selected Financial Data

(1)

In 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission clarified Emerging Issues
      Task Force Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per
      Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock.”
      The clarification of Topic D-42 was effective in the first fiscal period
      ending after September 15, 2003, and was to be applied retroactively. As
      such, we have revised our historical 2001 results of operations to reflect
      the initial offering costs as additional dividends attributable to preferred
      stock in the amount of $7,538, which reduced earnings per common share —
      basic and earnings per common share — diluted by $0.11 and $0.10, respectively.

(2)

EBITDA is defined by us as net income before interest income and expense,
      income taxes, depreciation and amortization from both continuing and discontinued
      operations. Under this definition, which complies with the rules and regulations
      of the Securities and Exchange Commission, EBITDA includes gains on sale
      of assets and gain on sale of partnership interests. Management generally
      considers EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income
      of our operating performance because it helps investors to understand our
      ability to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. EBITDA
      should not be considered as an alternative to net income (as determined
      in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”),
      as an indicator of our operating performance, or to cash flows from operating
      activities (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity.
      Our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to EBITDA as calculated
      by other companies.

(3)

We generally consider Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” to be
      an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance
      because, by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of property
      and excluding real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical
      assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful
      life estimates, FFO can help one compare the operating performance of a
      company’s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies.
      We believe that in order to understand our operating results, FFO should
      be examined with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements
      of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this
      report. Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors
      of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts®, (“NAREIT”),
      we calculate FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP,
      adjusted for:

•

gains or losses on sales of property;

•

extraordinary gains or losses (as defined by GAAP);

•

depreciation of real estate assets; and

•

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.


Effective January 1, 2003, we no longer add back impairment losses
when calculating FFO pursuant to NAREIT’s clarified FFO definition.
As a result, FFO for 2002 has been reduced from amounts previously
reported to reflect $6,800 of asset impairment losses recognized in
2002. In addition, FFO for 2001 has been reduced from amounts
previously reported to reflect the inital
 offering costs as additional dividends attributable to preferred stock as discussed in note (1) above.
FFO does not represent net income in accordance
with GAAP, and therefore it should not be considered an alternative to
net income, which remains the primary measure, as an indication of our
performance. In addition, FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be
comparable to our calculation of FFO. The following is a
reconciliation of net income to FFO:

  cash flow metrics is provided in “Cash Flow Information” in the

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We are a real estate investment trust, or REIT, incorporated in the state of
Maryland and focused on the ownership and operation of apartment communities in
high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. As of December 31, 2003,
we had 131 current operating communities, which are the primary contributors to
our overall operating performance. The net operating income of these
communities, which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate
community performance, is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our
markets, which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels, and is affected by
our ability to control operating costs. Our overall operating performance is
also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the
performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities. We
create long-term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective
terms, deploying that capital to develop, redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier-to-entry
markets, operating apartments and selling communities when they no longer meet
our long-term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable.

This report, including the following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations, contains forward-looking statements that
predict or indicate future events and trends that do not report historical
matters. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those
projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors set forth on page
54 of this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
Consolidated Financial Statements and notes included elsewhere in this report.

Business Description and Community Information Overview

We believe that apartment communities present an attractive long-term
investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a
broad potential resident base should result in relatively stable demand over a
real estate cycle. We intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in
markets where constraints to new supply exist, and where new household
formations are expected to out-pace multifamily permit activity over the course
of the real estate cycle. Barriers-to-entry in our markets generally include a
difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense
urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply. We
evaluate the appropriate allocation of product type within our individual
markets, which are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific
Northwest, and Northern and Southern California regions of the United States,
to ensure that our product mix will perform at a high level and achieve our
portfolio objectives. Our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a
broad range of products (which is currently primarily upscale apartment
communities) and services, with an intense focus on our customer. A
substantial majority of our current communities are upscale (commanding among
the highest rents in their submarkets). We also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment
communities that target a variety of customer segments and price
points consistent with our goal to offer a broad range of products
and services. We
believe that lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of
apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and
larger increases in cash flows relative to other markets over an entire
business cycle.

However, we believe we are toward the end of a period of the business cycle
where rents have been resetting to lower levels, resulting in a decline in cash
flows in 2003 as compared to prior years. A number of our markets experienced
economic contraction due to job losses in 2002 and 2003, particularly in the
technology, telecom and financial services sectors. This has resulted in
continued weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental
rates. However, the rate of decline has been diminishing, and we expect 2004
to be a year of transition. An improving economy with modest job growth is
anticipated in 2004, which should result in the stabilization of apartment
market fundamentals and an improved demand and supply balance during the year.
Although we do not expect this to result in revenue growth for our current
operating communities in 2004, it should curtail the significant declines in
revenue that those communities experienced over the last two years.


With the expected transition of apartment fundamentals, we are preparing for a
transition in certain aspects of our business activity. With our in-house
capabilities and expertise we believe we are well positioned to continue to
pursue opportunities to develop, acquire and operate apartment homes in our
target markets. However, the level of development or acquisition volume, or
disposition activity, is heavily influenced by capital and real estate market
conditions. During 2003, in response to capital markets conditions and strong
apartment demand, we curtailed development and acquisition activity and
increased our disposition activity. We sold assets that did not meet our
long-term investment criteria in markets where there was strong relative demand
by investors in apartment communities. This allowed us to realize a portion of
the value created over the past business cycle, and provided additional
liquidity. In 2004, we plan to continue our disposition activity, although at
a reduced level, and expect to increase development and acquisition volume.

Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating
apartment communities, communities in various stages of development
(“Development Communities”), and Development Rights (i.e., land or land
options held for development), as further described in Item 2 of this
report. Our current operating communities are further distinguished as
Established Communities, Other Stabilized Communities, Lease-Up
Communities and Redevelopment Communities. Established Communities are
generally operating communities that were owned and had stabilized
occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year, which allows
the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are
located to be compared and monitored between years. Other Stabilized
Communities are generally all other operating communities that have
stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year,
but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior
year. Lease-Up Communities consist of communities where construction is
complete but stabilization has not been achieved. Redevelopment
Communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in
progress or is planned to begin during the current year. A more
detailed description of our reportable segments and other related
operating information can be found in Note 9, “Segment Reporting,” of
our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although each of these categories is important to our business, we
generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based
on the operating results of Established Communities, for which a
detailed discussion can be found in “Results of Operations” as part of
our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current
and future cash needs and future operating potential based on
acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing
activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development
Communities, for which detailed discussions can be found in “Liquidity
and Capital Resources.”

As of December 31, 2003, we owned or held an ownership interest in 142
apartment communities containing 41,997 apartment homes in ten states
and the District of Columbia, of which eleven communities were under
construction and two communities were under reconstruction. In
addition, we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in
Development Rights to develop an additional 40 communities that, if
developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 10,070
apartment homes.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to use judgment in the
application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.
If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to
various transactions had been different, it is possible that different
accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in a different
presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of accounting
policies that we consider critical, in that they may require complex judgment
in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently
uncertain, and are critical to an understanding of our financial condition and
operating results. As a REIT that owns, operates and develops apartment
communities, our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition,
cost capitalization, asset impairment evaluation and REIT status. A discussion
of all of our accounting policies, including further discussion of the critical
accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, “Organization and
Significant Accounting Policies” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.


Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from
residents in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13,
“Accounting for Leases.” In accordance with our standard lease terms, rental
payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash concessions given at
the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease
– generally one year. A discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on
rental revenue for Established Communities can be found in “Results of
Operations.”

Cost Capitalization

We capitalize costs during the development of assets (including interest and
related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs)
beginning when active development commences until the asset, or a portion of
the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is generally
indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. We capitalize costs
during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and related loan
fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) beginning when an
apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment until the apartment
home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new
resident.

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights
for which we currently believe future development is probable. These costs
include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development
of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning
and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and
availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of
Development Rights for which future development is not yet considered probable
are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right
changes, deeming future development no longer probable, any capitalized
pre-development costs are written-off with a charge to expense.

We generally capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. We capitalize
improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $15,000; (ii) extends
the useful life of the asset; and (iii) is not related to making an apartment
home ready for the next resident. Under this policy, virtually all capitalized
costs are non-recurring, as recurring make-ready costs are expensed as
incurred. Recurring make-ready costs include: (i) carpet and appliance
replacements; (ii) floor coverings; (iii) interior painting; and (iv) other
redecorating costs. Because we expense carpet replacements, our expense levels and
volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year following our peak
summer leasing period. We capitalize purchases of personal property, such as
computers and furniture, only if the item is a new addition and the item
exceeds $2,500. We generally expense replacements of personal property.

In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the amounts capitalized (excluding land costs) related
to acquisitions, development and redevelopment were $296,764,000, $457,851,000
and $401,359,000, respectively. For Established and Other Stabilized
Communities, we recorded non-revenue generating capital expenditures of
$11,064,000 or $333 per apartment home in 2003, $10,214,000 or $302 per
apartment home in 2002 and $7,967,000 or $251 per apartment home in 2001. In
addition, revenue generating capital expenditures, such as water sub-metering
equipment and cable installations, were $529,000, $697,000 and $1,675,000, in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The average maintenance costs charged to
expense per apartment home, including carpet and appliance replacements,
related to these communities was $1,262 in 2003, $1,224 in 2002 and
$1,196 in
2001. We anticipate that capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per
apartment home will gradually increase as the average age of our communities
increases, and expensed maintenance costs will fluctuate with turnover.


Asset Impairment Evaluation

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in
the value of a community, our policy is to assess the impairment by making a
comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the community
over its remaining useful life, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
amount of the community. If the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated
projected operating cash flows of the community, we would recognize an
impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount
to its estimated fair market value. Real estate assets held for sale are
measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to
sell.

We account for our investments in technology companies in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of
Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” If there is an event or change in
circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment, we record the
loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. Due to the
nature of these investments, an impairment in value can be difficult to
determine.

REIT Status

We elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and have not revoked such
election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests
and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be
subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute
currently to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable
year, we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to
qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years.


Results of Operations

Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in
net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to
market conditions, net operating income derived from acquisitions and

Net income available to common stockholders

increased $105,059,000 (67.5%) to $260,781,000 for the year ended December 31,
  2003. This increase is primarily attributable to gains on sales of communities,
  including gains reflected in equity in income of unconsolidated entities, and
  the absence of impairment losses in 2003, partially offset by a decline in net
  operating income from our Established Communities, the absence of business interruption
  insurance proceeds received in 2002 and increases in interest and depreciation
  expense. Net income available to common stockholders decreased by $53,240,000
  (25.5%) to $155,722,000 in 2002 due to fewer gains on sales of communities in
  2002 and impairment losses recognized in 2002, coupled with a decline in net
  operating income from our Established Communities and increases in
interest and depreciation, partially offset by a decrease in dividends attributable to preferred stock.


Net operating income

(“NOI”) is defined by us as total revenue less direct
property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excludes
corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses,
interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, impairment
losses, equity in income of unconsolidated entities, minority interest in
consolidated partnerships, venture partner interest in profit-sharing,
depreciation expense, gain on sale of communities and income from discontinued
operations. We believe that NOI is an important and appropriate supplemental
measure to net income of the operating performance of our communities because
it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a
community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level costs.
This is more reflective of the operating performance of a community, and allows
for an easier comparison of the operating performance of single assets or
groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have
different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by
acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to
be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group
of assets. NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in
accordance with GAAP. Therefore, NOI should not be considered an alternative
to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be
considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as
determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A calculation of
NOI for the three years ending December 31, 2003, along with a reconciliation
to net income, is provided in the preceding table.

The NOI decreases of
$1,519,000 and $15,893,000 for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, as compared to the prior years consist of
changes in the following categories:

The NOI decreases in Established Communities
  were largely due to the effects of the weakened economy in many of our submarkets.
  The continued impact of job losses in many of our submarkets, in addition to
  strong single-family home sales, have aggravated a weak demand environment,
  causing market rental rates to decline in order to keep occupancies stable.
  Economic forecasts project modest job growth in our submarkets in 2004, and
  we therefore expect apartment market fundamentals to stabilize during the year.
  Although the rate of decline in the apartment market fundamentals is diminishing,
  which should curtail the significant declines in revenue that our Established
  Communities have experienced over the last two years, we expect our Established
  Communities revenue to decline as much as 2.0% in 2004 as compared to 2003 and
  operating expenses, particularly related to property taxes, to continue to increase
  up to 3.0% in 2004, resulting in continued year over year declines in our Established
  Communities NOI of up to 4.0% for 2004.

Rental and other income

increased
  in both 2003 and 2002 due to rental income generated from communities acquired
  in 2002 and newly developed communities, partially offset by declines in effective
  rental rates and business interruption proceeds. While we expect apartment fundamentals
  to stabilize in 2004 with modest job growth in our markets, there is typically
  a three to six month lag between improvements in job growth and improvements
  in operating performance.


Overall Portfolio –
  The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to 33,842
  apartment homes for 2003 as compared to 31,694 apartment homes for 2002 and
  31,131 in 2001. This change is primarily the result of increased homes available
  from communities acquired in 2002 and newly developed communities, partially
  offset by communities sold in 2002 and 2003. The weighted average monthly revenue
  per occupied apartment home decreased to $1,496 in 2003 as compared to $1,528
  in 2002 and $1,550 in 2001 primarily due to the weakened demand in certain of
  our submarkets.

Established Communities
  – Rental revenue decreased $20,424,000 (4.3%) in 2003 and $28,400,000 (6.2%)
  in 2002. These decreases are due to declining effective rental rates, partially
  offset by a slight increase in economic occupancy in 2003. For 2003, the weighted
  average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home decreased (4.5%) to $1,437
  compared to $1,505 for 2002, partially due to increased concessions granted
  in the latter half of 2002 and during 2003. The average economic occupancy increased
  from 93.6% in 2002 to 93.8% in 2003. Economic occupancy takes into account the
  fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community
  have different economic impacts on a community’s gross revenue. Economic
  occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage
  of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing
  occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. We expect rental income for Established Communities
  to decline as much as 2.0% in 2004 as compared to 2003.

Although most of our markets have experienced weak demand caused by job losses,
low mortgage rates and shifting demographics, rental income from Established
Communities has been impacted the most by significant declines in average
rental rates in certain Northern California and Northeast submarkets. Northern
California, which accounted for approximately 31.0% of Established Community
rental revenue in 2003, experienced a decline in rental revenue (7.6%) in 2003
as compared to 2002, partially related to the continued impact of job losses in
the technology sector. Although economic occupancy in Northern California
increased in 2003 as compared to 2002, average rental rates dropped 8.9% from
$1,547 to $1,410.

The Northeast region accounted for approximately 33.7% of Established Community
rental revenue during 2003 and has also experienced a decline in rental revenue
(3.7%) in 2003 as compared to 2002, primarily the result of job losses in the
financial services sector. Average rental rates dropped 3.6% from $1,876 to
$1,808 in 2003 as compared to 2002, and economic occupancy remained flat during
those same periods.

In accordance with GAAP, cash concessions
  are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term,
  which is generally one year. However, we consider rental revenue with concessions
  stated on a cash basis to be a supplemental measure to rental revenue in conformity
  with GAAP in helping investors to evaluate the impact of both current and historical
  concessions on GAAP based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons
  to revenue as reported by other companies. In addition, rental revenue with
  concessions stated on a cash basis allows an investor to understand the historical
  trend in cash concessions, which is an indicator of current rental market conditions.
  The following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with GAAP
  to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our
  Established Communities for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
  (dollars in thousands). Information for the year ended December 31, 2001 is not
  presented as Established Community classification is not applicable prior to
  January 1, 2002. See Note 9. “Segment Reporting” of our Consolidated
  Financial Statements.

Concessions granted per move-in for Established Communities averaged $848
during 2003, an increase of 104.8% from $414 in 2002. Concessions granted
increased during 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to declining market
conditions and a weak demand environment. We expect the high concessionary
environment to continue into 2004.

Management, development and other fees

decreased during 2003 and increased
during 2002 primarily due to the recognition in 2002 of $711,000 in
construction management fees in connection with the redevelopment of a
community owned by a limited liability company in which we have a membership
interest. In addition, we managed fewer communities in 2003 as compared to
prior years.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes

increased in both
2003 and 2002 due to the addition of recently developed and redeveloped
apartment homes and communities acquired in 2002, coupled with increased
expenses due to inclement weather, insurance and bad debt expenses. In the
first half of 2003, severe winter weather, primarily in the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, increased snow removal and utility costs by approximately
$1,440,000. In addition, insurance expense has increased over the past two
years as the insurance and reinsurance markets have deteriorated, resulting in
higher insurance costs for the entire real estate sector. Recently property
insurance rates began to decline. To benefit from declining rates, we
completed an early renewal of our property insurance policy effective July 31,
2003. Accordingly, we expect a decline in property insurance premiums, which
will result in flat or declining overall insurance costs for 2004 as compared
to prior year periods. Bad debt expense has increased as a direct result of
the continued impact of job losses and the weakened economy.

For Established Communities, direct property operating
expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $5,724,000 (6.1%) to $99,853,000 in 2003
due to inclement weather, insurance and bad
debt discussed above. During 2002, operating expenses increased
$5,227,000 (6.5%) due to the increases in insurance, marketing and bad
debt expenses. We expect expense growth to moderate in 2004 due to reduced property insurance costs and
bad debt expenses.

Property taxes

increased in both 2003 and 2002 due to overall higher
assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment
homes.

For Established Communities, property taxes increased
in 2003 and 2002 by $1,470,000 and $879,000, respectively, primarily due to higher
assessments throughout all regions. We expect property taxes to
increase during 2004 as local jurisdictions look for additional revenue
sources to balance budgets. We manage property tax increases internally
and appeal increases when appropriate.

Corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses

increased in 2003 as a result of increased legal expenses due to construction
litigation relating to a community that has completed development, partially
offset by the absence of costs associated with the implementation of a new
property management leasing system in 2002 and a decrease in abandoned pursuit
costs. During 2002, corporate-level property management and other indirect
operating expenses decreased as a result of executive separation costs that
were recognized in 2001 but not in 2002, partially offset by an increase in
abandoned pursuit costs. Abandoned pursuit costs related to Development Rights
which are not probable for future development decreased $1,620,000 from
$2,800,000 in 2002 to $1,180,000 in 2003. We expect corporate-level property
management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in 2004 due to
additional compensation costs, including growth due to the addition of newly
developed communities and the expensing of options.

Interest expense

increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily due to the issuance
in late 2002 of unsecured notes and higher average outstanding balances on our
unsecured credit facility, partially offset by the repayment of certain
unsecured notes and overall lower interest rates on both short-term and
long-term borrowings.


Depreciation expense

increased in both 2003 and 2002 primarily
due to 2002 acquisitions and completion of development or redevelopment activities.

General and administrative expense

(“G&A”) increased in 2003 primarily as a result of an increase
  in our directors and officers (“D&O”) insurance, which we renewed
  in March 2003. In the past year, the D&O market has experienced increased
  and high profile claim activity resulting in higher insurance premiums. G&A
  decreased in 2002 as a result of additional compensation expense recognized
  in 2001 due to the retirement of a senior executive. Unfilled positions and
  lower incentive compensation also contributed to the decrease in 2002. We expect
  G&A to increase up to 15.0% in 2004 due to higher compensation expense
  and additional internal audit and corporate governance costs.

Impairment loss

of $6,800,000 was recorded during 2002 related to two land
parcels that were determined not likely to proceed to development and therefore
were planned for disposition. No impairment losses were recorded in either
2003 or 2001.

Equity in income of unconsolidated
  entities

increased in 2003 primarily due to our $23,448,000 share of the
  gain recognized on the sale of a community accounted for under the equity method
  in which we held a 50% interest. During 2002, equity in income of unconsolidated
  entities decreased primarily due to losses recorded for an investment in a technology
  company accounted for under the equity method.

Interest income

decreased in 2003 and 2002 due to lower average cash balances
invested and lower interest rates.

Venture partner interest in profit-sharing

represents the income allocated to
our venture partner in a profit-sharing arrangement as discussed in Note 6,
“Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,” of our Consolidated Financial
Statements. The reduction in income/increase in expense in both years are due
to increases in the net income of the underlying real estate as the related
community moved out of the initial lease-up phase and achieved stabilization.

Income from discontinued operations

represents the net income generated by
communities held for sale as of December 31, 2003 and communities sold during
the period from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2003. The decreases in
both years are primarily due to the sale of one community in 2002 and eleven
communities in 2003.

Gain on sale of communities

, including discontinued operations, of
$160,990,000, $48,893,000 and $62,852,000 were realized in 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The amount of
gains realized depends on many factors, including the number of communities
sold, the size and carrying value of those communities and the market
conditions in the local area. The large gains on sales of communities reflect
our strategy to sell assets in a transactional market environment where buyers
are offering prices that are historically high relative to current operating
cash flow provided by these communities. We believe this is reflective of a
broader trend in the capital markets, where investments with relatively secure
yields and growth potential are being valued more highly than in prior years.
A partial reversal of these trends could occur if long-term interest rates rise
significantly. We expect aggregate gains on community sales to decline in 2004
as we sell fewer assets.

Dividends attributable to preferred
  stock

decreased in both 2003 and 2002, primarily as a result of several
  preferred stock redemptions during 2002 and 2003. In addition, in response to
  the Securities and Exchange Commission clarification of Emerging Issues Task
  Force (“EITF”)Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings
  per Share for the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock,”
  we have revised the presentation of our 2003 and 2001 operating results to include
  the initial offering costs as additional dividends of $280,000 and $7,538,000,
  respectively.


Funds from Operations

(“FFO”) is considered an appropriate supplemental measure
of our operating and financial performance because, by excluding gains or
losses related to dispositions of property and excluding real estate
depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar
condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, FFO
can help one compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate
between periods or as compared to different companies. We believe that in
order to understand our operating results, FFO should be examined with net
income as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. For a more detailed discussion
and presentation of FFO, see “Selected Financial Data,” included in Item 6 of this report.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations. Operating
cash flows have historically been determined by: (i) the number of apartment
homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels and (iv)
operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing, source and
amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing
activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment, particularly to
changes in interest rates. Changes in the capital markets environment, such as
changes in interest rates, affect our plans for development, redevelopment,
acquisition and disposition activity.

Cash and cash equivalents totaled $7,196,000 at December 31, 2003, a decrease
of $5,715,000 from $12,911,000 on December 31, 2002. The following discussion
relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing
activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities – Net cash provided by operating activities
decreased to $239,815,000 in 2003 from $307,810,000 in 2002, primarily
due to the absence of business interruption insurance proceeds and
changes in NOI from Established Communities as discussed earlier in
this report, coupled with the timing of payment of our property insurance premiums.

Investing Activities – Net cash provided by investing activities of
$33,935,000 in 2003 related to proceeds from asset dispositions,
partially offset by investments in assets through development and
redevelopment of apartment communities. During 2003, we invested
$369,387,000 in the purchase and development of real estate and capital
expenditures:

•

We began the development of seven new communities. These communities,
if developed as expected, will contain a total of 2,025 apartment
homes, and the total capital cost, including land acquisition costs,
is projected to be approximately $399,200,000. We also completed the
development of seven communities containing a total of 1,959 apartment
homes for a total capital cost, including land acquisition cost, of
$372,700,000.

•

We had capital expenditures relating to current communities’ real
estate assets of $11,593,000 and non-real estate capital expenditures
of $274,000.

In addition, we sold twelve communities and one land parcel in 2003,
including one community previously held through an equity investment,
generating net proceeds of $403,118,000. These proceeds are being used
to develop new communities and to partially repay amounts outstanding
under our variable rate unsecured credit facility, which is discussed
below.


Financing Activities – Net cash used in financing activities totaled
$279,465,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003, primarily due to the
redemption of preferred stock, dividends paid, repayment of certain
unsecured notes and common stock repurchases, partially offset by an
increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, the issuance
of mortgage notes payable and an issuance of common stock. See Note 3,
“Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes and Credit Facility,” and Note 4,
“Stockholders’ Equity,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements, for
additional information.

We regularly review our liquidity needs, the adequacy of cash flow from
operations, and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs. We
believe our principal short-term liquidity needs are to fund:

•

normal recurring operating expenses;

•

debt service and maturity payments;

•

preferred stock dividends and DownREIT partnership unit distributions;

•

the minimum dividend payments required to maintain
our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986;

•

opportunities for the acquisition of improved property; and

•

development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged.

We anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash
flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset dispositions and
borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

We have a $500,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with
J.P. Morgan Chase and Fleet National Bank serving as co-agents for a syndicate
of commercial banks. Under the terms of the credit facility, if we elect to
increase the facility by up to an additional $150,000,000, and one or more
banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) voluntarily agree to provide the
additional commitment, then we will be able to increase the facility up to
$650,000,000, and no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such
increase; such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent
banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to commit to lend additional
funds. We pay participating banks, in the aggregate, an annual facility fee of
approximately $750,000 in quarterly installments. The unsecured credit
facility bears interest at varying levels based on the London Interbank Offered
Rate (“LIBOR”), rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity
schedule selected by us. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per
annum (1.70% on February 27, 2004). Pricing could vary if there is a change in
rating by either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in
rating of one level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05%
to 0.15%. A competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to
$400,000,000. This option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium
to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing
provided by the unsecured credit facility. The competitive bid option may
result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. We had $125,000,000 outstanding
under this competitive bid option at February 27, 2004 priced at LIBOR plus 0.39%, or 1.48%.
We are subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility,
including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios, a
minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity
levels, and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed 95% of
our FFO, except as may be required to maintain our REIT status. The existing
facility matures in May 2004, unless we exercise a one-year renewal at our
option. We expect to renegotiate this facility prior to maturity without
exercising the renewal option, however there can be no assurance that the
renegotiation will occur. At February 27, 2004, $230,100,000 was outstanding,
$22,304,000 was used to provide letters of credit and $247,596,000 was
available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility.


Future Financing and Capital Needs – Debt Maturities

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of medium and
long-term debt at the time that such debt matures. For unsecured notes, we
anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be
repaid prior to maturity. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay
our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance
the debt. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or
public debt offerings, additional debt financing that is collateralized by
mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities, draws on our
unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings. We also
anticipate having retained cash flow available in each year so that when a debt
obligation matures, a portion of each maturity can be satisfied from this
retained cash. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our
long-term liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that additional debt financing
or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will
be on terms we consider satisfactory.

In February 2004, $125,000,000 in unsecured notes with an annual interest rate
of 6.58% matured and was repaid with proceeds drawn under our unsecured credit
facility. In addition, we repaid $11,381,000 in fixed rate mortgage
debt secured by a current community, along with any unpaid interest, prior to
its scheduled maturity of August 2004. No prepayment penalties were incurred.

Also in February 2004, we had credit enhancements, including interest rate
swaps, on approximately $87,380,000 of our variable rate, tax-exempt debt that
expired according to the original terms and that have not been extended.
However, we have replaced the credit enhancements on this debt, including
replacing the interest rate swaps with interest rate caps ranging from 6.7% to
9.0%. The underlying debt has a weighted average variable interest rate (exclusive of credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees’ fees, etc.)  of
0.9% as of February 27, 2004, which has been capped at a weighted average
interest rate of 7.6% through the interest rate caps. The credit enhancements,
including the interest rate caps, mature in 2014.

Future Financing and Capital Needs – Portfolio and Other Activity

As of December 31, 2003, we had eleven new communities under construction, for
which a total estimated cost of $221,629,000 remained to be invested. In
addition, we had two communities under reconstruction, for which a total
estimated cost of $5,660,000 remained to be invested. Substantially all of the
capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under
construction and reconstruction, as well as development costs related to
pursuing Development Rights, will be funded from:

•

the remaining capacity under our current $500,000,000 unsecured credit facility;

•

the net proceeds from sales of existing communities;

•

retained operating cash; and/or

•

the issuance of debt or equity securities.

Before planned reconstruction activity or the construction of a Development
Right begins, we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these
undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such
financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to
abandon Development Rights, write-off associated pre-development costs that
were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we
will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such
Development Rights.

We sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when
capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value
created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales
to develop and redevelop communities. We increased our disposition program
during 2003 to a level totaling $453,900,000. In response to real estate and
capital markets conditions, as well as strong institutional demand for product
in our markets, we plan to continue to sell communities into 2004, although at
reduced levels. However, we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be
sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will
continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy. Because the
proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into
revenue generating assets, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a
gain is to increase net income, but reduce total revenues, total expenses, NOI
and FFO.

We intend to engage in discussions with a limited number of institutional
investors regarding the possible formation of a discretionary fund that would
acquire and operate apartment communities. This fund would serve, for a period
of three years from the date of its final closing or until a significant
portion of its committed capital is invested, as the exclusive vehicle through
which we would acquire apartment communities, subject to certain exceptions
including, among others, significant individual asset and portfolio
acquisitions, properties acquired in tax-deferred transactions and acquisitions
that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund, if any. The fund would not
restrict our development activities, which would not be a part of the fund, and
would terminate after a term of eight years (subject to two one-year
extensions). We intend to actively pursue the formation of the fund, but there
can be no assurance as to when or if such a fund will be formed or, if formed,
what its size, terms or investment performance will be. We have preliminarily
targeted that the fund would have approximately $715,000,000 available for
investment (consisting of approximately $250,000,000 of fund equity, of which
we would commit approximately 20% of the total, and approximately $465,000,000
of debt financing).

We are also considering the use of several joint ventures, pursuant to which a
portion of future developments would be held through a partnership vehicle. We
generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate concentration or market
risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. Each joint venture or
partnership agreement will be individually negotiated, and our ability to
operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to
varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership
agreement. However, we cannot assure you that we will enter into joint
ventures in the future, or that, if we do, we will achieve our objectives.


We have minority interest investments in three technology companies, one of
which has a remaining unfunded commitment of $1,598,000, which we expect to be
released from without payment in the first quarter of 2004. We have no other
obligation to contribute additional funds to these technology investments.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

We own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities, with ownership
interests up to 50%. One of these unconsolidated real estate entities, Avalon
Terrace, LLC, has debt outstanding of $22,500,000 as of December 31, 2003,
which matures in 2005 and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity
with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate. We have not
guaranteed this debt, nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should
the unconsolidated real estate entity be unable to do so. There are no lines
of credit, side agreements, financial guarantees or any other derivative
financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real
estate entities. In evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage,
management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this
unconsolidated debt. For more information regarding the operations of our
unconsolidated entities see Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,”
of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations

We currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long-term
debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and office
space. Scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and
thereafter are as follows as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands):

Common and Preferred Stock Activity

Stock Repurchase Program

In 2002 our Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program,
under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or
negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program was designed so that
retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from sales of existing apartment
communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions, will provide the source of
funding for the program, with our unsecured credit facility providing temporary
funding as needed. Through February 27, 2004, we have acquired 2,380,600
shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $89,566,000 under this program.
We have not repurchased any shares of common stock since March 31, 2003.

Issuance of Common Stock

In August 2003, we completed a common stock offering totaling 2,804,700 shares
at a public offering price of
$46.00 per share. The net proceeds from this offering, after underwriting
discounts and commissions, of approximately $127,333,000 were used to repay a
portion of amounts outstanding on the unsecured credit facility and for general
corporate purposes.


Shelf Registration Statement

We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf registration statement
originally provided $750,000,000 of debt and equity capacity, however,
$127,333,000 has been utilized as a result of the common stock offering
described above. We cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt
or equity securities on cost-effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective
at all times.

Redemption of Preferred Stock

In March 2003, we redeemed all 3,267,700 outstanding shares of our 8.00% Series
D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, plus
$0.0167 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of
$81,747,000, including accrued dividends of $54,000. The redemption price was
funded by the sale of 3,336,611 shares of Series J Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock through a private placement to an institutional investor for a
net purchase price of $81,737,000. The dividend rate on such shares was
initially equal to 2.78% per annum (three-month LIBOR plus 1.5%) of the
liquidation preference. As permitted under the terms of such preferred stock,
we redeemed all of the Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in May
2003, for an aggregate redemption price of $82,207,000, including dividends of
$251,000.

We currently have the following series of redeemable preferred stock
outstanding at a stated value of $100,000,000. This series has no
stated maturity and is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory
redemptions.

Inflation and Deflation

Substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less.
In the event of significant inflation, this may enable us to realize increased
rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases.
Short-term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of
inflation, although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end
of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market
rents. In a deflationary rent environment, as is currently being experienced,
we are exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter-term leases.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined
under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify
forward-looking statements by our use of the words “believe,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “assume,” “project,” “plan,” “may,”
“shall,” “will”


and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict
or indicate future events and trends or that do not report historical matters.
These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent,
belief or expectations with respect to:

•

our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition
or disposition of communities;

•

the timing and cost of completion of apartment
communities under construction, reconstruction, development
or redevelopment;

•

the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;

•

the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;

•

the anticipated operating performance of our communities;

•

cost, yield and earnings estimates;

•

our declaration or payment of distributions;

•

our policies regarding investments, indebtedness,
acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters;

•

our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
Code;

•

the real estate markets in Northern and Southern
California and markets in selected states in the
Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, Midwest and Pacific Northwest
regions of the United States and in general;

•

the availability of debt and equity financing;

•

interest rates;

•

general economic conditions; and

•

trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in
these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current
expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. You should
not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.
These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results,
performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future
results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual
results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed
or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
the following:

•

we may fail to secure development opportunities due to
an inability to reach agreements with third parties or to
obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;

•

we may abandon or defer development opportunities for
a number of reasons, including changes in local market
conditions which make development less desirable, increases
in costs of development and increases in the cost of capital;

•

construction costs of a community may exceed our
original estimates;

•

we may not complete construction and lease-up of
communities under development or redevelopment on schedule,
resulting in increased interest expense and construction
costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;

•

occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely
affected by competition and local economic and market
conditions which are beyond our control;

•

financing may not be available on favorable terms or
at all, and our cash flow from operations and access to cost
effective capital may be insufficient for the development of
our pipeline which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;

•

our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required
payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to
refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such
refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
indebtedness; and

•

we may be unsuccessful in managing changes in our
portfolio composition.


These forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only
as of the date of this report. We do not undertake to update these
forward-looking statements, and you should not rely upon them after the date of
this report.

ITEM 7a.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to certain financial market risks, the most predominant being
fluctuations in interest rates. We monitor interest rate fluctuations as an
integral part of our overall risk management program, which recognizes the
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially
adverse effect on our results of operations. The effect of interest rate
fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting
operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy. The specific market
risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below.

Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of
borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as
outstanding bonds with variable interest rates. We had $168,505,000 and
$173,840,000 in variable rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100
basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002, our annual interest costs would
have increased by approximately $2,665,000 and $2,557,000, respectively, based
on balances outstanding during the applicable years.

We currently use interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest
rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness. Under swap
agreements:

•

we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would
have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest
rate (generally, the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on
the date the agreement is entered into, plus a fixed increment), and

•

the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would
have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed
floating interest rate tied to a particular market index.

As of December 31, 2003, the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest
rate on approximately $157,500,000 of our variable rate, tax-exempt debt.
Furthermore, a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on approximately
$22,500,000 of unconsolidated variable rate debt existed as of December 31,
2003. The swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate, tax-exempt debt
were not electively entered into by us but, rather, were a requirement of
either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of
our tax-exempt bond financings.
Because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial
institutions which have an A+ or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are
significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements, we do not
believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider.
Had these swap agreements not been in place during 2003 and 2002, our annual
interest costs would have been approximately $6,027,000 and $5,674,000 lower,
respectively, based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during
the applicable years. However, if the variable interest rates on this debt had
been 100 basis points higher throughout 2003 and 2002 and these swap agreements
had not been in place, our annual interest costs would have been approximately
$4,581,000 and $4,024,000 lower, respectively.

In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate
debt, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt
securities and notes payable (excluding our variable rate unsecured credit
facility) with an aggregate carrying value of $2,286,433,000 at December 31,
2003 had an estimated aggregate fair value of $2,555,733,000 at December 31,
2003. Fixed rate debt represented $2,169,028,000 of the carrying value and
$2,280,828,000 of the fair value at December 31, 2003. If interest rates had
been 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2003, the fair value of this
fixed rate debt would have decreased by $104,989,000.

Includes 91,838 deferred units granted under the 1994 Plan, which, subject
to vesting requirements, will convert in the future to common stock on a
one-for-one basis, but does not include 195,339 shares of restricted stock that
are outstanding and that are already reflected in the Company’s outstanding
shares.

(3)

Does not include outstanding options to acquire 473,962 shares, at a
weighted-average exercise price of $37.32 per share, that were assumed, in
connection with the 1998 merger of Avalon Properties, Inc. with and into the
Company, under the Avalon Properties, Inc. 1995 Equity Incentive Plan and the
Avalon Properties, Inc. 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan.

(4)

Excludes deferred units granted under the 1994 Plan, which, subject to
vesting requirements, will convert in the future to common stock on a
one-for-one basis.

(5)

The 1994 Plan incorporates an evergreen formula pursuant to which the
aggregate number of shares reserved for issuance under the 1994 Plan will
increase annually. On each January 1, the aggregate number of shares reserved
for issuance under the 1994 Plan will increase by a number of shares equal to a
percentage (ranging from 0.48% to 1.00%) of all outstanding shares of common
stock at the end of the year. The exact percentage used is determined based on
the percentage of all awards made under the 1994 Plan during the calendar year
that were in the form of stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair
market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. In
accordance with this procedure, on January 1, 2004, the maximum number of
shares remaining available for future issuance under the 1994 Plan was
increased by 622,657 to 2,981,050.

(6)

Consists of the ESPP.

The ESPP, which was adopted by the Board of Directors on October 29, 1996, has

Financial Statements included in this report.

Report of Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

AvalonBay Communities, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvalonBay
Communities, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AvalonBay
Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results
of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects, the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003, the
Company applied the guidance of Emerging Issues Task Force Topic D-42, “The
Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for the Redemption or Induced
Conversion of Preferred Stock.” In addition, as discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the Company adopted Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets” and as discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements, in 2001 the Company changed its method of accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)

1.

Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context
otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its
subsidiaries) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real
estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. The Company focuses on the ownership and operation of apartment
communities in high barrier-to-entry markets of the United States. These
markets are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Pacific Northwest,
and Northern and Southern California regions of the country.

At December 31, 2003, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership
interest in 131 operating apartment communities containing 38,504 apartment
homes in ten states and the District of Columbia, of which two communities
containing 1,089 apartment homes were under reconstruction. In addition, the
Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in eleven
communities under construction that are expected to contain an aggregate of
3,493 apartment homes when completed. The Company also owned a direct or
indirect ownership interest in rights to develop an additional 40 communities
that, if developed in the manner expected, will contain an estimated 10,070
apartment homes.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company is the surviving corporation from the merger (the “Merger”) of Bay
Apartment Communities, Inc. (“Bay”) and Avalon Properties, Inc. (“Avalon”) on
June 4, 1998, in which Avalon shareholders received 0.7683 of a share of common
stock of the Company for each share owned of Avalon common stock. The Merger
was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting, with the historical
financial statements for Avalon presented prior to the Merger. At that time,
Avalon ceased to legally exist, and Bay as the surviving legal entity adopted
the historical financial statements of Avalon. Consequently, Bay’s assets were
recorded in the historical financial statements of Avalon at an amount equal to
Bay’s debt outstanding at that time plus the value of capital stock retained by
the Bay stockholders, which approximates fair value. In connection with the
Merger, the Company changed its name from Bay Apartment Communities, Inc. to
AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

The Company accounts for joint venture partnerships and subsidiary partnerships
structured as DownREITs in accordance with Statement of Position (“SOP”) 78-9,
“Accounting for Investments in Real Estate Ventures.” Under SOP 78-9, the
Company consolidates joint venture and DownREIT partnerships when the Company
controls the major operating and financial policies of the partnership through
majority ownership or in its capacity as general partner. The accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned partnerships and certain joint venture partnerships in addition to
subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs. All significant intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In each of the partnerships structured as DownREITs, either the Company or one
of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner, and there
are one or more limited partners whose interest in the partnership is
represented by units of limited partnership interest. For each DownREIT
partnership, limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution
before any distribution is made to the general partner. Although the
partnership agreements for each of the DownREITs are different, generally the
distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership
interests have approximated the Company’s current common stock dividend per
share. Each DownREIT partnership has been structured so that it is unlikely
the limited partners will be entitled to a distribution greater than the
initial distribution provided for in the partnership agreement. The holders of
units of limited partnership interest have the right to present each unit of
limited partnership interest for redemption for cash equal to the fair market
value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of redemption. In
lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership of a limited partner’s unit, the
Company may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of
common stock or for such cash amount.

F-7

The Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities in accordance
with SOP 78-9 and Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 18, “The
Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” The Company uses
the equity method to account for investments in which it owns greater than 20%
of the equity value or has significant and disproportionate influence over that
entity. Investments in which the Company owns 20% or less of the equity value
and does not have significant and disproportionate influence are accounted for
using the cost method. If there is an event or change in circumstance that
indicates a loss in the value of an investment, the Company’s policy is to
record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value. A
loss in value would be indicated if the Company could not recover the carrying
value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings
capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company
did not recognize an impairment loss on any of its investments in
unconsolidated entities during the years ended December 31, 2003 or 2002.
However, during the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company recorded an
impairment loss of $934 related to a technology investment in which the Company
no longer owns an equity interest.

Revenue Recognition

Rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from
residents in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue
Recognition” and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.13,
“Accounting for Leases.” In accordance with the Company’s standard lease
terms, rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis. Any cash
concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the
approximate life of the lease, which is generally one year.

Real Estate

Significant expenditures which improve or extend the life of an asset are
capitalized. The operating real estate assets are stated at cost and consist of
land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other
costs incurred during their development, redevelopment and acquisition.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.

The Company’s policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to
capitalize only non-recurring expenditures. Improvements and upgrades are
capitalized only if the item exceeds $15, extends the useful life of the asset
and is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident.
Purchases of personal property, such as computers and furniture, are
capitalized only if the item is a new addition and exceeds $2.5. The Company
generally expenses purchases of personal property made for replacement
purposes.

The capitalization of costs during the development of assets (including
interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect
costs) begins when active development commences and ends when the asset, or a
portion of an asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, which is
generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Cost
capitalization during redevelopment of apartment homes (including interest and
related loan fees, property taxes and other direct and indirect costs) begins
when an apartment home is taken out-of-service for redevelopment and ends when
the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is
available for a new resident.

In accordance with SFAS No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Projects,” the Company capitalizes pre-development
costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which the
Company currently believes future development is probable (“Development
Rights”). Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon
various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market
conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development
costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights for which future
development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In
addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, deeming future
development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are
written-off with a charge to expense.

F-8

Depreciation is calculated on buildings and improvements using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven
to thirty years. Furniture, fixtures and equipment are generally depreciated
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range
from three years (primarily computer-related equipment) to seven years.

Lease terms for apartment homes are generally one year or less. Rental income
and operating costs incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment
lease-up period are fully recognized as they accrue.

If there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in
the value of an operating community, the Company’s policy is to assess any
impairment in value by making a comparison of the current and projected
operating cash flows of the community over its remaining useful life, on an
undiscounted basis, to the carrying amount of the community. If the carrying
amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the
community, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an
amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market
value. The Company has not recognized an impairment loss in the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001 on any of its operating communities. However,
the Company recognized an impairment loss in 2002 related to two land parcels.

Income Taxes

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 1994 and has not revoked such
election. A corporate REIT is a legal entity which holds real estate interests
and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements,
including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its
adjusted taxable income to stockholders. As a REIT, the Company generally will
not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income it
distributes currently to its stockholders. Management believes that all such
conditions for the avoidance of income taxes have been met for the periods
presented. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes has
been made. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it
will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including
any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a
REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes
on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its
undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT
activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal,
state and local income taxes.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain debt
financing and are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the
effective interest method, over the shorter of the term of the loan or the
related credit enhancement facility, if applicable. Unamortized financing
costs are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.
Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was $19,346 at December
31, 2003 and $15,496 at December 31, 2002.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Cash in Escrow

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less from the date acquired. The majority
of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrows is held at major
commercial banks.

Interest Rate Contracts

The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate
risk and has designated these financial instruments as hedges under the
guidance of SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities, an Amendment of Statement No. 133.” For fair value hedge
transactions, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and
changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the risk being hedged are
recognized in current period earnings. For cash flow hedge transactions,
changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported in other
comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges where the changes in the fair value
of the derivative exceed the change in fair value of the hedged item, the
ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings. Derivatives
which are not part of a hedge relationship are recorded at fair value through
earnings. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had approximately $165,000 in
variable rate, tax-exempt debt subject to cash flow hedges. See Note 5,
“Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income, which is defined as all changes in equity during each
period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to
shareholders, is displayed in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity. Accumulated other comprehensive loss reflects the
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges.

Earnings per Common Share

In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share,”

basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the
period. Other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to
earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted
basis. The Company’s earnings per common share are determined as follows:

Certain options to purchase shares of common stock in the amounts of 1,348,738,
1,410,397 and 18,269 were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively, but were not included in the computation of
diluted earnings per share because the options’ exercise prices were greater
than the average market price of the common shares for the period and
therefore, are anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

Prior to 2003, the Company applied the intrinsic value method as provided in
APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations, in accounting for its employee stock options. No stock-based
employee compensation cost related to employee stock options is reflected in
net income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, as all options
granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying
common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, the Company
adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure – an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123,” prospectively to all employee awards granted, modified, or
settled on or after January 1, 2003. Awards under the Company’s stock option
plans vest over periods ranging from one to three years. Therefore, the cost
related to stock-based employee compensation for employee stock options
included in the determination of net income for the year ended December 31,
2003 is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based
method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of SFAS
No. 123.

The following table illustrates the effect on net income available to common
stockholders and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been

Insured Loss

During 2000, a fire occurred at one of the Company’s development
communities, which was under construction and unoccupied at the time. The
Company had property damage and insurance for lost rental income which covered
this event. Insurance proceeds totaling $30,300 were received, of which
$22,000 was disbursed to rebuild the community for property damage. Insurance
proceeds for lost rental income of $5,800 and $2,500 are included in rental and
other income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and
Other Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Executive Separation Costs

In February 2001, the Company announced certain management changes including
the departure of a senior executive who became entitled to severance benefits
in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement with the Company. The
Company recorded a charge of approximately $2,500 in the first quarter of 2001
related to the costs associated with such departure.

In December 2001, a senior executive of the Company retired from his management
position. Upon retirement, the Company recognized compensation expense of
approximately $784, relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock
grants.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In April 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued

SFAS
No. 149, “Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” which clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative
instruments, including derivative instruments that are embedded in contracts.
This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June
30, 2003. The Company adopted this pronouncement on July 1, 2003. The
adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, “Accounting for Certain

Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.” This
statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of
financial instruments that possess characteristics similar to both liability
and equity instruments. SFAS No. 150 also addresses the classification of
certain financial instruments that include an obligation to issue equity
shares. This statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is

F-12

effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted this
pronouncement as specified above. The adoption of this statement did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of
operations.

In July 2003, the SEC clarified Emerging Issues
Task Force Topic D-42, “The Effect on the Calculation of Earnings per Share for
the Redemption or Induced Conversion of Preferred Stock.” The clarification of
Topic D-42 was effective in the first fiscal period ending after September 15,
2003 and was to be applied retroactively. As such, the Company has included in
its results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003
the initial offering costs as additional
dividends attributable to preferred stock of $280. In addition, the Company
has revised its historical results of operations for the year ended December
31, 2001 to reflect the initial offering costs as additional dividends attributable to preferred stock of
$7,538, which reduced earnings per common share-diluted by $0.10 from the
amount previously reported. No revision was required during the year ended
December 31, 2002.

In December 2003, the FASB
issued the
revised Interpretation No. (“FIN”) 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities,” which changes the guidelines for consolidation of and disclosure
related to unconsolidated entities, if those unconsolidated entities qualify as
variable interest entities, as defined in FIN 46R. The Company has adopted the
provisions of FIN 46R for variable interest entities created after January 31,
2003. However, the Company has deferred the adoption of FIN 46R for variable
interest entities created on or before January 31, 2003 until March 31, 2004.
Although the Company is still evaluating the impact of FIN 46R on entities
created on or before January 31, 2003, the Company anticipates the
consolidation of one entity from which the Company holds a participating
mortgage loan. The Company does not expect the final adoption of FIN 46R,
including the potential consolidation of this variable interest entity, to have
a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results
of operations taken as a whole.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) requires
management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Discontinued Operations

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for

the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” which requires that the assets and
liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been
sold since January 1, 2002, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented
as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements
in both current and prior periods presented. The community specific components
of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net
operating income, depreciation expense, minority interest expense and interest
expense. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment loss) on
the eventual disposal of communities held for sale will be presented as
discontinued operations when recognized. A change in presentation for
discontinued operations will not have any impact on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operations. Real estate assets held for sale are
measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to
sell, and are presented separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale, no
further depreciation is recorded on the assets.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years’ financial
statements to conform with current year presentations.

Interest Capitalized

Capitalized interest associated with communities under development or
redevelopment totaled $24,709, $29,937 and $27,635 for the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company issued $17,404 in fixed
rate, tax-exempt debt and $20,680 in fixed rate, conventional debt related to
two operating communities. In addition, the Company transferred $12,360 in
fixed rate, tax-exempt debt and $27,305 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt in
connection with the sale of two communities to the respective purchasers. In
the aggregate, mortgage notes payable mature at various dates from May 2004
through April 2043 and are collateralized by certain apartment communities. As
of December 31, 2003, the Company has guaranteed approximately $145,500 of
mortgage notes payable held by subsidiaries; all such mortgage notes payable
are consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The weighted average
interest rate of the Company’s fixed rate mortgage notes payable (conventional
and tax-exempt) was 6.7% at December 31, 2003 and 6.6% at December 31, 2002.
The weighted average interest rate of the Company’s variable rate mortgage
notes payable and its unsecured credit facility (as discussed below), including
the effect of certain financing related fees, was 3.5% at both December 31,
2003 and December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
approximately $165,000 of variable rate debt effectively fixed through Hedged
Derivatives, as described in Note 5, “Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” The Hedged Derivatives
on approximately $87,380 of this variable rate, tax-exempt debt  mature
in 2004. The Company is currently negotiating the refinancing of this
debt and, as part of the refinancing of the Company may elect to
put new Hedged Derivatives in place.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company repaid $150,000 of
previously issued unsecured notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to
their scheduled maturity, and no prepayment fees were incurred. The Company’s
unsecured notes contain a number of financial and other covenants with which
the Company must comply, including, but not limited to, limits on the aggregate
amount of total and secured indebtedness the Company may have on a consolidated
basis and limits on the Company’s required debt service payments.

The Company has a $500,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility
with J.P. Morgan Chase and Fleet National Bank serving as co-agents for a
syndicate of commercial banks, which had $51,100 outstanding and $19,901 in
letters of credit on December 31, 2003 and $28,970 outstanding and $79,999 in
letters of credit on December 31, 2002. Under the terms of the unsecured
credit facility, if the Company elects to increase the facility by up to an
additional $150,000, and one or more banks (from the syndicate or otherwise)
voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment, then the Company will
be able to increase the facility up to $650,000, and no member of the syndicate
of banks can prohibit such increase; such an increase in the facility will only
be effective to the extent banks (from the syndicate or otherwise) choose to
commit to lend additional funds. The Company pays participating banks, in the
aggregate, an annual facility fee of approximately $750 in quarterly
installments. The unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels
based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), rating levels achieved on
the Company’s unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by the
Company. The current stated pricing is LIBOR plus 0.60% per annum (1.72% on
December 31, 2003). Pricing could vary if there is a change in rating by
either of the two leading national rating agencies; a change in rating of one
level would impact the unsecured credit facility pricing by 0.05% to 0.15%. In
addition, the unsecured credit facility includes a competitive bid option,
which allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to make loans
to the Company at a rate that is lower than the stated rate provided by the
unsecured credit facility for up to $400,000. The competitive bid option may
result in lower pricing if market conditions allow. The Company had no
outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at December 31, 2003.
The Company is subject to (i) certain customary covenants under the unsecured
credit facility, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain maximum
leverage ratios, a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum
unencumbered assets and equity levels and (ii) prohibitions on paying dividends
in amounts that exceed 95% of the Company’s Funds from Operations, as defined
therein, except as may be required to maintain the Company’s REIT status. The
existing facility matures in May 2004, unless the Company exercises a one-year
renewal option. The Company expects to renegotiate the facility prior to
maturity without exercising the renewal option, however there can be no
assurance that the renegotiation will occur.

Stockholders’ Equity

As of both December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had authorized for issuance
140,000,000 and 50,000,000 shares of common and preferred stock, respectively.
Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative from the date of original issue
and are payable quarterly in arrears on or before the 15th day of each month as
stated in the table below. The preferred stock is not redeemable prior to the
date stated in the table below, but on or after the stated date, may be
redeemed for cash at the option of the Company in whole or in part at a
redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends, if
any.

In March 2003, the Company redeemed all 3,267,700 outstanding shares of its
8.00% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per
share, plus $0.0167 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate
redemption price of $81,747, including accrued dividends of $54. The
redemption price was funded by the sale of 3,336,611 shares of Series J
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock through a private placement to an
institutional investor for a net purchase price of $81,737. The dividend rate
on such shares was initially equal to 2.78% per annum (three-month LIBOR plus
1.5%) of the liquidation preference. As permitted under the terms of such
preferred stock, the Company redeemed all of the Series J Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock in May 2003, for an aggregate redemption price of $82,207,
including dividends of $251.

As of December 31, 2003 the
Company has the following series of redeemable preferred stock outstanding at a stated value of $100,000. This series has no stated maturity and is not
subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemptions.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company completed a common stock
offering totaling 2,804,700 shares at a public offering price of $46.00 per
share. The net proceeds from this offering, after underwriting discounts and
commissions, of approximately $127,333 were used to repay a portion of amounts
outstanding on the unsecured credit facility and for general corporate
purposes.

In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company (i) issued
620,107 shares of common stock in connection with stock options exercised, (ii)
issued 328,731 shares of common stock in exchange for the redemption of an
equal number of DownREIT limited partnership units, (iii) issued 14,393 shares of common
stock to employees under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (iv) issued 114,895
common shares in connection with stock grants to employees of which 80% are
restricted, (v) had forfeitures of 12,102 shares of restricted stock grants to
employees and (vi) withheld 37,124 shares to satisfy employees’ tax withholding
and other liabilities.

In 2002 the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase
program, under which the Company may acquire shares of its common stock in open
market or negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program was designed
so that retained cash flow, as well as the proceeds from sales of existing
apartment communities and a reduction in planned acquisitions, will provide the
source of funding for the program, with the Company’s unsecured credit facility
providing temporary funding as needed. As of December 31, 2003, the Company
had repurchased a total of 2,380,600 shares of common stock at an aggregate
cost of $89,566 through this program. The Company has not repurchased any
shares of common stock since March 31, 2003.

Dividends per common share for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001
were $2.80, $2.80 and $2.56 per share, respectively. In 2003, average
dividends for preferred shares redeemed during the year were $0.27 per share
and average dividends for all non-redeemed preferred shares were $2.18 per
share. In 2002, average dividends for preferred shares redeemed during the
period were $0.92 per share and average dividends for all non-
redeemed preferred shares were $2.10 per share. In 2001, average dividends for
preferred shares redeemed during the year were $1.41 per share and average dividends
for all non-redeemed preferred shares were $2.10 per share.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company has historically used interest rate swap and cap agreements
(collectively, the “Hedged Derivatives”) to reduce the impact of interest rate
fluctuations on its variable rate, tax-exempt bonds. The Company has not
entered into any interest rate hedge agreements or treasury locks for its
conventional unsecured debt and does not hold interest rate hedge agreements
for trading or other speculative purposes. As of December 31, 2003, the Hedged
Derivatives fix approximately $157,500 of the Company’s tax-exempt debt at a
weighted average interest rate of 6.1% and cap approximately $7,000 at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%. These Hedged Derivatives have maturity dates ranging from
2004 to 2010. In addition, one of the Company’s unconsolidated real estate
investments (see Note 6, “Investments in Unconsolidated Entities”) has $22,500 in variable rate debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2003, which is subject to an interest rate swap.
This debt is not recourse to or guaranteed by the Company. The Hedged
Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, which as
amended, was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires
that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an
asset or liability measured at its fair value, with changes in fair value
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met.

The Company has determined that its Hedged Derivatives qualify as effective
cash-flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, resulting in the Company recording all
changes in the fair value of the Hedged Derivatives in other comprehensive
income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified
into earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash
flows. At January 1, 2001, in accordance with the transition provisions of
SFAS No. 133, the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $6,412 to
other comprehensive loss to recognize at fair value all of the derivatives that
are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. To adjust the Hedged
Derivatives to their fair value, the Company recorded an unrealized gain to
other comprehensive income of $4,428 in the year ended December 31, 2003 and
unrealized losses of $4,157 and $2,599 in the years ended December 31, 2002 and
2001, respectively. In addition, a Hedged Derivative
 with a fair value of $528
was transferred in connection with the sale of a community during the first
quarter of 2001. The estimated amount, included in accumulated other
comprehensive income as of December 31, 2003, expected to be reclassified
into earnings within the next twelve months to offset the variability of cash
flows during this period is not material.

The Company assesses, both at inception and on an on-going basis, the
effectiveness of all hedges in offsetting cash flows of hedged items. Hedge
ineffectiveness did not have a material impact on earnings and the Company does
not anticipate that it will have a material effect in the future. The fair
values of the obligations under the Hedged Derivatives are included in accrued
expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in
interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. The
credit risk is the risk of a counterparty not performing under the terms of the
Hedged Derivatives. The counterparties to these Hedged Derivatives are major
financial institutions which have an A+ or better credit rating by the Standard
& Poor’s Ratings Group. The Company monitors the credit ratings of
counterparties and the amount of the Company’s debt subject to Hedged
Derivatives with any one party. Therefore, the Company believes the likelihood
of realizing material losses from counterparty non-performance is remote.
Market risk is the adverse effect of the value of financial instruments that
results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with
interest-rate contracts is managed by the establishment and monitoring of
parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be
undertaken. These risks are managed by the Company’s Chief Financial Officer
and Senior Vice President – Finance.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate Entities

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had investments in the following
unconsolidated real estate entities, which are accounted for under the equity
method of accounting, except as described below:

•

Town Run Associates

was formed as a general partnership in
November 1994 to develop, own and operate Avalon Run, a 426
apartment-home community located in Lawrenceville, New Jersey.
Since formation of this venture, the Company has invested $1,803
and, following a preferred return on all contributed equity (which
was achieved in 2003), has a 40% ownership and cash flow interest
with a 49% residual economic interest. The Company is responsible
for the day-to-day operations of the Avalon Run community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement.
The development of Avalon Run was funded entirely through equity
contributions from Avalon as well as the other venture partner, and
therefore Avalon Run is not subject to any outstanding debt as of
December 31, 2003.

•

Town Grove, LLC

was formed as a limited liability corporation
in December 1997 to develop, own and operate Avalon Grove, a 402
apartment-home community located in Stamford, Connecticut. Since
formation of this venture, the Company has invested $14,653 and,
following a preferred return on all contributed equity (which was
achieved in 2003), has a 50% ownership and a 50% cash flow and
residual economic interest. The Company is responsible for the
day-to-day operations of the Avalon Grove community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement.
The development of Avalon Grove was funded through contributions
from the Company and the other venture partner, and therefore Avalon
Grove is not subject to any outstanding debt as of December 31,
2003.

•

Avalon Terrace, LLC

– The Company acquired Avalon Bedford, a
388 apartment-home community located in Stamford, Connecticut in
December 1998. In May 2000, the Company transferred Avalon Bedford
to Avalon Terrace, LLC and subsequently admitted a joint venture
partner, while retaining a 25% ownership interest in this limited
liability company for an investment of $5,394 and a right to 50% of
cash flow distributions after achievement of a threshold return
(which was not achieved in 2003). The Company is responsible for
the day-to-day operations of the Avalon Bedford community and is the
management agent subject to the terms of a management agreement. As
of December 31, 2003, Avalon Bedford has $22,500 in variable rate
debt outstanding, which came due in November 2002, but was extended
until November 2005. The interest rate on this debt is fixed
through a Hedged Derivative as discussed in Note 5, “Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities.”

•

Arna Valley View Limited Partnership

– In connection with
the municipal approval process for the development of two
consolidated communities, the Company agreed to participate in the
formation of a limited partnership in February 1999 to develop,
finance, own and operate Arna Valley View, a 101 apartment-home
community located in Arlington, Virginia. This community has
affordable rents for 100% of apartment homes related to the
tax-exempt bond financing and tax credits used to finance
construction of the community. A subsidiary of the Company is the
general partner of the partnership with a 0.01% ownership interest.
The Company is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the
community and is the management agent subject to the terms of a
management agreement. As of December 31, 2003, Arna Valley View has
$6,026 of variable rate, tax-exempt bonds outstanding, which mature
in June 2032. In addition, Arna Valley View has $4,583 of 4% fixed
rate county bonds outstanding that mature in December 2030. Due to
the Company’s limited ownership and investment in this venture, it
is accounted for using the cost method.

In September 2003, Falkland Chase, a 450 apartment home community located in
Silver Spring, MD, was sold by Falkland Partners, LLC, in which the Company has
held a 50% membership interest since 1993. The Company’s share of the $58,500
sales price for this community was $29,250, resulting in net proceeds to the
Company of

F-18

$16,729. The Company’s share of the GAAP gain reported by Falkland Partners,
LLC is $21,816 and is included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities
on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive
Income. The Company recognized an additional gain in accordance with GAAP of
$1,632 in conjunction with the liquidation of the limited liability company’s
assets, which is also included in equity in income of unconsolidated entities
on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive
Income. The combined summaries of financial position and operating results
presented below have been revised to exclude the financial information of the
Falkland Chase community.

The Company also holds a 25% limited liability company membership interest in
the limited liability company that owns Avalon on the Sound. The Company,
which originally owned 100% of the limited liability company, sold a 75%
controlling interest in the limited liability company to a third-party in 2000.
As part of the sale, the Company retained an option to repurchase the 75%
interest. The Company believes it is unlikely that the repurchase option will
be exercised. This repurchase option will terminate in 2005. In accordance
with SFAS No. 66, “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate,” the sale of the 75%
interest is not recognized due to the existence of the repurchase
option, and therefore the Company accounts for Avalon on the Sound as a
profit-sharing arrangement. As a result, the revenues and expenses, and assets
and liabilities of Avalon on the Sound are included in the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements, with the 75% interest presented as part of
accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets. A reclassification has been made in prior years to move the 75%
interest from minority interest to accrued expenses and other liabilities on
the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to conform with current year
presentation. The income allocated to the controlling partner is shown as
venture partner interest in profit-sharing on the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations and Other Comprehensive Income. These
reclassifications did not have any impact on total assets, net income or any
other supplemental measure of operating performance.

Investments in Unconsolidated Non-Real Estate Entities

At December 31, 2003, the Company held minority interest investments in three
non-real estate entities, all of which are technology companies. Based on
ownership and control criteria, the Company accounts for one of these
investments using the equity method, with the remaining non-real estate
investments accounted for at cost. During the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, the Company recorded losses of $115, $3,166 and $1,730,
respectively, related to Realeum, Inc., the investment accounted for under the equity method,
bringing the carrying value of the investment to zero as of both December 31,
2003 and 2002. The aggregate carrying value of the Company’s investment in
unconsolidated non-real estate entities was $1,456 and $1,855 as of December
31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.

In addition, as of December 31, 2003, the Company had one community that
qualified as held for sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 144. As required
under SFAS No. 144, the operations for any communities sold from January 1,
2002 through December 31, 2003 and communities held for sale as of December 31,
2003 have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets include other assets (excluding net

other liabilities of $546 and $5,913 as of December 31, 2003 and  2002, respectively, relating to real estate assets sold or held for sale. The
estimated proceeds less anticipated costs to sell the real estate assets held
for sale as of December 31, 2003 are greater than the carrying values as of
December 31, 2003, and therefore no provisions for possible losses were
recorded.

The Company sold a land parcel in 2003, which was originally owned by the
Company in connection with a development right in Oakland, California, for
which net proceeds of approximately $6,600 were received upon sale.

Commitments and Contingencies

Employment Agreements and Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, the Company had employment agreements with five
executive officers. The employment agreements provide for severance payments
and generally provide for accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted
stock in the event of a termination of employment (except for a termination by
the Company with cause or a voluntary termination by the employee). The
current term of these agreements ends on dates that vary between December 2004
and November 2006. The employment agreements provide for one-year automatic
renewals (two years in the case of the Chief Executive Officer
(“CEO”)) after the initial term unless an
advance notice of non-renewal is provided by either party. Upon a notice of
non-renewal by the Company, each of the officers may terminate his employment
and receive a severance payment. Upon a change in control, the agreements
provide for an automatic extension of up to three years from the date of the
change in control. The employment agreements provide for base salary and
incentive compensation in the form of cash awards, stock options and stock
grants subject to the discretion of, and attainment of performance goals
established by, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company adopted an Officer Severance
Program (the “Program”) for the benefit of those officers of the Company who do
not have employment agreements. Under the Program, in the event an officer who
is not otherwise covered by a severance arrangement is terminated (other than
for cause) within two years of a change in control (as defined) of the Company,
such officer will generally receive a cash lump sum payment equal to the sum of
such officer’s base salary and cash bonus, as well as accelerated vesting of
stock options and restricted stock.

F-21

Legal Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in
the ordinary course of business. These matters are frequently covered by
insurance. If it has been determined that a loss is probable to occur, the
estimated amount of the loss is expensed in the financial statements. While
the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management
believes the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.

Lease Obligations

The Company owns six apartment communities which are located on land subject to
land leases expiring between July 2029 and March 2142. In addition, the
Company leases certain office space. These leases are accounted for as
operating leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases.”

The following table details the future minimum lease payments under the
Company’s current operating leases:

Segment Reporting

The Company’s reportable operating segments include Established Communities,
Other Stabilized Communities, and Development/Redevelopment Communities.
Annually as of January 1st, the Company determines which of its communities
fall into each of these categories and maintains that classification throughout
the year for the purpose of reporting segment operations.

•

Established Communities

(also known as Same
Store Communities) are communities where a comparison
of operating results from the prior year to the current
year is meaningful, as these communities were owned and
had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of
the beginning of the prior year. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Established Communities are
communities that had stabilized occupancy and operating
expenses as of January 1, 2002, are not conducting or
planning to conduct substantial redevelopment
activities and are not held for sale or planned for
disposition within the current year. A community is
considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier
of (i) attainment of 95% physical occupancy or (ii) the
one-year anniversary of completion of development or
redevelopment.

•

Other Stabilized Communities

includes all
other completed communities that have stabilized
occupancy, as defined above. Other Stabilized
Communities do not include communities that are
conducting or planning to conduct substantial
redevelopment activities within the current year.

•

Development/Redevelopment Communities

consists of communities that are under construction and
have not received a final certificate of occupancy,
communities where substantial redevelopment is in
progress or is planned to begin during the current year
and communities under lease-up, that had not reached
stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January
1, 2003.

In addition, the Company owns land held for future development and has other
corporate assets that are not allocated to an operating segment.

F-22

SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information,” requires that segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by
the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing such segments’
performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is comprised of
several members of its executive management team who use Net Operating Income
(“NOI”) as the primary financial measure for Established and Other Stabilized
Communities. NOI is defined by the Company as total revenue less direct
property operating expenses, including property taxes, and excludes
corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses,
interest income and expense, general and administrative expense, equity in
income of unconsolidated entities, minority interest in consolidated
partnerships, venture partner interest in profit-sharing, depreciation expense,
impairment loss, gain on sale of communities and income from discontinued
operations. Although the Company considers NOI a useful measure of a
community’s or communities’ operating performance, NOI should not be considered
an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities, as
determined in accordance with GAAP.

The primary performance measure for communities under development or
redevelopment depends on the stage of completion. While under development,
management monitors actual construction costs against budgeted costs as well as
lease-up pace and rent levels compared to budget.

The following table provides details of the Company’s segment information as of
the dates specified. The segments are classified based on the individual
community’s status as of the beginning of the given calendar year. Therefore,
each year the composition of communities within each business segment is
adjusted. Accordingly, the amounts between years are not directly comparable.
The accounting policies applicable to the operating segments described above
are the same as those described in Note 1, “Organization and Significant
Accounting Policies.”

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company has a stock incentive plan (the “1994 Plan”), which was amended

and
restated on March 31, 2001. Individuals who are eligible to participate in the
1994 Plan include officers, other associates, outside directors and other key
persons of the Company and its subsidiaries who are responsible for or
contribute to the management, growth or profitability of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The 1994 Plan authorizes (i) the grant of stock options that
qualify as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code (“ISOs”), (ii) the grant of stock options that do not so qualify, (iii)
grants of shares of restricted and unrestricted common stock, (iv) grants of
deferred stock awards, (v) performance share awards entitling the recipient to
acquire shares of common stock and (vi) dividend equivalent rights.

Shares of common stock of 2,358,393, 2,084,207 and 2,126,335 were
available for future option or restricted stock grant awards under
the 1994 Plan as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
On each January 1, the maximum
number available for issuance under the 1994 Plan is increased by between 0.48%
and 1.00% of the total number of shares of common stock and DownREIT units
actually outstanding on such date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum
number of shares of stock for which ISOs may be issued under the 1994 Plan
shall not exceed 2,500,000 and no awards shall be granted under the 1994 Plan
after May 11, 2011. Options and restricted stock granted under the 1994 Plan
vest and expire over varying periods, as determined by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors.

Before the Merger, Avalon had adopted its 1995 Equity Incentive Plan (the
“Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan”). Under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan, a maximum
number of 3,315,054 shares (or 2,546,956 shares as adjusted for the Merger) of
common stock were issuable, plus any shares of common stock represented by
awards under Avalon’s 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the “Avalon 1993
Plan”) that were forfeited, canceled, reacquired by Avalon, satisfied without
the issuance of common stock or otherwise terminated (other than by exercise).
Options granted to officers, non-employee directors and associates under the
Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan generally vested over a three-year term, expire ten
years from the date of grant and are exercisable at the market price on the
date of grant.

In connection with the Merger, the exercise prices and the number of options
under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan and the Avalon 1993 Plan were adjusted to
reflect the equivalent Bay shares and exercise prices based on the 0.7683 share
conversion ratio used in the Merger. Officers, non-employee directors and
associates with Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan or Avalon 1993 Plan options may
exercise their adjusted number of options for the Company’s common stock at the
adjusted exercise price. As of June 4, 1998, the date of the Merger, options
and other awards ceased to be granted under the Avalon 1993 Plan or the Avalon
1995 Incentive Plan. Accordingly, there were no options to purchase shares of
common stock available for grant under the Avalon 1995 Incentive Plan or the
Avalon 1993 Plan at December 31, 2003, 2002 or 2001.

For options outstanding at December 31, 2003 under the 1994 Plan, 84,600
options had exercise prices ranging between $18.37 and $29.99 and a weighted
average contractual life of 1.8 years, 1,481,427 options had exercise prices
ranging between $30.00 and $39.99 and a weighted average contractual life of
6.0 years, and 1,413,238 options had exercise prices ranging between $40.00 and
$49.90 and a weighted average contractual life of 7.6 years. Options
outstanding at December 31, 2003 for the Avalon 1993 and Avalon 1995 Plans had
exercise prices ranging from $27.33 to $39.70 and a weighted average
contractual life of 3.8 years.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123 prospectively to all employee awards granted,
modified, or settled on or after January 1, 2003. The effect on net income
available to common stockholders and earnings per share if the fair value based
method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each year
based on the fair market value as determined on the date of grant is reflected
in Note 1, “Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.”

The weighted average fair value of the
  options granted during 2003 is estimated at $1.94 per share on the date of grant
  using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
  assumptions: dividend yield of 7.56%, volatility of 18.68%, risk-free interest
  rates of 3.31% and an expected life of approximately
  7 years. The weighted average fair value of the options granted during
  2002 is estimated at $4.52 per share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
  option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend
  yield of 6.15%, volatility of 18.90%, risk-free interest rates of 4.81%
  and an expected life of approximately 7 years. The
  weighted average fair value of the options granted during 2001 is estimated
  at $4.83 per share on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing
  model with the following weighted average assumptions: dividend yield of 5.58%,
  volatility of 16.47%, risk-free interest rates of 5.07%
  and an expected life of approximately 7 years.
The cost related to stock-based employee compensation for employee stock options
included in the determination of net income is based on actual forfeitures for the given year.

F-26

In October 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (as amended, the “ESPP”). Initially 1,000,000 shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. There are currently 687,949
shares remaining available for issuance under the plan. Full-time employees of
the Company generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if, as of the
last day of the applicable election period, they have been employed by the
Company for at least one month. All other employees of the Company are
eligible to participate provided that as of the applicable election period they
have been employed by the Company for twelve months. Under the ESPP, eligible
employees are permitted to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions, subject to maximum purchase limitations. The purchase
period is a period of seven months beginning each May 1 and ending each
November 30. The purchase price for common stock purchased under the plan is
85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the
first day of the applicable purchase period or the last day of the applicable
purchase period. The offering dates, purchase dates and duration of purchase
periods may be changed by the Board of Directors, if the change is announced
prior to the beginning of the affected date or purchase period. The Company
issued 14,393 shares, 29,345 shares and 14,917 shares under the ESPP for 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

11.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Cash and cash equivalent balances are held with various financial institutions
and may at times exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
limit. The Company monitors credit ratings of these financial institutions and
the concentration of cash and cash equivalent balances with any one financial
institution and believes the likelihood of realizing material losses from the
excess of cash and cash equivalent balances over insurance limits is remote.

The following estimated fair values of financial instruments were determined by
management using available market information and established valuation
methodologies, including discounted cash flows. Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could
realize on disposition of the financial instruments. The use of different
market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect
on the estimated fair value amounts.

•

Cash equivalents, rents receivable, accounts payable and
accrued expenses, and other liabilities are carried at their
face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values.

•

Bond indebtedness and notes payable with an aggregate
carrying value of approximately $2,286,000 and $2,442,000 had
an estimated aggregate fair value of $2,556,000 and
$2,639,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

12.

Related Party Arrangements

Purchase of Mortgage Loan

The Company’s Chairman and CEO is a partner of an entity that is the general
partner of Arbor Commons Associates Limited Partnership (“Arbor Commons
Associates”). Arbor Commons Associates owns Avalon Arbor, a 302 apartment home
community in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. Concurrently with its initial public
offering in November 1993, Avalon Properties, Inc. (“Avalon”), a predecessor
entity, purchased an existing participating mortgage loan made to Arbor Commons
Associates that was originated by CIGNA Investments, Inc. The mortgage loan is
secured by Arbor Commons Associates’ interest in Avalon Arbor. This loan
accrues interest at a fixed rate of 10.2% per annum, payable at 9.0% per annum.
The balance of the note receivable at both December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002 was $21,483. The balance of accrued interest on the note receivable as of
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively, was $5,834 and $4,965,
and is included in other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance
Sheets. Related interest income of $3,168, $3,091 and $3,081 was recorded for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Under the
terms of the loan, the Company (as successor to Avalon) receives (as contingent
interest) 50% of the cash flow after the 10.2% accrual rate is paid and 50% of
the residual profits upon the sale of the community.

F-27

Unconsolidated entities

The Company manages several unconsolidated real estate joint venture entities
for which it receives management fee revenue. From these entities the Company
received management fee revenue of $851, $1,019 and $1,011 in the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.

Indebtedness of Management

The Company had a recourse loan program under which the Company lent amounts to
or on behalf of employees (“Stock Loans”) equivalent to the estimated
employees’ tax withholding liabilities related to the vesting of restricted
stock under the 1994 Plan. In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, no loans to senior
officers were renewed after January 1, 2003 and all were repaid in full by
March 31, 2003. The Company has phased out the Stock Loan program for all
other participants, with all loans to be repaid by March 1, 2004. The
principal balance outstanding under the Stock Loans was $104 and $1,133 as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Each Stock Loan was made for a
one-year term, is a full personal recourse obligation of the borrower and is
secured by a pledge to the Company of the stock that vested and gave rise to
the tax withholding liability for which the loan was made. In addition,
dividends on the pledged stock are automatically remitted to the Company and
applied toward repayment of the Stock Loan.

Consulting Agreement with Mr. Meyer

In March 2000, the Company and Gilbert M. Meyer announced that Mr. Meyer

would
retire as Executive Chairman of the Company in May 2000. Although Mr. Meyer
ceased his day-to-day involvement with the Company as an executive officer, he
continues to serve as a director. In addition, pursuant to a consulting
agreement which terminated in May 2003, Mr. Meyer agreed to serve as a
consultant to the Company for three years following his retirement for an
annual fee of $1,395. In such capacity he responded to requests for assistance
or information concerning business matters with which he became familiar while
employed and he provided business advice and counsel to the Company with
respect to business strategies and acquisitions, dispositions, development and
redevelopment of multifamily rental properties.

Director Compensation

The Company’s 1994 Plan provides that directors of the Company who
are also employees receive no additional compensation for their services as a
director. In accordance with the Company’s 1994 Plan, as then in
effect, on the fifth business day following each of the Company’s May 2003 and
May 2002 Annual Meetings of Stockholders, each of the Company’s non-employee
directors automatically received options to purchase 7,000 shares of common
stock at the last reported sale price of the common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) on such
date, and a restricted stock grant (or, in lieu thereof, a deferred stock
award) of 2,500 shares of common stock. The Company recorded compensation
expense relating to the restricted stock grants, deferred stock awards and
stock options in the amount of $824, $743 and $624 in the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Deferred compensation relating to these
restricted stock grants, deferred stock awards and stock options was $722 and $757 on December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. On May 14, 2003, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved an amendment to the 1994 Plan pursuant to which,
in lieu of the stock and option awards described above, each non-employee
director would receive, following the 2004 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and
each annual meeting thereafter, (i) a number of shares of restricted stock (or
deferred stock awards) having a value of $100 based on the last reported sale
price of the common stock on the NYSE on the fifth business day following the
prior year’s annual meeting and (ii) $30 cash, payable in quarterly
installments of $7.5. A non-employee director may elect to receive
all or a portion of such cash payment in the form of a deferred stock
award.

Investment in Realeum, Inc.

As an employee incentive and retention mechanism, the Company arranged for
officers of the Company to hold direct or indirect economic interests in
Realeum, Inc. Realeum, Inc. is a company involved in the development and
deployment of a property management and leasing automation system in which the
Company invested $2,300 in January 2002. The Company currently utilizes this
property management and leasing automation system and has

F-28

paid $471, $480 and $80 to Realeum, Inc. under the terms of its licensing
arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Subsequent Events

In January 2004, Arbor Commons Associates was unable to make its mortgage note
payment, resulting in a default on the note receivable held by the Company as
discussed in Note 12, “Related Party Arrangements.” In February 2004, Arbor
Commons Associates remedied this default by paying the outstanding payment.
The Company believes that the carrying amount of its note receivable from Arbor
Commons Associates is fully recoverable.

In February 2004, the Company repaid $125,000 of previously issued unsecured
notes, along with any unpaid interest, pursuant to their scheduled maturity.
Also in February 2004, the Company repaid $11,381 in fixed rate mortgage debt
secured by a current community, along with any unpaid interest, prior to its
scheduled maturity of August 2004. No prepayment penalties were incurred.

In February 2004, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with an
unrelated third-party for the development of Avalon Chrystie Place I, located
in New York, NY. Avalon Chrystie Place I, when completed, is expected to
contain 361 apartment homes for a total capital cost of approximately $149,900.
The construction of this community will be partially funded through the
issuance of $117,000 in variable rate, tax-exempt debt, $58,500 of which closed
in February 2004, with the remainder expected to close in the fourth quarter of
2004. The Company holds a 20% equity interest in this joint venture entity.

Also in February 2004, the Company had credit enhancements, including
Hedged Derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps, on approximately $87,380
of its variable rate, tax-exempt debt that expired according to the original
terms and that have not been extended. However, the Company has replaced the
credit enhancements on this debt, including Hedged Derivatives in the form of
interest rate caps ranging from 6.7% to 9.0%. The underlying debt has a
weighted average variable interest rate (exclusive of credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees’ fees, etc.) of 0.9% as of February 27, 2004, which
has been capped at a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% through Hedged
Derivatives. The credit enhancements, including the Hedged Derivatives, mature
in 2014.

As of February 27, 2004, one community previously held for operating purposes
was classified as held for sale under SFAS No. 144. This community has a net real
estate carrying value of $29,973 and debt of $18,755 as of December 31, 2003.
The Company is actively pursuing the disposition of the community and expects
to close during the second quarter of 2004.
