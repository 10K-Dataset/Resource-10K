PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care
services companies in the United States. At December 31,
2002, the Company operated 179 hospitals, comprised of 166
general, acute care hospitals, six psychiatric hospitals, one
rehabilitation hospital and six hospitals included in joint
ventures, which are accounted for using the equity method. In
addition, the Company operated 78 freestanding surgery centers,
four of which are accounted for using the equity method. The
Company’s facilities are located in 22 states, England and
Switzerland. The terms “Company” and “HCA”
as used herein refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless
otherwise stated or indicated by context. The term
“affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of
HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
subsidiaries are partners.

HCA’s primary objective is to provide the
communities it serves a comprehensive array of quality health
care services in the most cost-effective manner possible.
HCA’s general, acute care hospitals provide a full range of
services to accommodate such medical specialties as internal
medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery,
orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic and emergency
services. Outpatient and ancillary health care services are
provided by HCA’s general, acute care hospitals and through
HCA’s freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers, and
rehabilitation facilities. HCA’s psychiatric hospitals
provide a full range of mental health care services through
inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January
1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993.
HCA’s principal executive offices are located at One Park
Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and its telephone number is
(615) 344-9551.

Business Strategy

HCA’s business strategy is to be a
comprehensive provider of quality health care services in the
most cost-effective manner and consistent with its ethics and
compliance program, applicable governmental regulations and
guidelines and industry standards. HCA also seeks to enhance
financial performance by increasing utilization of its
facilities and improving operating efficiencies. To achieve
these objectives, HCA pursues the following strategies:

•

emphasize a “patients first” philosophy;

•

commitment to ethics and compliance;

•

focus on strong assets and invest capital in
    select, core communities;



HCA, and the health care industry in general, are
facing many challenges, including the growing number of
uninsured patients, the availability and rising cost of labor,
rising employee health benefit costs, and the increasing costs
of supplies, pharmaceuticals and new technologies. As a response
to some of these challenges, HCA is implementing shared services
and other initiatives. These important initiatives include a
company-wide shared services program designed to reduce
operating costs and provide additional resources for patient
care by consolidating hospitals’ back-office functions such
as billing and collections and information systems initiatives
to standardize and upgrade financial, human resources and
patient accounting systems. In addition, HCA is implementing
company-wide supply improvement and distribution programs that
include consolidating purchasing functions regionally, combining
warehouses and developing division-based procurement programs.
The Company has also undertaken both company-wide and
market-based initiatives to enhance recruitment and retention
efforts and has implemented various leadership and career
development programs.

Health Care Facilities

HCA currently owns, manages or operates
hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers,
radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive
rehabilitation and physical therapy centers and various other
facilities.

At December 31, 2002, HCA operated 166
general, acute care hospitals with 39,260 licensed beds and an
additional five hospitals with 1,925 licensed beds that are
operated through joint ventures, which are accounted for using
the equity method. Most of HCA’s general, acute care
hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including
inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic
services and emergency services. The general, acute care
hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient
surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology
and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical
staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up
of members of the local community.

Like most hospitals, HCA’s hospitals do not
engage in extensive medical research and education programs.
However, some of HCA’s hospitals are affiliated with
medical schools and may participate in the clinical rotation of
medical interns and residents and other education programs.

At December 31, 2002, HCA operated six
psychiatric hospitals with 608 licensed beds. HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including
child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and
adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

Outpatient health care facilities operated by HCA
include freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers,
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
integral component of HCA’s strategy to develop
comprehensive health care networks in select communities.

In addition to providing capital resources, HCA
makes available a variety of management services to its health
care facilities, including ethics and compliance programs;
national supply contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing
contracts; accounting, financial and clinical systems;
governmental reimbursement assistance; construction planning and
coordination; information technology systems and solutions;
legal counsel; personnel management; and internal audit.



Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy
levels and the medical and ancillary services ordered by
physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient
procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services.
Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary
significantly depending on the type of service (e.g.,
medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the
geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels
fluctuate from time-to-time for various reasons, many of which
are beyond the Company’s control.

HCA receives payment for patient services from
the Federal government primarily under the Medicare program,
state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar
programs, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”),
preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and private
insurers, as well as directly from patients. The approximate
percentages of patient revenues of the Company’s facilities
from such sources were as follows:

Medicare is a Federal program that provides
certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age
65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with end-stage
renal disease. Medicaid is a Federal-state program, administered
by the states, which provides hospital and medical benefits to
qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care.
Substantially all of HCA’s hospitals are certified as
health care services providers for persons covered under the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare
and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than the
hospital’s established gross charges for the services
provided.

HCA’s hospitals generally offer discounts
from established charges to certain large group purchasers of
health care services, including Blue Cross, other private
insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other managed
care plans. Blue Cross is a private health care program that
funds hospital benefits through independent plans that vary in
each state. These discount programs limit HCA’s ability to
increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See
Item 1: Business — Competition. Patients are
generally not responsible for any difference between established
hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services
under Medicare, Medicaid, some Blue Cross plans, HMOs or PPOs,
but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles
or co-insurance features of their coverage. The amount of such
exclusions, deductibles and co-insurance has been increasing
each year. Collection of amounts due from individuals is
typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party
payers. In March 2003, HCA announced plans to change its charity
care policies, subject to approval by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), to provide financial
relief to more of its charity patients and needs based discounts
to uninsured patients who receive non-elective care at its
hospitals. The planned changes are expected to adversely affect
hospital revenues. See “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations — Revenue/Volume Trends.”

Medicare

Under the Medicare program, HCA receives
reimbursement under a prospective payment system
(“PPS”) for inpatient and outpatient hospital
services. Under hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts
per inpatient discharge are established based on the
patient’s assigned diagnosis related group
(“DRG”). DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources
necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. DRG
weights are based upon a statistically normal distribution of
severity. When the cost of treatment for certain patients falls
well outside the normal distribution, providers typically
receive additional “outlier” payments. DRG payments do
not consider a specific hospital’s cost, but



are adjusted for area wage differentials. For
cost reporting periods beginning after September 30, 2001,
all hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” are
reimbursed for inpatient capital costs on a PPS based on DRG
weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted Federal rate,
unless a hospital qualifies for a special exceptions payment.

DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are
recalibrated each Federal fiscal year. The index used to adjust
the DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives
consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and
entities outside of the health care industry in purchasing goods
and services. However, for several years the percentage
increases to the DRG rates have been lower than the percentage
increases in the costs of goods and services purchased by
hospitals. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefit Improvement
and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”) was enacted in
December 2000. Under BIPA, in Federal fiscal year 2002, the DRG
rate increase was market basket of 3.3% minus 0.55% (or 2.75%).
In Federal fiscal year 2003, the DRG rate increase is market
basket of 3.5% minus 0.55% (or 2.95%). BIPA provides for DRG
rate updates in Federal fiscal year 2004 of full market basket.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside
5.1% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases.
During Federal fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the CMS payments for
cost outlier cases exceeded the 5.1% set aside. Outlier payments
are made by CMS for those DRG cases where the cost of the case
exceeds the total DRG payments plus a fixed threshold amount.
CMS has increased the outlier cost threshold for Federal fiscal
years 2002 and 2003, which will reduce the number of cases that
qualify for outlier payments and the amount of payments for
qualifying outlier cases. CMS increased the threshold from
$17,550 in Federal fiscal year 2001 to $21,025 for 2002 and
$33,560 for 2003.

Presently, in order to calculate whether outlier
payments are due, the Medicare fiscal intermediary multiplies
the hospital’s billed (or gross) charges on its Medicare
claim by its cost-to-charge ratio from the most recently final
settled Medicare cost report. The product of that calculation is
considered the cost of the claim. An outlier payment is made for
80% of such costs in excess of the total DRG payment for that
claim plus the fixed threshold amount ($33,560 for Federal
fiscal year 2003). However, when the hospital specific
cost-to-charge ratio from the most recently final settled
Medicare cost report varies by more than three standard
deviations from the range considered reasonable under CMS
regulations, the hospital’s estimated costs for the
Medicare claim are determined by utilizing the statewide average
cost-to-charge ratio.

In December 2002, CMS issued Program Memoranda to
the Medicare fiscal intermediaries, in which CMS expressed
concern about unusually high charge increases and out-of-date
cost-to-charge ratios. As a result of these concerns, CMS
instructed Medicare fiscal intermediaries to perform audits and
medical reviews of hospitals that have outlier payments or
charge increases above specified criteria.

On March 5, 2003, CMS published a proposed
rule that would modify the methodology for determining Medicare
outlier payments in order to ensure that only the highest cost
cases are entitled to receive payments from CMS’ 5.1%
set-aside pool. The proposed rule would allow fiscal
intermediaries to calculate outlier payments using a
provider’s most recent tentative settled cost report,
rather than the final settled cost report. In addition, instead
of reverting to a statewide cost-to-charge ratio, the rule would
require, in most cases, the use of hospital-specific ratios. The
proposed rule would authorize CMS, by means of a reconciliation
process in the Medicare cost report, to recoup retroactively any
past outlier overpayments plus interest or return any
underpayments with interest. The proposed rule does not alter
the current outlier threshold amount of $33,560, but CMS has
indicated plans to review inpatient claims data for the first
quarter of Federal fiscal year 2003 to determine whether an
adjustment may be warranted.

HCA recorded $284 million and
$240 million of revenues related to Medicare operating
outlier cases for 2002 and 2001, respectively. These amounts
represent 5.1% and 4.7% of HCA’s Medicare revenues and 1.4%
and 1.3% of HCA’s total revenues for 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Because the Federal investigations of certain of
the Company’s business practices resulted in the
curtailment of processing settlements of HCA’s cost
reports, the cost-to-charge ratios for HCA’s hospitals have
not been updated on a routine basis. As a result, the negative
impact of the CMS proposed outlier rule changes will be greater.
HCA is unable to predict whether there will be any changes to
the provisions of the proposed rule in the finalized rule, when
the new rule will become effective or what, if any, updates will
be made to the outlier payment provisions for the



Federal fiscal year beginning October 1,
2003. However, if the outlier payment provisions are finalized
as currently proposed and the Company does not experience
changes in Medicare patient acuity levels, then the
Company’s monthly revenue from outlier payments may be
reduced by up to $12 million.

CMS has requested that comments be submitted by
April 4, 2003 on the proposed outlier rule changes. The Company
is aware that major hospital industry associations, including
the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American
Hospitals, plan to submit comment letters to CMS requesting
significant changes in the proposal that would lessen the
financial impact of the final outlier rules. Such hospital
industry recommended changes are expected to include
implementation of a transition period for hospitals adversely
affected by these outlier policy changes and the lowering of the
outlier threshold simultaneous with any interim-year rule
change. The Company cannot predict if any of the industry’s
comments will be effected in the final outlier rule.

Outpatient

Traditionally, outpatient services provided at
general, acute care hospitals were reimbursed by Medicare at the
lower of customary charges, a blend of fee schedule amounts and
costs that are subject to limits, or actual costs, subject to
limits. On August 1, 2000, CMS began reimbursing hospital
outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services
furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on
a PPS basis. CMS will continue to use existing fee schedules to
pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable
medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services and
nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics. Freestanding surgery
centers are reimbursed on a fee schedule.

All PPS based hospital outpatient services are
classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications
(“APCs”). Services in each APC are similar clinically
and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
The implementation of updated APC rates for calendar year 2002
was delayed due to the timing of CMS’s issuance of final
regulations to correct significant technical errors that
impacted all APCs. The updated rates for calendar year 2002 were
implemented for services furnished on or after April 1,
2002. Calendar year 2001 APC rates were used for services
provided prior to April 1, 2002. Under BIPA, the update,
effective April 1, 2002, for 2002 was market basket of 3.3%
minus 1% (or 2.3%). The update for 2003 is market basket of 3.5%.

For calendar year 2002, the Medicare program set
aside 2.5% of APC payments to pay for certain approved medical
devices, drugs, and biologicals on a pass-through basis. As part
of the update process, CMS estimated that pass-through payments
for 2002 would be considerably in excess of the 2.5% set aside
if payments were continued at the current levels for
pass-through medical devices. To correct for this estimated
overpayment in calendar year 2002, CMS issued final regulations
that made significant changes to pass-through device payments
for services furnished on or after April 1, 2002, including
a pro-rata reduction of 63.6%. For calendar year 2003, CMS set
aside 2.3% of APC payments to pay for certain approved medical
devices, drugs, and biologicals on a pass-through basis, and CMS
did not make a pro-rata reduction for such pass-through payments.

Rehabilitation

PPS for rehabilitation hospitals and
rehabilitation units of hospitals was implemented for Medicare
cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2002.
Hospitals and units with cost reporting periods beginning prior
to October 1, 2002 could elect to be paid under PPS or a
blend of PPS and the facility-specific payment rates. Cost
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002 are
to be paid under PPS. Under PPS, patients are classified into
case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities and
functional capability. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities are
paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
For Federal fiscal year 2003, CMS updated the PPS rate for
rehabilitation hospitals and units by market basket of 3%. As of
December 31, 2002, HCA had two rehabilitation hospitals,
one of which is operated through a joint venture, and 51
hospital rehabilitation units.



Other

Payments to PPS-exempt hospitals and units
(

e.g.

, inpatient psychiatric and rehabilitation for cost
reporting periods beginning prior to January 1, 2002) are
currently based upon reasonable cost, subject to a cost per
discharge target (the TEFRA limits). These limits are updated
annually by a market basket index. The update to a
hospital’s target amount for its cost reporting period
beginning in fiscal year 2002 is a range of 0% to 3.3%,
depending on the hospital’s or unit’s costs in
relation to its rate-of-increase limit. The update to a
hospital’s target amount for its cost reporting period
beginning in fiscal year 2003 is market basket of 3.5%.
Furthermore, caps have been established for the cost per
discharge target at the 75th percentile for each category of
PPS-exempt hospitals and units. Effective for cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, payments to
these PPS-exempt hospitals and units are no longer subject to
these caps. The cost per discharge for new hospitals and
hospital units cannot exceed 110% of the national median target
rate for hospitals in the same category.

The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget
Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”) required CMS to
develop and implement budget-neutral PPS systems for both
psychiatric and long-term hospitals for cost reporting periods
beginning on or after October 1, 2002. CMS has announced
plans to implement PPS for psychiatric hospitals during 2004. As
of December 31, 2002, HCA had six psychiatric hospitals and
44 hospital psychiatric units.

CMS implemented PPS for long-term care hospitals
effective with cost reporting periods beginning on or after
October 1, 2002, with a five-year transition period. Thus,
long-term care hospitals will be paid under the full Federal
prospective rate for cost reporting periods beginning on or
after October 1, 2006. However, during the transition
period, a long-term care hospital may elect to be paid based on
100% of the Federal prospective rate. Under PPS, long-term care
hospitals will be paid based upon long-term care DRGs. During
Federal fiscal year 2003, long-term care PPS will be
“budget neutral,” that is, total payments for
long-term care hospitals during Federal fiscal year 2003 will be
projected to equal payments that would have been paid for
operating and capital-related costs of long-term care hospitals
had this new payment system not been enacted. HCA had one
long-term care hospital as of December 31, 2002.

Historically, Medicare reimbursed skilled nursing
facilities on the basis of actual costs, subject to certain
limits. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”)
required the establishment of a prospective payment system for
Medicare skilled nursing facilities under which facilities are
paid a per diem rate for virtually all covered services. This
payment system was phased in over three cost reporting periods,
starting with cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 1998. BBRA and BIPA made changes to the skilled
nursing facilities payment rates, which impacted the BBA-97
provisions in a manner favorable to HCA. As of December 31,
2002, HCA had 35 skilled nursing units.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the
Federal government and the states and are administered by states
under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are
made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with
individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than
a hospital’s cost of services. The Federal government and
many states are currently considering altering the level of
Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
eligibility in a manner that could adversely affect future
levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by HCA’s
hospitals. As permitted by law, certain states in which HCA
operates have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund their
Medicaid programs.

Annual
Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
revenue, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients. CMS has extended filing due dates for cost reports
as a result of problems it has experienced with updating the
payment reports used to complete cost reports. CMS recently
announced a revised schedule of



filing deadlines that range from May 2002 to
April 2003. In the meantime, HCA’s hospitals continue to
receive interim payments from CMS but these payments are not yet
subject to any adjustment based upon actual costs.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare
and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may
result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be
due to HCA under these reimbursement programs. These audits
often require several years to reach the final determination of
amounts due to HCA under these programs. Providers also have
rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in
audits of prior years’ reports.

During March 2002, HCA and CMS reached an
understanding pursuant to which the Company has agreed to pay
CMS $250 million for settlement of all CMS Medicare
reimbursement and payment issues regarding all HCA cost report,
home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS
related to cost report periods ended on or before July 31,
2001. HCA recorded an accrual for the $250 million settlement
payment in the December 31, 2001 consolidated financial
statements. The understanding with CMS is subject to approval by
the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), which has not yet
been obtained, and execution of a definitive written agreement.

During December 2002, an understanding was
reached by HCA and attorneys for the Civil Division of the DOJ.
Upon anticipated court approval, this understanding would result
in the dismissal of the various claims the DOJ had brought
against the Company related to physician relations, cost reports
and wound care issues and would effectively end the DOJ’s
investigation of the Company that was first made public in 1997.
The DOJ settlement is subject to DOJ’s approval of the CMS
understanding. As a result of this understanding, the Company
recorded a pretax charge of $603 million ($418 million
after-tax) in 2002. See Note 2 — Investigations and
Settlement of Certain Government Claims in the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

Managed
Care

Most of HCA’s hospitals offer discounts from
established charges to certain large group purchasers of health
care services, including Blue Cross, other private insurance
companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans.
HCA’s admissions attributable to managed care payers
decreased from 42% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
41% for the year ended December 31, 2001, and remained at
41% for the year ended December 31, 2002. HCA generally receives
lower payments for similar services from managed care payers
than from traditional commercial/indemnity insurers. Managed
care contracts are typically negotiated for one to two year
terms. While HCA has generally received average price increases
of five to eight percent from managed care payers during the
previous two years, there can be no assurance that HCA will
continue to receive increases in the future.

Hospital Utilization

HCA believes that the most important factors
relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the
quality and market position of the hospital and the number and
quality of physicians and other health care professionals
providing patient care within the facility. Generally, HCA
believes that the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is
determined by its breadth of services, level of technology,
emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and
physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the
growth in local population, local economic conditions and market
penetration of managed care programs.



The following table sets forth certain operating
statistics for HCA hospitals. Hospital operations are subject to
certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient
utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold
weather months.

(a)

Excludes six facilities in 2002, six facilities
    in 2001, nine facilities in 2000, 12 facilities in 1999 and 24
    facilities in 1998 that are not consolidated (accounted for
    using the equity method) for financial reporting purposes.

(b)

Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility
    has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state
    licensing agency.

(c)

Represents the average number of licensed beds,
    weighted based on periods owned.

(d)

Represents the total number of patients admitted
    to HCA’s hospitals and is used by management and certain
    investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(e)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and
    certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and
    outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by
    multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross
    inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing
    the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent
    admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to
    the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient
    volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and
    outpatient volume.

(f)

Represents the average number of days admitted
    patients stay in HCA’s hospitals.

(g)

Represents the average number of patients in
    HCA’s hospital beds each day.

(h)

Represents the percentage of hospital licensed
    beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and
    occupancy rate provide measures of the utilization of inpatient
    rooms.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local
communities served by most of HCA’s hospitals provide
services similar to those offered by HCA’s hospitals.
Additionally, in the past several years the number of
freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic centers (including
facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which
HCA operates has increased significantly. As a result, most of
HCA’s hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive
environment. The rates charged by HCA’s hospitals are
intended to be competitive with those charged by other local
hospitals for similar services. In some cases, competing
hospitals are more established than HCA’s hospitals. Some
competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported government
agencies and many others by not-for-profit entities that may be
supported by endowments and charitable contributions and are
exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions
and support are not available to HCA’s hospitals. In
addition, in certain localities served by HCA there are large
teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities,
equipment and services which may not be available at most of
HCA’s hospitals. Increasingly, HCA is facing competition by
physician-owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery
centers that compete for market share in high margin services.
Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas
outside their immediate locale and, therefore, HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional
hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute
care hospitals.

HCA’s strategies are designed to ensure
HCA’s hospitals are competitive. HCA believes that its
hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many
factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract



and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical
personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth
of services, technology offered and prices charged.

One of the most significant factors to the
competitive position of a hospital is the number and quality of
physicians affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may
at any time terminate their affiliation with a hospital operated
by HCA, the Company’s hospitals seek to retain physicians
of varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and
to attract other qualified physicians. HCA believes that
physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the
quality and scope of services it renders to patients and
physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the
location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s
facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, HCA strives to
maintain quality facilities, equipment, employees and services
for physicians and their patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position
of a hospital is management’s ability to negotiate service
contracts with purchasers of group health care services. HMOs
and PPOs attempt to direct and control the use of hospital
services through managed care programs and to obtain discounts
from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition,
employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly
interested in containing costs through negotiations with
hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from
established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for
service contracts with group health care services purchasers on
the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location,
quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and
convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed
care organizations varies from community to community depending
on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws,
which place limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand
hospital services and facilities, make capital expenditures and
otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect
of restricting competition. In those states which have no CON
laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before
they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the
form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more
prevalent. See Item 1: Business — Regulation and
Other Factors.

HCA, and the health care industry as a whole,
face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care
while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for
patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future
legislation, regulations and interpretations and competitive
contracting for provider services by private and government
payers remain ongoing challenges. These challenges may require
changes in HCA’s operations in the future.

Admissions and average lengths of stay continue
to be negatively affected by payer-required pre-admission
authorization, utilization review and by payer pressure to
maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery
services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition,
admissions constraints and payer pressures are expected to
continue. To meet these challenges, HCA intends to expand many
of its facilities to better enable the provision of a
comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer discounts to
private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and
offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and
    Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation
are subject to numerous Federal, state and local regulations
relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel,
operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate
records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with
building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are
subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other
authorities to assure continued compliance with the various
standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. HCA
believes that its health care facilities are properly licensed
under applicable state laws. Substantially all of HCA’s
general, acute care hospitals are certified for participation in
the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are accredited by the
Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(“Joint Commission”). Certain of HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals do not participate in these programs. If
any facility were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or
otherwise were to lose its certification under the Medicare and
Medicaid programs, the facility would be unable to receive
reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Management believes that HCA’s facilities are in
substantial compliance with



current applicable Federal, state, local and
independent review body regulations and standards. The
requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are
subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may be
necessary from time-to-time for HCA to make changes in its
facilities, equipment, personnel and services.

Certificates of Need

In some states where HCA operates hospitals, the
construction or expansion of health care facilities, the
acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be
subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory
agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the
reviewing state agency to determine the public need for
additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
change ownership.

State Rate Review

Some states where HCA operates hospitals have
adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for
hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
within the state. In the aggregate, state rate or budget review
and indigent tax provisions have not materially adversely
affected HCA’s results of operations.

Utilization Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed
to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and
Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and
are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are
properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a
sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be
reviewed by quality improvement organizations (formerly known as
PROs) to assess the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid
patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided,
the validity of DRG classifications and the appropriateness of
cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality
improvement organizations may deny payment for services
provided, may assess fines and also have the authority to
recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services
(“HHS”) that a provider which is in substantial
noncompliance with the appropriate standards be excluded from
participating in the Medicare program. Most non-governmental
managed care organizations also require utilization review.

Federal Health Care Program
    Regulations

Participation in any Federal health care program,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily
regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to
substantially comply with the numerous conditions of
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs
certain prohibited acts, the hospital’s participation in
the Federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil or
criminal penalties may be imposed under certain provisions of
the Social Security Act or both.

Anti-kickback Statute

Among these provisions is a section of the Social
Security Act known as the Anti-kickback Statute. This law
prohibits providers and others from soliciting, receiving,
offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration
with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services
or items covered by a Federal health care program. Courts have
interpreted this statute broadly. Violations of the
Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up
to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money
penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to
three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or
exclusion from participation in Federal health care programs,
including Medicare and Medicaid.

The Office of Inspector General at the Department
of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), among other
regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. In order to provide guidance to health care
providers, the OIG has from time to time issued “Special
Fraud Alerts” that



do not have the force of law, but identify
features of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that
the arrangements or transactions violate the Anti-kickback
Statute or other Federal health care laws. The OIG has
identified several incentive arrangements, which, if accompanied
by inappropriate intent, constitute suspect practices,
including: (a) payment of any incentive by the hospital
each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital,
(b) the use of free or significantly discounted office
space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the
hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted
billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training
for a physician’s office staff in areas such as management
techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which
provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a
predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or
loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to
the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a
physician’s travel and expenses for conferences,
(h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance
plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician,
(i) payment for services (which may include consultations
at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties
by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from
physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, or
(k) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, the
practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
the physician’s efforts. The OIG has encouraged persons
having information about hospitals who offer the above types of
incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published
final safe harbor regulations that outline categories of
activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the
Anti-kickback Statute. Currently there are statutory exceptions
and safe harbors for various activities, including the
following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
practitioner recruitment, personal services and management
contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that
conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe
harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business
arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. Such
conduct and business arrangements, however, may lead to
increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
Although the Company believes that its arrangements with
physicians have been structured to comply with current law and
available interpretations, there can be no assurance that
regulatory authorities that enforce these laws will not
determine that these financial arrangements violate the
Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. This
determination could subject the Company to liabilities under the
Social Security Act, including criminal penalties, civil
monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare,
Medicaid or other Federal health care programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision
commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law
effectively prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and
Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their
immediate family members have a financial relationship if these
entities provide certain designated health services that are
reimbursable by Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient
hospital services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include
denial of payment, refunding amounts received for services
provided pursuant to prohibited referrals, civil monetary
penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, and
exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute
also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a
circumvention scheme. There are exceptions to the self-referral
prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements
between physicians and providers, including employment
contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. There is also an
exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire
hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital
department.

On January 4, 2001, CMS issued final
regulations, subject to comment, intended to clarify parts of
the Stark Law and some of the exceptions to it. These
regulations are considered the first phase of a two-phase
process, with the remaining regulations to be published at an
unknown future date. The phase one regulations generally became
effective January 4, 2002. However, CMS has delayed until
July 7, 2003 the effective date of a portion of the phase
one regulations related to whether percentage-based compensation
is deemed to be



“set in advance” for purposes of
exceptions to the Stark Law. The Company cannot predict the
final form that these regulations will take or the effect that
the final regulations will have on its operations.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which HCA operates also have laws
that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals
similar to the Anti-kickback Statute and self-referral
legislation similar to the Stark Law. The scope of these state
laws is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the
source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for
their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically
provide for criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of
facility licensure.

HIPAA and BBA-97

The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the
scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal
provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all
health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against
incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare
beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive
services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms
to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity
Program and an incentive program under which individuals can
receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud
and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of
Medicare funds. Federal enforcement officials now have the
ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors,
officers and managing employees associated with business
entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the
officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud.
HIPAA was followed by BBA-97, which created additional fraud and
abuse provisions, including civil penalties for contracting with
an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know
is excluded from a Federal health care program.

Other Fraud and Abuse
    Provisions

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and
civil penalties for making false claims and statements to
Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited
to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting
actual services rendered in order to obtain higher
reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services, and
cost report fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed
for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure
to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements,
and offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid
beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider. Like the
Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Careful
and accurate coding of claims for reimbursement, as well as
accurately preparing cost reports, must be performed to avoid
liability.

Compliance with Medicare regulations and fraud
and abuse provisions are areas included in the ongoing
government investigation and litigation pertaining to the
Company. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State
    Laws

A factor affecting the health care industry today
is the use of the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular,
actions brought by individuals on the government’s behalf
under the False Claims Act’s

“qui tam,”

or
whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow
private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government
alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal
government.

Qui tam

actions are among the types of
lawsuits faced by HCA. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law
to be liable under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be
required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the
government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and
$11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential
bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often
arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for
reimbursement to the Federal government. The False Claims Act
defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Thus, although
simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the
False Claims Act, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to
its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing”
submission under the False Claims Act and, therefore, will
qualify for liability.



In some cases, whistleblowers and the Federal
government have taken the position that providers who allegedly
have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute
and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the
False Claims Act. A number of states in which HCA operates have
adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own
whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a
civil lawsuit in state court.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and
    Privacy Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of
HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission
standards for health care claims and payment transactions
submitted or received electronically. These provisions are
intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care
industry. On August 17, 2000, HHS published final
regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards
that all health care providers must use when submitting or
receiving certain health care transactions electronically.
Compliance with these regulations became mandatory on
October 16, 2002. However, entities that filed for an
extension before October 16, 2002 have until
October 16, 2003 to comply with the regulations. HCA’s
facilities filed for the extension before October 16, 2002, and
HCA anticipates that HCA’s facilities will be in compliance
with the standards by October 16, 2003. HCA believes that
the cost of compliance with these regulations will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position or
results of operations.

HIPAA also requires HHS to adopt standards to
protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable
health-related information. HHS released final regulations
containing privacy standards in December 2000 and published
revisions to the final regulations in August 2002. Compliance
with these regulations is required by April 14, 2003. The
privacy regulations will extensively regulate the use and
disclosure of individually identifiable health-related
information, whether communicated electronically, on paper or
orally. The regulations also provide patients with significant
new rights related to understanding and controlling how their
health information is used or disclosed. HHS released final
security regulations on February 20, 2003. The security
regulations will become mandatory on April 20, 2005 and
will require health care providers to implement administrative,
physical and technical practices to protect the security of
individually identifiable health information that is maintained
or transmitted electronically. The privacy regulations and
security regulations, when fully implemented, could impose
significant costs on HCA’s facilities in order to comply
with these standards.

Violations of HIPAA could result in civil
penalties of up to $25,000 per type of violation in each
calendar year and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per
violation. In addition, there are numerous legislative and
regulatory initiatives at the Federal and state levels
addressing patient privacy concerns. Facilities will continue to
remain subject to any Federal or state privacy-related laws that
are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under
HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties.

EMTALA

All of HCA’s hospitals are subject to the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”). This Federal law requires any hospital
that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an
appropriate medical screening examination of every person who
presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment
and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical
condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an
appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can
handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize
emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a
patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe
penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or
appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital
delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the
patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of
EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured
patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that
suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another
hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit
against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover
situations in which patients do not actually present to a
hospital’s emergency room but present for treatment to the
hospital’s campus generally or to a



hospital-based clinic or are transported in a
hospital-owned ambulance. The government also has expressed its
intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in
the future. Moreover, patients are increasingly including EMTALA
violation allegations in malpractice lawsuits. The Company
believes HCA’s hospitals operate in substantial compliance
with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee
    Splitting

Some of the states in which HCA operates have
laws that prohibit corporations and other entities from
employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or
that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that
are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to,
or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical
products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these
restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal
penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and
the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These
statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have
seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has
focused in recent years on the hospital industry. While HCA is
currently not aware of any material new investigations of the
Company, it is possible that governmental entities could
initiate investigations or litigation in the future at
facilities operated by HCA and that such matters could result in
significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also
possible that HCA’s executives and managers could be
included in governmental investigations or litigation or named
as defendants in private litigation.

The Company’s substantial Medicare, Medicaid
and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of
its operations. The Company continues to monitor all aspects of
its business and has developed a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
Federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in
this area is complex and constantly evolving, ongoing or future
governmental investigations or litigation may result in
interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices,
including the Company’s. The Company is currently the
subject of various Federal and state investigations and
litigation. See Item 3: Legal Proceedings.

Health Care Reform

Health care, as one of the largest industries in
the United States, continues to attract much legislative
interest and public attention. In recent years, various
legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in
Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major
changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the
state level. Many states have enacted or are considering
enacting measures designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures
and change private health care insurance. Most states, including
the states in which HCA operates, have applied for and been
granted Federal waivers from current Medicaid regulations to
allow them to serve some or all of their Medicaid participants
through managed care providers.

Compliance Program and Corporate Integrity
    Agreement

HCA maintains a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
Federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is
intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory
issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of
complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the
ethics and compliance program, HCA provides annual ethics and
compliance training to its employees and encourages all
employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an
ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics
line.

In January 2001, HCA entered into an eight year
Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG.
The CIA is structured to assure the Federal government of
HCA’s overall Federal health care program compliance and
specifically covers DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and
physician relations. The CIA also included testing for
outpatient laboratory billing in 2001, which was replaced with
skilled nursing facilities



billing beginning in 2003. Under the CIA, HCA has
an affirmative obligation to report potential violations of
applicable Federal heath care laws and regulations and has,
pursuant to this obligation, reported a number of potential
technical violations of the Stark and EMTALA laws. This
obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory
authorities. The government waived excluding any of HCA’s
operations from participation in the Medicare program for Civil
and Administrative Settlement Agreement issues. See Item 3:
Legal Proceedings. However, breach of the CIA could subject HCA
to substantial monetary penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Conversion Legislation

Many states have enacted or are considering
enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit
hospitals. These laws, in general, include provisions relating
to attorney general approval, advance notification and community
involvement. In addition, state attorneys general in states
without specific conversion legislation may exercise authority
over these transactions based upon existing law. In many states
there has been an increased interest in the oversight of
not-for-profit conversions. The adoption of conversion
legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital
conversions may limit HCA’s ability to grow through
acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.

Revenue Ruling 98-15

In March 1998, the IRS issued guidance regarding
the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and
not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax ruling, the IRS
has proposed and may in the future propose to revoke the
tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit
entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat
joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income. HCA
is continuing to review the impact of the tax ruling on its
existing joint ventures and the development of future joint
ventures, and is consulting with its joint venture partners and
tax advisers to develop appropriate courses of action. In
January 2001, a not-for-profit entity which participates in a
joint venture with HCA filed a refund suit in Federal District
Court seeking to recover taxes, interest and penalties assessed
by the IRS in connection with the IRS’s proposed revocation
of the not-for-profit entity’s tax-exempt status. In 2002,
a Federal court granted the entity’s claim for refund and
upheld its tax-exempt status. The IRS has appealed that
decision. In the event that the not-for-profit entity’s
tax-exempt status was upheld, the IRS had proposed to treat the
not-for-profit entity’s share of joint venture income as
unrelated business taxable income. HCA is not a party to this
lawsuit.

The tax ruling has limited development of joint
ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts
regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a
not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture
income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit
joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or
require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures
with not-for-profits.

Antitrust Laws

The Federal government and most states have
enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct
deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing,
concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price
discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors
and other practices that have or may have an adverse effect on
competition. Violations of Federal or state antitrust laws can
result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. HCA
believes it is in compliance with such Federal and state laws,
but there can be no assurance that a review of HCA’s
practices by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in
a determination that could adversely affect HCA’s
operations.

Environmental Matters

HCA is subject to various Federal, state and
local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment. Management does not believe that
HCA will be required to expend any



material amounts in order to comply with these
laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect
its capital expenditures, results of operations or financial
condition.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, HCA is
subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary
course of business. The health care industry continues to see a
significant increase in malpractice insurance expense due to
unfavorable pricing and availability trends in the professional
liability markets and an increase in the size and severity of
claim settlements. HCA expects this trend to continue unless
meaningful tort reform or other legislation is enacted.

Through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, HCA
insures a substantial portion of its professional liability
risks. HCA’s facilities are insured by the insurance
subsidiary for losses of up to $25 million per occurrence.
Professional liability risks above a $6.8 million retention per
occurrence for 2001 and a $10 million retention per occurrence
for 2002 were reinsured with unrelated commercial carriers. The
insurance subsidiary obtained no reinsurance for 2003 and as a
result will be responsible for all professional liability risks.
HCA also maintains professional liability insurance with
unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts
insured by its insurance subsidiary. HCA and its insurance
subsidiary maintain reserves for professional liability risks
that totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002.
Management considers such reserves, which are based on
actuarially determined estimates, to be adequate for such
liability risks.

HCA maintains its directors and officers,
property and other typical coverages with unrelated commercial
carriers. The Company continues to see significant price
increases in directors and officers liability, property and
other coverages.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2002, HCA had approximately
178,000 employees, including approximately 52,000 part-time
employees. HCA is subject to various state and Federal laws that
regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions
relating to employment. Employees at ten hospitals are
represented by various labor unions. HCA considers its employee
relations to be satisfactory. HCA’s hospitals are
experiencing an increase in union organizational activity,
particularly in California. However, the Company does not expect
such efforts to materially affect its future operations.
HCA’s hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced
labor costs rising faster than the general inflation rate. In
some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability
has become a significant operating issue to health care
providers. To address this challenge, HCA has implemented
several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting,
compensation programs and productivity. This shortage may also
require an increase in the utilization of more expensive
temporary personnel. References herein to “employees”
refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Licensed physicians who have been accepted to the
medical staff of individual hospitals staff HCA’s
hospitals. With certain exceptions, physicians generally are not
employees of HCA’s hospitals. However, some physicians
provide services in HCA’s hospitals under contracts which
generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the
duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation
for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be
accepted to the medical staff of any of HCA’s hospitals,
but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate
governing board of the hospital in accordance with established
credentialing criteria must approve acceptance to the staff.
Members of the medical staffs of HCA’s hospitals often also
serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate
their affiliation with a hospital at any time.

Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following
risks were to occur, HCA’s business, financial position,
results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be
materially adversely affected. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed
immaterial by HCA may also constrain its business and
operations. In either case, the trading price of HCA’s
common stock could decline and stockholders could lose all or
part of their investment.



HCA Continues To Be The Subject Of
    Governmental Investigations, Claims And Litigation That Could
    Result In Sanctions And Judgments.

HCA continues to be the subject of governmental
investigations and litigation relating to its business
practices. Additionally, HCA is a defendant in several

qui
tam

actions brought by private parties
(“relators”) on behalf of the United States of America.

In December 2000, HCA entered into a Plea
Agreement with the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice and various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (the “Plea
Agreement”) and a Civil and Administrative Settlement
Agreement with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice
(the “Civil Agreement”). HCA paid the government $840
million (plus $60 million of accrued interest), as provided by
the Civil Agreement and Plea Agreement, during 2001. HCA also
entered into a CIA with the OIG of the Department of Health and
Human Services which requires HCA to report to the OIG potential
violations of law applicable to Federal health care programs.

In March 2002, HCA announced that it had reached
an understanding with CMS to resolve all Medicare cost report,
home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS
(the “CMS Understanding”). The CMS Understanding
provides that HCA would pay CMS $250 million with respect to
these matters. The CMS Understanding is subject to approval by
the DOJ, which has not yet been obtained, and execution of a
definitive written agreement.

In December 2002, HCA reached an understanding
with attorneys for the Civil Division of the DOJ to recommend an
agreement whereby the United States would dismiss the various
claims it had brought in the physician relations, cost reports
and wound care cases (the “DOJ Understanding”) in
exchange for a payment of $631 million, with interest accruing
from February 3, 2003 to the payment date at a rate of 4.5%. The
DOJ settlement is subject to DOJ’s approval of the CMS
Understanding. The Company also reached an agreement in
principle with a negotiating team representing states that may
have similar claims against the Company. Under this agreement,
the Company would pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid
agencies to resolve any such claims. In addition, the Company
will be obligated by law to pay reasonable legal fees of the
relators’ attorneys.

The CMS Understanding and the DOJ Understanding
are both subject to approval and the execution of definitive
agreements and there are several

qui tam

cases in which
the government has not intervened that are not covered by the
DOJ Understanding. Management recognizes that the amounts that
have been accrued must continue to be reassessed as the approval
processes and execution of definitive agreements activities
continue and new information becomes available. The amounts
claimed and the amounts the Company has accrued are substantial
and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could require
adjustments to the amounts recorded or additional liability
accruals that could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations, financial position and
liquidity.

HCA remains the subject of a formal order of
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. HCA
understands that the investigation includes the anti-fraud,
insider trading, periodic reporting and internal accounting
control provisions of the Federal securities laws.

HCA continues to cooperate in the governmental
investigations. Given the scope of the investigations and
current litigation, HCA anticipates continued investigative
activity may occur in the ongoing investigations and litigation
as well as other proceedings that may be initiated.

While management remains unable to predict the
outcome of any of the investigations and litigation or the
initiation of any additional investigations or litigation, were
HCA to be found in violation of Federal or state laws relating
to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or breach of the CIA,
HCA could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil and
criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or expenses
could have a material adverse effect on HCA’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. See
Note 2 — Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims and Note 11 — Contingencies in
the notes to consolidated financial statements.



If HCA Fails To Comply With Extensive Laws And
    Government Regulations, It Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required
    To Make Significant Changes To Its Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply
with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the Federal,
state and local government levels relating to, among other
things:

Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute
and the Stark Law. These laws impact the relationships that HCA
may have with physicians and other referral sources. HCA has a
variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer
patients to its hospitals, including employment contracts,
leases and professional service agreements. HCA also provides
financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to
recruit physicians into the communities served by its hospitals.
The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline
practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the
Anti-kickback Statute. A number of HCA’s current financial
relationships with physicians and other referral sources do not
qualify for safe harbor protection under the Anti-kickback
Statute. While the Company endeavors to comply with the
applicable safe harbors, certain of the Company’s current
arrangements, including joint ventures, do not qualify for safe
harbor protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean
that the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback
Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
HCA cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe
harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute.

HCA’s financial relationships with
physicians and their immediate family members must comply with
the Stark Law by meeting an exception. HCA attempts to structure
its relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the
regulations implementing the exceptions, some of which are still
under review, are detailed and complex, and HCA cannot assure
that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

If HCA fails to comply with the Anti-kickback
Statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations,
it could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal
penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of its licenses
to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more
facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and
other Federal and state health care programs. See Item 1:
Business — Regulation and Other Factors.

Because many of these laws and regulations are
relatively new, HCA does not always have the benefit of
significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject
HCA’s current or past practices to allegations of
impropriety or illegality or could require HCA to make changes
in its facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital
expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination
that HCA has violated these laws, or the public announcement
that it is being investigated for possible violations of these
laws, could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects and
HCA’s business reputation could suffer significantly. In
addition, HCA is unable to predict whether other



legislation or regulations at the Federal or
state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or
regulations may take or their impact.

HCA Is Subject To Uncertainties Regarding
    Health Care Reform.

In recent years, an increasing number of
legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in
Congress and in state legislatures that would result in major
changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the
state level. Among the proposals that have been introduced are
price controls on hospitals, insurance market reforms to
increase the availability of group health insurance to small
businesses, requirements that all businesses offer health
insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a
government health insurance plan or plans that would cover all
citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries. HCA cannot
predict whether any of the above proposals or any other
proposals will be adopted, and if adopted, no assurance can be
given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial position or
results of operations.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For
    Patients From Other Hospitals And Health Care
    Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive
and competition among hospitals and other health care providers
for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other
hospitals in the local communities served by most of HCA’s
hospitals provide services similar to those offered by
HCA’s hospitals. In addition, the number of freestanding
specialty hospitals and surgery and diagnostic centers in the
geographic areas in which HCA operates has increased
significantly. As a result, most of HCA’s hospitals operate
in an increasingly competitive environment. Some of the
hospitals that compete with HCA’s hospitals are owned by
governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported
by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance
capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis.
Increasingly, HCA is facing competition by physician-owned
specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery centers that
compete for market share in high margin services and for quality
physicians and personnel. If HCA’s competitors are better
able to attract patients, recruit physicians, expand services or
obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, HCA
may experience a decline in patient volume. See Item 1:
Business — Competition.

HCA’s Performance Depends On Its Ability
    To Recruit And Retain Quality Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of
hospital admissions and therefore the success of HCA’s
hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the
physicians on the medical staffs of its hospitals, the admitting
practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations
with those physicians. Physicians are generally not employees of
the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets
that HCA serves, most physicians have admitting privileges at
other hospitals in addition to HCA’s hospitals. Such
physicians may terminate their affiliation with HCA hospitals at
any time. If HCA is unable to provide adequate support personnel
or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities
that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged
from referring patients to HCA facilities, admissions may
decrease and HCA’s operating performance may decline.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For
    Staffing, Which May Increase Its Labor Costs And Reduce
    Profitability.

HCA’s operations are dependent on the
effort, abilities and experience of its management and medical
support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab
technicians, as well as its physicians. HCA competes with other
health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified
management and support personnel responsible for the day-to-day
operations of each of its hospitals, including nurses and other
non-physician health care professionals. In some markets, the
availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has
become a significant operating issue to health care providers.
This shortage may require HCA to continue to enhance wages and
benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support
personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. HCA
also depends on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and
unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates.
If HCA’s labor costs increase, it may not be able to raise
rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant
percentage of HCA’s revenues consist of fixed,



prospective payments, its ability to pass along
increased labor costs is constrained. HCA’s failure to
recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other
medical support personnel, or to control its labor costs could
have a material adverse effect on HCA’s results of
operations.

Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce
    HCA’s Revenues.

A significant portion of HCA’s revenues is
derived from government health care programs, principally
Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to
frequent and substantial changes. HCA derived approximately 35%
of its patient revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs
in 2002. Legislative changes, including those enacted as part of
BBA-97, have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases,
reductions in levels of, payments to health care providers for
certain services under these government programs.

Many changes imposed by BBA-97 are being phased
in over a period of years. BBRA and BIPA are mitigating certain
rate reductions resulting from BBA-97. Nonetheless, BBA-97
significantly changed the method of payment under the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. This change resulted in significant
reductions in payments for HCA’s inpatient, outpatient, and
skilled nursing services. Recently, CMS published a proposed
rule that would modify the methodology for determining Medicare
outlier payments that could result in a significant reduction in
outlier payments the Company receives. In addition, a number of
states are experiencing budget problems and have adopted or are
considering legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid
expenditures. States have also adopted or are considering
legislation designed to provide universal coverage and
additional care. Such legislation includes reducing coverage and
program eligibility, enrolling Medicaid recipients in managed
care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help
finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Hospital
operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under
significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing
flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in
excess of the increase in PPS payments under the Medicare
program. Future legislation or other changes in the
administration or interpretation of government health programs
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operations of HCA.

Demands Of Non-government Payers May Adversely
    Affect HCA’s Growth in Revenues.

HCA’s ability to negotiate favorable
contracts with non-government payers including, HMOs, PPOs and
other managed care plans, significantly affects the revenues and
operating results of most of its hospitals. Patient revenues
derived from managed care payers accounted for approximately 44%
of HCA’s patient revenues in 2002. Non-government payers,
including managed care payers, increasingly are demanding
discounted fee structures. Failure to pay or reductions in price
increases or the amounts received from managed care, commercial
insurance or other payers could have a material adverse effect
on the financial position and results of operations of HCA.

Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services
    May Reduce HCA’s Revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payers designed
to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to
as “utilization review,” have affected and are
expected to continue to affect HCA’s facilities.
Utilization review entails the review of the admission and
course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy
rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required
pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payer
pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care
delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to
impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
Although HCA is unable to predict the effect these changes will
have on its operations, significant limits on the scope of
services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
have a material adverse effect on HCA’s business, financial
position and results of operations.

HCA’s Shared Services And Other
    Initiatives May Not Achieve Anticipated Efficiencies.

HCA’s strategy includes controlling the cost
of providing services. HCA is implementing shared services
initiatives designed to increase revenue, accelerate cash flows
and reduce operating costs by consolidating



hospitals’ back-office functions such as
billing, collections and purchasing. HCA has developed ten
regional patient account services (“PAS”) centers
located in the Company’s major regional markets. The PASs
provide the business office services that were previously
performed in each facility and provide a setting to better
utilize experienced personnel, share best practices and handle
volumes of transactions more efficiently through stratification
and specialization. HCA has implemented supply improvement and
distribution programs that include consolidating purchasing
functions regionally, combining warehouses and developing
division-based procurement programs. HCA has expended
significant sums to build and implement these shared services
initiatives. There can be no assurance that HCA’s financial
business processes will not be interrupted during implementation
of the shared services or other initiatives or that HCA will be
able to realize the anticipated efficiencies from these
initiatives.

HCA is implementing other initiatives to
standardize and upgrade its patient accounting, financial and
human resources information systems. The most significant
information system initiative currently in process is the
internal development of a new patient accounting (revenue and
accounts receivable) information system. The millennium accounts
receivable system (“MARS”) is being developed by a
team of HCA personnel and external consultants. Management
estimates that the MARS project will require total expenditures
of approximately $390 million to develop and install. At
December 31, 2002, project-to-date costs incurred were
$98.2 million ($89.5 million of the costs incurred
have been capitalized and $8.7 million have been expensed).
Management expects that the software system development will be
completed during 2004 and that system testing, data conversion
and installation will continue through 2007. The internal
development of a software system of this magnitude is a complex
and time-consuming process that requires long development and
testing periods. Revisions or enhancements may be identified
that are not currently included in the project scope and could
extend the project development timing and cost. HCA is also in
the process of implementing an enterprise resource planning
(“ERP”) system to replace its financial and human
resources information systems and reporting process. The ERP
system is designed to improve the integration among the
Company’s various software systems and allow for more
efficient collecting, sharing and analyzing of data. The ERP
system should provide more flexibility to format reports to fit
facilities’ needs and allow employees to use their personal
computers to gather and analyze information. Management
estimates that the ERP project will require total expenditures
of approximately $320 million to develop and install. At
December 31, 2002, project-to-date costs incurred were
$152.1 million ($97.0 million of the costs incurred
have been capitalized and $55.1 million have been
expensed). Management expects that the ERP system development,
testing, data conversion and installation will continue through
2006. There can be no assurance that the development and
implementation of MARS and/or ERP will not be delayed, that the
total cost will not be significantly more than currently
anticipated, that business processes will not be interrupted
during implementation or that HCA will realize the expected
benefits and efficiencies from the developed products.

HCA’s
Operations Could Be Impaired by a Failure of the Company’s
Information Systems

The performance of HCA’s sophisticated
information technology and systems is critical to HCA’s
business operations. In addition to HCA’s shared services
initiatives, HCA’s information systems are essential to a
number of critical areas of the Company’s business
operations, including:

Any system failure that causes an interruption in
service or availability of HCA’s systems could adversely
affect operations or delay the collection of revenue. Even
though HCA has implemented network security measures, the
Company’s servers are vulnerable to computer viruses,
break-ins and similar disruptions from



unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of
these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or
corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of
systems, all of which could have a material adverse effect on
the financial position and results of operations of HCA and harm
HCA’s business reputation.

State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or
    Expansion Of Hospitals Could Impair HCA’s Ability To
    Operate And Expand Its Operations.

Some states require health care providers to
obtain prior approval, known as a CON, for the purchase,
construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make
certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or
bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need
for additional or expanded health care facilities or services.
HCA currently operates hospitals in a number of states with CON
laws. The failure to obtain any required CON could impair
HCA’s ability to operate or expand operations.

HCA’s Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated
    In Florida And Texas, Which Makes The Company Sensitive To
    Regulatory, Economic And Competitive Changes In Those
    States.

Of 179 hospitals at December 31, 2002, 77
are located in Florida and Texas, which makes HCA particularly
sensitive to regulatory, economic, and competition changes in
those states. Any material change in the current regulatory,
economic or competitive conditions in these states could have a
disproportionate effect on the Company’s overall business
results.

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities Because of
    Claims By The IRS.

HCA is currently contesting claims for income
taxes and related interest proposed by the IRS for prior years
aggregating approximately $319 million through
December 31, 2002. The disputed items include the amount of
gain or loss recognized on the divestiture of certain non-core
business units in 1998 and the allocation of costs to fixed
assets and goodwill in connection with hospitals acquired by HCA
in 1995 and 1996. During 2002, the IRS began an examination of
HCA’s 1999 through 2000 Federal income tax returns. HCA is
presently unable to estimate the amount of any additional income
tax and interest that the IRS may claim upon completion of this
examination or any future examinations that may be initiated by
the IRS.

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims
    Brought Against Its Facilities.

HCA is subject to significant litigation relating
to its business practices including claims and legal actions by
patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging
malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. See
Item 3: Legal Proceedings. Many of these actions involve
large claims and significant defense costs. HCA insures a
substantial portion of its professional and general liability
risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary, in amounts management
believes are sufficient to cover claims arising out of the
operation of HCA’s facilities. HCA’s wholly-owned
insurance subsidiary historically has entered into certain
reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the
reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the
subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do
not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. Some
of the claims, however, could exceed the maximum insurance
coverage, may not be covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if
any, could fail to meet their obligations. The insurance
subsidiary did not obtain reinsurance for 2003. If payments for
claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered
by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their
obligations, the results of operations and financial position of
HCA could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and
    Other Factors May Result in Decreases in Our Stock
    Price

In recent periods, the stock markets have
experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to
the operating performance of particular companies. These broad
market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of
our common stock. From time to time, there may be significant
volatility in the market price of our common stock. If we are
unable to operate our hospitals as profitably as we have in the
past, investors could sell shares of our common stock at or
after the time that it becomes apparent that the expectations of
the market may not be realized, resulting in a decrease in the
market price of our common stock.



In addition to our operating results, the
operating results of other hospital companies, changes in
financial estimates or recommendations by analysts, changes in
government health care programs, governmental investigations and
litigation, speculation in the press or investment community,
the possible affects of war, terrorist and other hostilities,
adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses,
changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial
markets or other developments affecting the health care
industry, could cause the market price of our common stock to
fluctuate substantially.

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number
of hospitals (general, acute care and psychiatric), directly or
indirectly, owned and operated by the Company as of
December 31, 2002:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above
table, HCA, directly or indirectly operates 78 freestanding
surgery centers. HCA also operates medical office buildings in
conjunction with some of its hospitals. These office buildings
are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at HCA’s
hospitals.

HCA owns and maintains its headquarters in
approximately 828,000 square feet of space in five office
buildings in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to the
headquarters in Nashville, HCA owns and maintains service
centers related to the Company’s shared services
initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
which the Company operates hospitals.

HCA’s headquarters, hospitals and other
facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in
general, adequate for HCA’s present needs. HCA’s
properties are subject to various Federal, state and local
statutes and ordinances regulating their operation. Management
does not believe that compliance with such statutes and
ordinances will materially affect HCA’s financial position
or results from operations.



Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

The Company is facing significant legal
challenges. The Company is the subject of various government
investigations and litigation,

qui tam

actions,
shareholder derivative and class action suits filed in Federal
court, shareholder derivative actions filed in state court,
patient/payer actions and general liability claims.

Government Investigations, Claims and
Litigation

While HCA is not aware of any material new
investigations of the Company, HCA continues to be the subject
of the following governmental investigations and litigation
relating to its business practices. The governmental
investigations were initiated more than five years ago and
include activities for certain entities for periods prior to
their acquisition by the Company and activities for certain
entities that have been divested. Additionally, HCA is a
defendant in several

qui tam

actions brought by private
parties (“relators”) on behalf of the United States of
America.

In December 2000, HCA entered into a Plea
Agreement with the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice and various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (the “Plea
Agreement”) and a Civil and Administrative Settlement
Agreement with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice
(the “Civil Agreement”). The agreements resolved all
Federal criminal issues outstanding against HCA and certain
issues involving Federal civil claims by or on behalf of the
government against HCA relating to DRG coding, outpatient
laboratory billing and home health issues. The civil issues that
were not covered by the Civil Agreement include claims related
to cost reports and physician relations issues. The Civil
Agreement was approved by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia in August 2001. HCA paid the government
$840 million (plus $60 million of accrued interest), as provided
by the Civil Agreement and Plea Agreement, during 2001. HCA also
entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”)
with the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health
and Human Services.

On March 28, 2002, HCA announced that it had
reached an understanding with CMS to resolve all Medicare cost
report, home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA
and CMS (the “CMS Understanding”). The CMS
Understanding provides that HCA would pay CMS $250 million with
respect to these matters. The CMS Understanding was reached as a
means to resolve all outstanding appeals and more than 2,600 HCA
cost reports for cost report periods ended on or before July 31,
2001, many of which CMS has yet to audit. The CMS Understanding
is subject to approval by the Department of Justice
(“DOJ”), which has not yet been obtained, and
execution of a definitive written agreement.

In December 2002, HCA reached an understanding
with attorneys for the Civil Division of the Department of
Justice to recommend an agreement whereby the United States
would dismiss the various claims it had brought in the physician
relations, cost reports and wound care cases (the “DOJ
Understanding”) in exchange for a payment of $631 million,
with interest accruing from February 3, 2003 to the payment date
at a rate of 4.5%. The Company also reached an agreement in
principle with a negotiating team representing states that may
have similar claims against the Company. Under this agreement,
the Company would pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid agencies
to resolve any such claims. In addition, the Company will be
obligated by law to pay reasonable legal fees of the
relators’ attorneys.

The DOJ Understanding would result in the
dismissal of the

Alderson, Schilling, Thompson, Mroz, King,
Parslow and Lanni

cases described below in their entirety.
In addition, the claims brought by the relator in the

Pogue

case would be dismissed, as would the
Government’s claims in the

Marine

case described
below. The DOJ Understanding is subject to court approval and is
further conditioned upon approval by DOJ of the CMS
Understanding. Any of the relators in the matters described
above could object to the proposed settlement and have those
objections considered by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia. The DOJ Understanding, if approved, would
effectively end the DOJ’s investigation of the Company that
was first made public in 1997. The

qui tam

cases
described below in which the government has not intervened,
other than the

Pogue

case as noted, would not be affected
by the DOJ Understanding. The CIA previously entered into by the
Company would remain in effect.



Under the Civil Agreement, HCA’s existing
Letter of Credit Agreement with the DOJ was reduced from $1
billion to $250 million at the time of the settlement payment.
Upon the Company making the payments provided under the DOJ
Understanding, the Company would no longer have any remaining
obligation to maintain letters of credit with the DOJ.

HCA remains the subject of a formal order of
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. HCA
understands that the investigation includes the anti-fraud,
insider trading, periodic reporting and internal accounting
control provisions of the Federal securities laws.

HCA continues to cooperate in the governmental
investigations. Given the scope of the investigations and
current litigation, HCA anticipates continued investigative
activity may occur in the ongoing investigations and litigation
as well as other proceedings that may be instituted.

While management remains unable to predict the
outcome of any of the investigations and litigation or the
initiation of any additional investigations or litigation, were
HCA to be found in violation of Federal or state laws relating
to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or breach of the CIA,
HCA could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil and
criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or expenses
could have a material adverse effect on HCA’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. See
Note 2 — Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims and Note 11 — Contingencies in
the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Lawsuits

Qui Tam
Actions

Several

qui tam

actions have been brought
by relators on behalf of the United States and have been
unsealed and served on the Company. The actions allege, in
general, that the Company and certain affiliates violated the
False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729,

et seq.

, for
improper claims submitted to the government for reimbursement.
The lawsuits generally seek damages of three times the amount of
Medicare or Medicaid claims (involving false claims) presented
by the defendants to the Federal government, civil penalties of
not less than $5,500 or more than $11,000 for each such Medicare
or Medicaid claim, attorneys’ fees and costs. In many
instances there are additional common law claims.

In February 1999, the United States filed a
motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
(“MDL”) seeking to transfer and consolidate, pursuant
to 28 U.S.C. 1407,

qui tam

actions against the
Company, including those sealed and unsealed, for purposes of
discovery and pretrial matters, to the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia. The MDL panel granted the
motion and all of the

qui tam

cases subject to the motion
have been consolidated to the U.S. District Court of the
District of Columbia

.

In January 2001, the District Court in the
District of Columbia entered an order establishing an initial
schedule for the consolidated

qui tam

cases. On
March 15, 2001, the government filed its notice of
intervention or notice declining intervention (where it had not
already declined intervention) in each

qui tam

action in
the MDL proceeding. In each case where the government
intervened, it served the complaint on the Company. In those
cases where the government declined intervention, the respective
relators were required to serve the complaint by the later of
March 15, 2001 or within 15 days after the
government’s notice declining intervention.

A. Qui Tam Actions in Which the United
States Has Intervened

The United States intervened in eight of the
consolidated cases, which fall generally in three categories:
(1) cost reports allegedly constituting false claims;
(2) alleged improper financial arrangements with physicians
to induce referrals; and (3) alleged false claims
pertaining to certain management fees paid to Curative Health
Services. Discovery in the intervened cases has been suspended
due to the proposed settlement.



1. Cost
Report Cases

In October 1998, the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Florida unsealed

United States ex rel.
Alderson v. Columbia/HCA, et al.,

Case
No. 97-2-35-CIV-T-23E. The case had been pending under seal
since 1993, and is a

qui tam

action alleging various
violations of the False Claims Act concerning the Company’s
claims for reimbursement under various Federal programs
including Medicare, Medicaid and other Federally funded
programs. The complaint focuses on the alleged creation of
certain cost report “reserves” in connection with the
preparation of hospital cost reports submitted for the purpose
of Federal reimbursement. On October 1, 1998, the
government intervened in this case and on March 15, 2001,
served an amended complaint on the Company. The Company filed an
answer and counterclaim in response to the complaint. The
counterclaim seeks payment which includes, but is not limited
to, certain amounts owed to the Company, with interest, for all
outstanding cost reports not settled by the government dating
back to cost report years ended in 1994 and thereafter. The
government has filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim. In
addition, the relator has served a complaint to preserve certain
non-intervened claims. Discovery regarding all claims began in
August 2001 and depositions commenced in the fall of 2002. The
government has filed a motion to consolidate the case with

United States ex rel. Schilling v. Columbia/HCA,

which
the Company has opposed. This matter is included in the proposed
settlement.

In December 1998, the U.S. District for the
Middle District of Florida unsealed

United States ex rel.
Schilling v. Columbia/HCA,

Civil Action
No. 96M-1264-CIV-T-23B. The case alleges violations of the
False Claims Act, also concerning cost reporting issues. On
December 30, 1998, the government intervened in this case
and on March 15, 2001 the government served an amended
complaint on the Company. Certain claims alleging home health
issues have been dismissed as being covered by the Civil
Agreement. The Company filed an answer and counterclaim in
response to the complaint. The counterclaim seeks payment which
includes, but is not limited to, certain amounts owed to the
Company, with interest, for outstanding cost reports not settled
by the government dating back to cost report years ended in 1994
and thereafter. The government has filed a motion to dismiss the
counterclaim. In addition, the relator has served a complaint to
preserve certain non-intervened claims. Discovery regarding all
claims began in August 2001 and depositions commenced in the
fall of 2002. The government has filed a motion to consolidate
the case with

United States ex rel. Alderson v.
Columbia/HCA,

which the Company has opposed. This matter is
included in the proposed settlement.

In December 1997,

United States ex rel.
Michael R. Marine v. Columbia Aventura Medical Center, et
al.

, Case No. 97-4368 (S.D. Fla.) was filed in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida. In general, the case alleges that the Company engaged
in improper cost shifting between facilities to improperly
maximize reimbursement and then filing false claims on its cost
reports. The government intervened on February 11, 2000. On
March 15, 2001, the government withdrew its intervention on
certain claims and served the complaint on the Company. The
Company filed an answer to the complaint on May 14, 2001.
The relator has served a complaint to preserve its
non-intervened counts, and the Company filed an answer on
June 15, 2001. The Company also moved to dismiss the
relator’s claims. On February 6, 2003, the
non-intervened claims were dismissed; however, the relator has
moved to reconsider the dismissal. This matter is included in
the proposed settlement regarding the intervened claims.

2. Physician
Referral Cases

The matter of

United States ex rel. James
Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

, Civ.
Action No. C-95-110 was filed on March 10, 1995 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas.
The relator alleges that the Company engaged in improper
financial arrangements with physicians to induce referrals. The
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended
complaint in November 1995, which was granted by the court in
July 1996. In August 1996, the relator appealed to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and in October
1997, the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated and
remanded in part the trial court’s rulings. The defendants
filed a second amended motion to dismiss, which was denied on
August 18, 1998. On August 21, 1998, relator filed a
third amended complaint. Effective February 16, 2001, the
government intervened in this case and, on March 15, 2001,
served its



amended complaint on the Company. The Company
filed an answer to the complaint on May 14, 2001, and an
amended answer on July 27, 2001. This matter has been
consolidated with

United States ex rel. King v. Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corp., et al.

and

United States ex rel. Mroz
v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

for purposes of
discovery and pretrial matters. This matter is included in the
proposed settlement.

In 1996, the case

United States ex rel. King
v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

, Civ. Action
No. EP-96-CA-342 (W.D. Tex.) was filed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of Texas. In general,
the case alleges that the Company engaged in improper financial
relationships with physicians to induce referrals in violation
of the Anti-kickback Statute as well as other alleged improper
cost reporting practices in violation of the False Claims Act,
including improper billing, laboratory fraud, falsification of
records, upcoding, and lack of certification to perform specific
services. On March 15, 2001, the government intervened in
part and declined to intervene as to the billing fraud charges.
The government’s complaint alleges that the Company’s
financial relationships with certain physicians violated the
False Claims Act, Anti-kickback Statute, and Stark Law. The
government’s complaint also asserts common law claims based
on the same allegations. The Company filed an answer to the
government’s complaint on May 14, 2001, and an amended
answer on July 27, 2001. The relator has withdrawn the
non-intervened counts. This matter has been consolidated with

United States ex rel. Thompson v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp., et al.

and

United States ex rel. Mroz v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

for purposes of
discovery and pretrial matters. This matter is included in the
proposed settlement.

On September 2, 1997, the case

United
States ex rel. Ann Mroz v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.

,
Civ. Action No. 97-2828 (S.D. Fla.) was filed in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. This
case alleges that a Company’s hospital engaged in improper
arrangements with physicians to induce referrals in violation of
the Anti-kickback Statute. The government intervened in this
case, and on March 15, 2001 served its complaint on the
Company. The government’s complaint alleges that the
Company’s financial relationships with certain physicians
violated the False Claims Act, Anti-kickback Statute, and Stark
Law. The government’s complaint also asserts common law
claims based on the same allegations. The Company filed an
answer to the government’s complaint on May 14, 2001,
and an amended answer on July 27, 2001. This matter has
been consolidated with

United States ex rel. Thompson v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

and

United States
ex rel. King v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

for
purposes of discovery and pretrial matters. This matter is
included in the proposed settlement.

3. Curative
Health Services Cases

In June of 1998, the case

United States of
America ex rel. Joseph “Mickey” Parslow v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation and Curative Health
Services, Incorporated,

No. 98-1260-CIV-T-23F was
filed, in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division. The
court unsealed the relator’s complaint on April 9,
1999. The government has intervened in this lawsuit and served
its own complaint on the Company on March 15, 2001. Relator
subsequently dismissed from his complaint all causes of action
not alleged in the government’s complaint. This

qui tam

action alleges that the Company submitted false claims
relating to contracts with Curative Health Services,
Incorporated (“Curative”) for the management of
certain wound care centers. The complaint further alleges that
the claims for reimbursement of management fees paid to Curative
violated the Anti-kickback Statute. The Company filed an answer
to the complaint on May 14, 2001. On October 25, 2001,
the relator filed a motion to use certain documents that the
Company maintains are subject to the attorney-client privilege
and/or the attorney work product protection in the prosecution
of his case. This issue has been fully briefed by the relator
and the Company, and the government filed a Statement of
Interest on the issue. This matter is included in the proposed
settlement.

The case

United States ex rel. Lanni v.
Curative Health Services, et al.,

98 Civ. 2501 (S.D. N.Y.)
was filed on April 8, 1998 in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint has
allegations similar to those in the

Parslow

case (above).
The government has intervened in the case, in part, in order to
seek dismissal of any outpatient laboratory claims covered by
the Civil Agreement and has dismissed those allegations. On
March 15, 2001, the government intervened in certain claims
relating to the request for reimbursement for non-allowable
costs and served its complaint on the Company. The relator



dismissed the remaining claims. The Company filed
an answer to the complaint on May 14, 2001, and an amended
answer on July 27, 2001. This matter is included in the
proposed settlement.

B. Qui Tam Actions in Which the United
States Has Not Intervened

In 1997, the case

United States ex rel. Adams
v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.,

of

United States ex rel. Tonya M. Atchison v. Col/HCA
Healthcare, Inc., El Paso Healthcare System, Ltd. Columbia
Wes

t

Radiology Group, P.A. West Texas Radiology Group,
Rio Grande Physicians’ Services Inc., El Paso Nurses
Unlimited Inc., El Paso Healthcare Systems Limited, and El Paso
Healthcare Systems United Partnership,

No. EP 97-CA234,

window rule, cost reports and central business office billings,
wrote off bad debt on international patients, inflated financial
information on the sale of a hospital, improperly billed
pharmacy charges and radiology charges, improperly billed
skilled nursing facility charges, improperly accounted for
discounts and rebates, improperly billed certified first
assistants in surgery, home health visits, senior health
centers, diabetic treatment and wound care centers. In 1997, the
relator also filed a second suit,

United States ex rel.
Atchison v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare, Inc.

, Civ. Action
No. 3-97-0571 (M.D. Tenn.) in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee alleging the same
violations. The relator served both complaints in March 2001. On
June 5, 2001, the Company filed a motion to extend the time
for responding to the duplicative complaints until such time as
relator elects which complaint she intends to pursue. On
December 20, 2002, the court granted the Company’s
motion and ordered the relator to dismiss the Texas action. The
relator filed an amended complaint in the Tennessee action. The
Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint on March 14,

In 1998, the case

United States ex rel.
Barrett and Goodwin v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et
al.

Texas. In general, the complaint alleges that the Company
engaged in improper financial arrangements with physicians to
induce referrals in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute as
well as improper upcoding of DRG codes. The relators served the
complaint, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss. The United
States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the
False Claims Act causes of action with leave to amend, but
denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the relator’s
retaliatory discharge claims.

In 1999, the case

United States ex rel.
Hampton v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et al.

, Civ.
Action No. 5:99-CV-59-2 (M.D. Ga.) was filed in the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia. In
general, the case alleges improper billing and improper
practices with regard to home health agencies. The relator
served the complaint, which the court dismissed on July 6, 2001.
The relator filed a notice of appeal in August 2001. On

the D.C. Circuit upheld the dismissal.

In 1997, the case

United States ex rel.
Hockett, Thompson & Staley v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.,
et al.,

Civ. Action No. 97-MC-29-A (W.D. Va.) was filed
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Virginia. In general, the case alleges that the Company filed
false claims in connection with the filing of its cost reports
such as including improper inflation of cost basis, costs
relating to unnecessary care to patients, and falsification of
records. The Company has been served with the complaint, which
it answered. Another defendant filed a motion to dismiss which
was denied on February 14, 2003. The case is now entering
the discovery phase.

In 1999, the case

United States ex rel.
McCready v. Columbia North Monroe Hospital,

Civil Action
No. 99-1099M was filed in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Louisiana. In general,



the case alleges that a Company hospital failed
to timely transfer patients to the rehabilitation unit, a
practice that allegedly resulted in improper cost allocation to
the hospital’s acute care services and thus improperly
increased reimbursement. The Company was served with the
complaint and filed an answer. Another defendant filed a motion
to dismiss which was denied. The case is now entering the
discovery phase.

On July 31, 1998, the U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Texas unsealed

United States of
America ex rel. Sara Ortega v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., et
al.

No. EP 95-CA-259H. The case had been pending under
seal since 1995, and is a

qui tam

action alleging various
violations of the Federal False Claims Act concerning statements
made to the Joint Commission in order to be eligible for
Medicare payments, thereby allegedly rendering false the
defendants’ claims for Medicare reimbursement. In 1997, the
relator filed an amended complaint alleging other issues,
including DRG upcoding, physician referral violations and
certain cost reporting issues. Some of the claims were dismissed
as released under the Settlement Agreement. The Company filed a
motion to dismiss the remaining allegations in the complaint. On
January 15, 2003, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia granted the Company’s motion.

The matter of

United States of America, ex
rel. Scott Pogue v. Diabetes Treatment Centers of America, Inc.,
et al.

, Civil Action No. 3-94-0515, was filed under
seal on June 23, 1994 in the United States District Court
for the Middle District of Tennessee. On February 6, 1995,
the United States filed its Notice of Non-Intervention and on
that same date the District Court ordered the complaint
unsealed. In general, the relator contends that sums paid to
physicians by the Diabetes Treatment Centers of America, who
served as medical directors at a hospital affiliated with the
Company, were unlawful payments for the referrals of their
patients. The relator filed a motion for partial summary
judgment. The court ordered the relator’s motion for
partial summary judgment stricken. The relator did not file an
amended motion for summary judgment. This matter is included in
the proposed settlement.

Shareholder Derivative and Class Action
    Complaints Filed in the U.S. District Courts

During the April 1997 to October 1997 period,
numerous securities class action and derivative lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Tennessee against the Company and a number of its
current and former directors, officers and/or employees.

In August 1997, the court entered an order
consolidating the above-mentioned securities class action claims
into a single-captioned case,

Morse, Sidney, et al. v. R.
Clayton McWhorter, et al.

, Case No. 3-97-0370. The
court administratively closed all of the other individual
securities class action lawsuits. The consolidated

Morse

lawsuit is a purported class action seeking the
certification of a class of persons or entities who acquired the
Company’s common stock from April 9, 1994 to
September 9, 1997. The consolidated lawsuit was brought
against the Company, Richard Scott, David Vandewater, Thomas
Frist, Jr., R. Clayton McWhorter, Carl E. Reichardt, Magdalena
Averhoff, M.D., T. Michael Long and Donald S. MacNaughton. The
lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the defendants
committed violations of the Federal securities laws by
materially inflating the Company’s revenues and earnings
through a number of practices, including upcoding, maintaining
reserve cost reports, disseminating false and misleading
statements, cost shifting, illegal reimbursements, improper
billing, unbundling and violating various Medicare laws. The
lawsuit seeks damages, costs and expenses.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the

Morse

lawsuit. On July 28, 2000, the District Court
entered an order granting the defendants’ motions to
dismiss in

Morse

. The District Court’s order
dismissed

Morse

with prejudice. In August 2000,
plaintiffs filed a motion to alter or amend judgment and for
leave to file an amended complaint and requested oral argument
on their motion. The plaintiffs’ motion to alter or amend
was denied in October 2000. In October 2000, plaintiffs filed
their Notice of Appeal. That appeal was heard before the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2002. The Sixth Circuit
reversed and remanded the case to district court. Plaintiffs
filed a fourth amended complaint, and defendants have moved to
dismiss.

The Company intends to pursue the defense of the
shareholder class action complaints vigorously.

In August 1997, the court entered an order
consolidating the above-mentioned derivative law claims into a
single-captioned case,

Carl H. McCall as Comptroller of the
State of New York and as Trustee of the New



York State Common Retirement Fund,
derivatively on behalf of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation v.
Richard L. Scott, et al.

,
No. 3-97-0838. The court administratively closed all of the
other derivative lawsuits. The consolidated

McCall

lawsuit was brought against the Company, Thomas Frist, Jr.,
Richard L. Scott, David T. Vandewater, R. Clayton McWhorter,
Magdalena Averhoff, M.D., Frank S. Royal, M.D., T. Michael Long,
William T. Young and Donald S. MacNaughton. The lawsuit alleges,
among other things, derivative claims against the individual
defendants that they intentionally or negligently breached their
fiduciary duties to the Company by authorizing, permitting or
failing to prevent the Company from engaging in various schemes
involving improperly increasing revenue, upcoding, improper cost
reporting, improper referrals, improper acquisition practices
and overbilling. In addition, the lawsuit asserts a derivative
claim against some of the individual defendants for breaching
their fiduciary duties by allegedly engaging in improper insider
trading. The lawsuit seeks restitution, damages, recoupment of
fines or penalties paid by the Company, restitution and
pre-judgment interest against the alleged insider trading
defendants, and costs and expenses. In addition, the lawsuit
seeks orders: (i) prohibiting the Company from paying
individual defendants employment benefits; (ii) terminating
all improper business relationships with individual defendants;
and (iii) requiring the Company to implement effective
corporate governance and internal control mechanisms designed to
monitor compliance with Federal and state laws and ensure
reports to the Board of material violations.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the

McCall

lawsuit. In September 1999, the District Court
entered an order granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss

McCall

with prejudice. The plaintiffs in the

McCall

lawsuit filed an appeal from that order. In February 2001,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered
an order reversing, in part, the district court’s dismissal
order and remanding the case to the trial court. In April 2001,
the Sixth Circuit denied defendants’ motion for rehearing,
or certification to the Delaware Supreme Court. In July 2001,
the trial court issued a second case management order. The
parties have reached a settlement in principle that was approved
by the HCA Board of Directors on January 30, 2003. The
settlement was presented to the court on February 27, 2003
and received preliminary approval. Following a notice period,
final court approval will be requested on June 3, 2003. The

McCall

settlement is conditioned on the dismissal of the
other derivative claims, and HCA intends to seek their dismissal
either voluntarily or by court order.

Shareholder Derivative Actions Filed in State
    Courts

Several derivative actions have been filed in
state courts by certain purported stockholders of the Company
against certain of the Company’s current and former
officers and directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty, and
failure to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Company did
not engage in illegal practices thereby exposing the Company to
significant damages.

Two purported derivative actions entitled

Barron, Evelyn, et al. v. Magdelena Averhoff, et al.

,
(Civil Action No. 15822NC), filed on July 22, 1997,
and

Kovalchick, John E. v. Magdelena Averhoff, et al.

,
(Civil Action No. 15829NC), filed on July 29, 1997, have
been filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
and for New Castle County. In addition, a purported derivative
action entitled

Williams v. Averhoff,

(Civil Action
No. 15055-NC) was filed on August 5, 1997, in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle
County, but has not been served on any defendants. The actions
were brought on behalf of the Company by certain purported
shareholders of the Company against certain of the
Company’s current and former officers and directors. The
suits seek damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. In the

Barron

lawsuits, plaintiffs also seek an order
(i) requiring individual defendants to return to the
Company all salaries or remunerations paid them by the Company,
together with proceeds of the sale of the Company’s stock
made in breach of their fiduciary duties; (ii) prohibiting
the Company from paying any individual defendant any benefits
pursuant to the terms of employment, consulting or partnership
agreements; and (iii) terminating all improper business
relationships between the Company and any individual defendant.
On March 30, 1999, the

Barron

case was dismissed
without prejudice. In the

Kovalchick

and

Williams

lawsuits, plaintiffs also seek an order (i) requiring
individual defendants to return to the Company all salaries or
remunerations paid to them by the Company and all proceeds from
the sale of the Company’s stock made in breach of their
fiduciary duties; (ii) requiring that an impartial
Compliance Committee be appointed to meet regularly; and
(iii) requiring that the Company be prohibited from paying
any director/defendant any benefits pursuant to



terms of employment, consulting or partnership
agreements. The parties have stipulated to a temporary stay of
the

Kovalchick

and

Williams

lawsuits. On
January 31, 2002, the plaintiffs in

Kovalchick

and

Williams

advised the court that they intended to lift the
stay of proceedings in this matter and proceed with discovery.
The Company has filed motions opposing plaintiffs’ request
to lift the stays. (See

Carl H. McCall, as Comptroller
of the State of New York and as Trustee of the New York State
Common Retirement Fund, derivatively on behalf of Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corporation v. Richard L. Scott, et al.

,
above.)

On August 14, 1997, a similar purported
derivative action entitled

State Board of Administration of
Florida, the public pension fund of the State of Florida in
behalf of itself and in behalf of all other stockholders of
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation derivatively in behalf of
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation vs. Magdalena Averhoff, et
al.

, (No. 97-2729), was filed in the Circuit Court in
Davidson County, Tennessee on behalf of the Company by certain
purported shareholders of the Company against certain of the
Company’s current and former directors and officers. These
lawsuits seek damages and costs as well as orders
(i) enjoining the Company from paying benefits to
individual defendants; (ii) requiring termination of all
improper business relationships with individual defendants;
(iii) requiring the Company to provide for independent
public directors; and (iv) requiring the Company to put in
place proper mechanisms of corporate governance. The court has
entered an order temporarily staying the lawsuit. (See

Carl H. McCall, as Comptroller of the State of New York
and as Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund,
derivatively on behalf of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation v.
Richard L. Scott, et al.

The matter of

Louisiana State Employees
Retirement System, a public pension fund of the State of
Louisiana, in behalf of itself and in behalf of all other
stockholders of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation derivatively
in behalf of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation v. Magdalena
Averhoff, et al.

, another derivative action, was filed on
March 19, 1998 in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh
Judicial Circuit, Dade County, Florida, General Jurisdiction
Division (Case No. 98-6050 CA04), and the defendants
removed it to the United States District Court, Southern
District of Florida (Case No. 98-814-CIV). The suit
alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duties
resulting in damage to the Company. The lawsuit seeks damages
from the individual defendants to be paid to the Company and
attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. In addition, the
lawsuit seeks orders (i) requiring the individual
defendants to pay to the Company all benefits received by them
from the Company; (ii) enjoining the Company from paying
any benefits to individual defendants; (iii) requiring that
defendants terminate all improper business relationships with
the Company and any individual defendants; (iv) requiring
that the Company provide for appointment of a majority of
independent public directors; and (v) requiring that the
Company put in place proper mechanisms of corporate governance.
On August 10, 1998, the court transferred this case to the
United States District Court, Middle District of Tennessee (Case
No. 3:98-0846). By agreement of the parties, the case has
been administratively closed pending the outcome of the
court’s ruling on the defendants’ motions to dismiss
the

McCall

action referred to above. As a result of the
court’s September 1, 1999, order dismissing the

McCall

lawsuit, this lawsuit was also dismissed with
prejudice. The plaintiffs in this lawsuit filed an appeal from
that order. On February 13, 2001, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered an order reversing, in
part, the district court’s dismissal order and remanding
the case to the trial court, and, on April 23, 2001, the
Sixth Circuit denied defendants’ motion for rehearing, or,
in the alternative, certification to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Patient/Payer
Actions and Other Class Actions

In 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000, certain plaintiffs
brought purported class action lawsuits against the Company
and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates. On February 4,
2003, plaintiffs in each of these cases with the exception of
the

Smallwood

case discussed below, combined their claims
in a single complaint for settlement purposes in the proceeding
captioned

In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing
Practices Litigation

, Master File No. MDL 1227, pending
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee (described more fully below). Also on February 4,
2003, the District Court granted preliminary approval to a
Settlement Agreement to resolve each of the following combined
cases.



The matter of In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation Billing Practices
Litigation,

Master File No. MDL
1227, was commenced by order of the MDL Panel entered on
June 11, 1998 granting the Company’s petition to
consolidate the

Boyson

and

Operating Engineers

cases (see cases below) for pretrial purposes in the Middle
District of Tennessee pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1407.
Three other cases (see cases below) that have been consolidated
with

Boyson

and

Operating Engineers

in the MDL
proceeding are (i)

Board of Trustees of the Carpenters
& Millwrights of Houston & Vicinity Welfare Trust
Fund

, (ii)

Board of Trustees of the Texas
Ironworkers’ Health Benefit Plan

, and
(iii)

Tennessee Laborers Health and Welfare Fund

. On
September 21, 1998, the plaintiffs in five consolidated
cases filed a coordinated class action complaint, which the
Company answered on October 13, 1998. Effective
November 2, 1999, a sixth case,

The United Paperworkers
International Union, et al. v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation, et al.

, was transferred by the MDL Panel for
consolidated pretrial proceedings. On December 30, 1999,
the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to file a first
amended coordinated complaint. On March 15, 2000, the court
entered an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion. The
amended complaint did not include

Board of Trustees of the
Texas Ironworkers’ Health Benefit Plan

as a plaintiff
but added a new plaintiff,

Board of Trustees of the
Pipefitters Local 522 Hospital, Medical and Life Benefit
Fund

. The defendants have filed an answer to the amended
complaint. The plaintiffs’ complaint seeks certification of
two proposed classes including all private individuals and all
employee welfare benefit plans that have paid for health-related
goods or services provided by the Company. The complaint
alleges, among other things, that the Company has engaged in a
pattern and practice of inflating charges, concealing the true
nature of patients’ illnesses, providing unnecessary
medical care, and billing for services never rendered. The
plaintiffs seek damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, as well
as disgorgement and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs filed a
motion for class certification on July 19, 2002, seeking
certification only of the class of employee welfare benefit
plans, naming only two of the named plaintiffs (the Carpenters
& Millwrights and Tennessee Laborers plans) as class
representatives, and focusing their claims on claims for
services never rendered. The Company filed its response to the
motion for class certification on August 16, 2002. On
August 14, 2002, the United Paperworkers International
Union voluntarily withdrew from the case as a named plaintiff,
and on September 6, 2002, the Board of Trustees of the
Pipefitters Local 522 Hospital, Medical and Life Benefit Fund
also voluntarily withdrew from the case as a named plaintiff. In
addition, in an order and memorandum opinion dated
April 12, 2000, the court ordered the Company to produce
certain documents that the Company listed as subject to the
attorney-client privilege and/or the attorney work product
doctrine on privilege logs. The Company appealed the
court’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals
affirmed the district court’s decision on June 10,
2002. The Company moved for reconsideration of the decision on
June 24, 2002, and requested rehearing of the matter by the
full court. On September 9, 2002, the full Court of Appeals
denied the motion and remanded the case to the district court.
The parties reached a tentative settlement that received
preliminary court approval on February 4, 2003. Following a
notice period, final court approval will be requested on
June 4, 2003.

The matter of

Boyson, Cordula, on behalf of
herself and all others similarly situated v. Columbia/HCA
Healthcare Corporation

was filed on September 8, 1997
in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee, Nashville Division (Civil Action No. 3-97-0936).
The original complaint, which sought certification of a national
class comprised of all persons or entities who have paid for
medical services provided by the Company, alleges, among other
things, that the Company has engaged in a pattern and practice
of (i) inflating diagnosis and medical treatments of its
patients to receive larger payments from the purported class
members; (ii) providing unnecessary medical care; and
(iii) billing for services never rendered. This lawsuit
seeks injunctive relief requiring the Company to perform an
accounting to identify and disgorge medical bill overcharges. It
also seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, interest and costs. In
an order entered on June 11, 1998 by the MDL Panel, other
lawsuits against the Company were consolidated with the

Boyson

case in the Middle District of Tennessee. The
amended complaint in

Boyson

was withdrawn and superseded
by the coordinated class action complaint filed in the MDL
proceeding on September 21, 1998.

(See In re:
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing Practices
Litigation.)

The matter of

Operating Engineers Local
No. 312 Health & Welfare Fund, on behalf of itself and
as representative of a class of those similarly situated v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation

was filed on
August 6, 1997 in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, Civil Action



No. 597CV203. The original complaint alleged
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations
Act (“RICO”) based on allegations that the defendant
employed one or more schemes or artifices to defraud the
plaintiff and purported class members through fraudulent billing
for services not performed, fraudulent overcharging in excess of
correct rates and fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation.
In October 1997, the Company filed a motion to transfer
venue and to dismiss the lawsuit on jurisdiction and venue
grounds because the RICO claims are deficient. The motion to
transfer was denied on January 23, 1998. The motion to
dismiss was also denied. In February 1998, defendant filed
a petition with the MDL Panel to consolidate this case with

Boyson

for pretrial proceedings in the Middle District of
Tennessee. During the pendency of the motion to consolidate,
plaintiff amended its complaint to add allegations under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”) as well as state law claims. The amended
complaint seeks damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, as well
as disgorgement and injunctive relief. The MDL Panel granted
defendant’s motion to consolidate in June 1998, and
this action was transferred to the Middle District of Tennessee.
The amended complaint in

Operating Engineers

was
withdrawn and superseded by the coordinated class action
complaint filed in the MDL proceeding on September 21,
1998.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing
Practices Litigation.)

On April 24, 1998, two matters,

Board of
Trustees of the Carpenters & Millwrights of Houston &
Vicinity Welfare Trust Fund v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation,

Case No. 598CV157, and

Board of
Trustees of the Texas Ironworker’ Health Benefit Plan v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation,

Case No. 598CV158,
were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas. The original complaint in these suits alleged
violations of RICO only. Plaintiffs in both cases principally
alleged that in order to inflate its revenues and profits,
defendant engaged in fraudulent billing for services not
performed, fraudulent overcharging in excess of correct rates
and fraudulent concealment and misrepresentation. These suits
seek damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, as well as
disgorgement and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs subsequently
amended their complaint to add allegations under ERISA as well
as state law claims. These suits have been consolidated by the
MDL Panel with

Boyson

and transferred to the Middle
District of Tennessee for pretrial proceedings. The amended
complaints in these suits were withdrawn and superseded by the
coordinated class action complaint filed in the MDL
proceeding on September 21, 1998.

(See In re:
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing Practices
Litigation.)

The matter of

Tennessee Laborers Health and
Welfare Fund, on behalf of itself and all others similarly
situated vs. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation,

Case
No. 3-98-0437, was filed in the United States District
Court of the Middle District of Tennessee, Nashville Division,
on May 14, 1998. The lawsuit seeks certification of a
national class comprised of all employee welfare benefit plans
that have paid for medical services provided by the Company.
This case involves allegations under ERISA, as well as state law
claims that are similar to those alleged in

Boyson.

The
plaintiff, an employee welfare benefit plan, alleges that the
defendant violated the terms of the plan documents by
overbilling the plans, including but not limited to,
exaggerating the severity of illnesses, providing unnecessary
treatment, billing for services not rendered and other methods
of overbilling and further violated the terms of the plan
documents by taking plan assets in payment of such improper
bills. The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant
intentionally concealed or suppressed the true nature of its
patients’ illnesses, and the actual treatment provided to
those patients, and its improper billing. The suit seeks
injunctive relief in the form of an accounting, damages,
attorneys’ fees, interest and costs. This suit has been
consolidated by the court with

Boyson

and the other cases
transferred by the MDL Panel to the Middle District of
Tennessee. The complaint in

Tennessee Laborers

was
withdrawn and superseded with the filing of the coordinated
class action complaint in the MDL proceeding on
September 21, 1998.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation Billing Practices Litigation.)

The matter of

The United Paperworkers
International Union, et al. v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation, et al.

, was filed on September 3, 1998 in
the Circuit Court for Washington County, Tennessee, Civil Action
No. 19350. The lawsuit contains billing fraud allegations
similar to those in the

Ferguson

case (below) and
seeks certification of a national class comprised of all
self-insured employers who paid or were obligated to pay any
portion of a bill for, among other things, pharmaceuticals,
medical supplies or medical services. The suit seeks declaratory
relief, damages, interest, attorneys’ fees and other
litigation costs. In addition, the suit seeks an order
(i) requiring defendants to provide an accounting to
plaintiffs and class



members who overpaid or were obligated to
overpay, (ii) requiring defendants to disgorge all monies
illegally collected from plaintiffs and the class, and
(iii) rescinding all contracts of defendants with
plaintiffs and all class members. Following the service of this
complaint on the Company on August 20, 1999, the Company
subsequently removed this lawsuit to the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee and it was
conditionally transferred by the MDL Panel to the Middle
District of Tennessee for consolidated pretrial proceedings with

In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing Practices
Litigation

and was later formally joined in plaintiffs’
amended complaint. On August 14, 2002, plaintiffs in this
matter voluntarily withdrew from the case as a named plaintiff.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation Billing
Practices Litigation.)

The matter of

Brown, Nancy, individually and
on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Columbia/ HCA
Healthcare Corporation

was filed on November 16, 1995,
in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach
County, Florida, Case No. 95-9102 AD. The suit alleges that
Palms West Hospital charged excessive amounts for goods and
services associated with patient care and treatment, including
items such as pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, laboratory
tests, medical equipment and related medical services such as
x-rays. The suit seeks the certification of a nationwide class,
and damages for patients who have paid bills for the allegedly
unreasonable portion of the charges as well as interest,
attorneys’ fees and costs. In response to the
defendant’s amended motion to dismiss filed in January
1996, the plaintiff amended the complaint and the defendant
subsequently filed an answer and defenses in June 1996. On
October 15, 1997, Harald Jackson moved to intervene in the
lawsuit (see case below). The court denied Jackson’s motion
on December 19, 1997. To date, discovery is proceeding and
no class has been certified. There has been no activity since
April 1999.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation
Billing Practices Litigation.)

The matter of

Jackson, Harald F.,
individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v.
Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation

was initially filed as a
motion to intervene in the

Brown

matter (above) in
October 1997 in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for
Palm Beach County, Florida. The court denied Jackson’s
motion on December 19, 1997, and Jackson subsequently filed
a complaint in the same state court on December 23, 1997,
Case No. 97-011419-AI. This suit seeks certification of a
national class of persons or entities who were allegedly
overcharged for medical services by the Company through an
alleged practice of systematically and unlawfully inflating
prices, concealing its practice of inflating prices, and
engaging in, and concealing, a uniform practice of overbilling.
The proposed class is broad enough to encompass all private
payers, including individuals, insurers and health and welfare
plans. This suit seeks damages on behalf of the plaintiff and
individual members of the class as well as interest,
attorneys’ fees and costs. In January 1998, the case was
removed to the United States District Court, Southern District
of Florida, Case No. 98-CIV-8050. In February 1998, Jackson
filed an amended complaint, and the case was remanded to state
court. The Company has filed motions in response to the amended
complaint, which are pending. Jackson moved to transfer the case
to the judge handling the

Brown

case but the motion to
transfer was denied on April 8, 1999. The court entered an
order dismissing the case for lack of prosecution on
June 1, 2000. The plaintiff filed a showing of good cause
on June 28, 2000. A hearing was held on July 18, 2000,
after which the court entered an order requiring that the action
remain pending. There has been no activity in the case since
July 2000.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation
Billing Practices Litigation.)

Ferguson, Charles, on behalf of himself and
all other similarly situated v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation, et al

. was filed on
September 16, 1997 in the Circuit Court for Washington
County, Tennessee, Civil Action No. 18679. This lawsuit
seeks certification of a national class comprised of all
individuals and entities who paid or were responsible for
payment of any portion of a bill for medical care or treatment
provided by the Company and alleges, among other things, that
the Company engaged in billing fraud by excessively billing
patients for services rendered, billing patients for services
not rendered or not medically necessary, uniformly using
improper codes to report patient diagnoses, and improperly and
illegally recruiting doctors to refer patients to the
Company’s hospitals. The proposed class is broad enough to
encompass all private payers, including individuals, insurers
and health and welfare plans. The suit seeks damages, interest,
attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses. In addition, the suit
seeks an order (i) requiring defendants to provide an
accounting of plaintiffs and class members who overpaid or were
obligated to overpay; and (ii) requiring defendants to
disgorge all monies illegally collected from plaintiffs and the
class. The plaintiff filed a motion



for class certification in September 1997. No
ruling has been made on the motion. In December 1997, the
Company filed a motion for summary judgment that was denied. In
January 1998, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a
second amended class action complaint to add an additional class
representative which was granted but the court dismissed the
claims asserted by the additional plaintiff. In June 1998, the
plaintiff filed a motion for leave of court to file a third
amended class action complaint, and in October 1998, the
plaintiff filed a motion for leave of court to file a fourth
amended class action complaint. The proposed third and fourth
amended complaints seek to add new named plaintiffs to represent
the proposed class. Both seek to add additional allegations of
billing fraud, including improper billing for laboratory tests,
inducing doctors to perform unnecessary medical procedures,
improperly admitting patients from emergency rooms and
maximizing patients’ lengths of stay as inpatients in order
to increase charges, and improperly inducing doctors to refer
patients to the Company’s home health care units or
psychiatric hospitals. Both seek an additional order that the
Company’s contracts with the plaintiffs and all class
members are rescinded and that the Company must repay all monies
received from the plaintiffs and the class members. The court
has not ruled on either motion for leave to amend. Discovery is
underway in the case. The Company in September 1998 filed
another motion for summary judgment contesting the standing of
the named plaintiffs to bring the alleged claims. The court has
not ruled on that motion. Amended motions for summary judgment
were filed in January 2000. The court has not yet ruled on those
motions.

The matter of

Hoop, Kemp, et al. v.
Columbia/HCA Health Corporation, et al

. was filed on
August 18, 1997 in the District Court of Johnson County,
Texas, Civil Action No. 249-171-97. This suit seeks
certification of a Texas class comprised of persons who paid for
any portion of an improper or fraudulent bill for medical
services rendered by any Texas facility owned or operated by the
Company. The suit seeks damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and
expenses, as well as restitution to plaintiffs and the class in
the amount by which defendants have been unjustly enriched and
equitable and injunctive relief. The lawsuit principally alleges
that the Company perpetrated a fraudulent scheme that consisted
of systematic and routine overbilling through false and
inaccurate bills, including padding, billing for services never
provided, and exaggerating the seriousness of patients’
illnesses. The lawsuit also alleges that the Company
systematically entered into illegal kickback schemes with
doctors for patient referrals. The Company filed its answer in
November 1997 denying the claims. Action in this case is stayed
by agreement of the parties pending the audit and status
conference in the

Columbia/HCA Billing Practices

litigation.

(See In re: Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation Billing Practices Litigation.)

Smallwood, Peggy Sue and her husband,
John R. Smallwood (formerly described as Jane Doe and her
husband, John Doe), on their own behalf, and on behalf of all
other persons similarly situated vs. HCA Health Services of
Tennessee, Inc. d/b/a HCA Donelson Hospital n/k/a Summit Medical
Center

is a class action suit filed on
August 17, 1992 in the First Circuit Court for Davidson
County, Tennessee, Case No. 92C-2041. The suit principally
alleges that Summit Medical Center’s (“Summit”)
charges for hospital services and supplies for medical services
(a hysterectomy in the plaintiff’s case) exceeded the
reasonable costs of its goods and services, that the overcharges
constitute a breach of contract and an unfair or deceptive trade
practice as well as a breach of the duty of good faith and fair
dealing. This suit seeks damages, costs and attorneys’
fees. In addition, the suit seeks a declaratory judgment
recognizing the plaintiffs’ rights to be free from
predatory billing and collection practices and an order
(i) requiring the defendants to notify plaintiff class
members of entry of declaratory judgment and (ii) enjoining
the defendants from further efforts to collect charges from the
plaintiffs. In 1997, this case was certified as a class action
consisting of all past, present and future patients at Summit
seeking declaratory relief under Rule 23.02(2) of the
Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure on the validity of the price
term in the contract. On May 24, 2001, the Tennessee
Supreme Court ruled that the hospital’s admissions contract
did not supply a definite price term as required by Tennessee
contract law. However, the court held that under quasi-contract
principles, the hospital is entitled to recover the reasonable
value of medical goods and services provided to patients.
Plaintiff amended its complaint to allege that the collection of
money for services and treatment at Summit from class members
has resulted in the unjust enrichment of the hospital since the
hospital had collected or had claims in excess of the alleged
reasonable value of its services. The plaintiffs then filed on
February 11, 2002, a motion for class certification as a
damages class with notice and opt-out rights under
Rule 23.2(3) of the Tennessee Rules of



Civil Procedure. On October 26, 2002, the
court entered an order denying the plaintiff’s motion for
class certification, and extending relief to include
attorneys’ fees and costs to plaintiff’s counsel.

While it is premature to predict the final
outcome of the

possible that an adverse resolution, individually or in the
aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on the
Company’s liquidity, financial position and results of

General
Liability and Other Claims

The matter of

Rocky Mountain Medical Center,
Inc. v. Northern Utah Healthcare Corporation, d/b/a St.
Mark’s Hospital,

Case No. 000906627, was filed in
the 3rd Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, Utah on
August 22, 2000 with a request for injunctive relief and
damages under Utah antitrust law. Specific counts in the
complaint include illegal boycott, unreasonable restraint of
trade, attempt to monopolize and interference with prospective
economic relations. At issue are St. Mark’s Hospital’s
contracts with certain managed care organizations. The court
denied the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary
injunction. Both parties filed cross-motions for summary
judgment and both motions were denied in December 2001.
Discovery is ongoing.

Two law firms representing groups of health
insurers have approached the Company and alleged that the
Company’s affiliates may have overcharged or otherwise
improperly billed the health insurers for various types of
medical care during the time frame from 1994 through 1997. The
Company is engaged in discussions with these insurers, but no
litigation has been filed. The Company is unable to determine if
litigation will be filed, and if filed, what damages would be
asserted.

The Company intends to pursue the defense of
these actions and prosecution of its counterclaims and
third-party claims vigorously.

The Company is a party to certain proceedings
relating to claims for income taxes and related interest in the
United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal
Claims and the Sixth Circuit. For a description of those
proceedings, see Note 6 — Income Taxes in
the notes to consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to claims and suits
arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for
personal injuries or for wrongful restriction of, or
interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain
of these actions the claimants have asked for punitive damages
against the Company, which may not be covered by insurance. In
the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these
pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
financial position.

PART II

Item 5.

Market
for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder
Matters

HCA’s common stock is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. (the “NYSE”) (symbol
“HCA”). The table below sets forth, for the calendar
quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices per share
reported on the NYSE composite tape for HCA’s common stock.

At the close of business on February 28,
2003, there were approximately 14,700 holders of record of
HCA’s common stock and one holder of record of HCA’s
nonvoting common stock.

HCA currently pays a regular quarterly dividend
of $0.02 per share. While it is the present intention of
HCA’s board of directors to continue paying a quarterly
dividend of $0.02 per share, the declaration and payment of
future dividends by HCA will depend upon many factors, including
HCA’s earnings, financial position, business needs, capital
and surplus and regulatory considerations.

As a consequence, current plans, anticipated actions and future
financial position and results may differ from those expressed
in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of HCA.
You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking
statements when evaluating the information presented in this
report.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims

HCA continues to be the subject of governmental
investigations and litigation relating to its business
practices. Additionally, HCA is a defendant in several

qui
tam

actions brought by private parties on behalf of the
United States of America.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims (Continued)

In December 2000, HCA entered into a Plea
Agreement with the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice and various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (the “Plea
Agreement”) and a Civil and Administrative Settlement
Agreement with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice
(the “Civil Agreement”). The agreements resolved all
Federal criminal issues outstanding against HCA and certain
issues involving Federal civil claims by, or on behalf of, the
government against HCA relating to DRG coding, outpatient
laboratory billing and home health issues. The civil issues that
were not covered by the Civil Agreement include claims related
to cost reports and physician relations issues. The Civil
Agreement was approved by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia in August 2001. HCA paid the government
$840 million (plus $60 million of accrued interest),
as provided by the Civil Agreement and Plea Agreement, during
2001. HCA also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

On March 28, 2002, HCA announced that it had
reached an understanding with CMS to resolve all Medicare cost
report, home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA
and CMS (the “CMS Understanding”). The CMS
Understanding provides that HCA would pay CMS $250 million
with respect to these matters. The CMS Understanding was reached
as a means to resolve all outstanding appeals and more than
2,600 HCA cost reports for cost report periods ended on or
before July 31, 2001, many of which CMS has yet to audit.
The CMS Understanding is subject to approval by the Department
of Justice (“DOJ”), which has not yet been obtained,
and execution of a definitive written agreement.

The understanding with CMS resulted in HCA
recording a pretax charge of $260 million
($165 million after-tax), or $0.32 per basic and $0.30 per
diluted share, consisting of the accrual of $250 million
for the settlement payment and the write-off of $10 million
of net Medicare cost report receivables. This charge was
recorded in the consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

In December 2002, HCA reached an understanding
with attorneys for the Civil Division of the DOJ to recommend an
agreement whereby the United States would dismiss the various
claims it had brought related to physician relations, cost
reports and wound care issues (the “DOJ
Understanding”) in exchange for a payment of
$631 million, with interest accruing from February 3,
2003 to the payment date at a rate of 4.5%. The DOJ
Understanding would result in the dismissal of several

qui
tam

actions brought by private parties. The DOJ
Understanding is subject to court approval, and any of the
private parties who brought forth the actions could object to
the DOJ Understanding and have those objections considered by
the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia. Were the
DOJ Understanding to be approved, it would effectively end the
DOJ investigation of the Company that was first made public in
1997. However, the DOJ Understanding would not affect

qui tam

cases in which the government has not intervened. The CIA
previously entered into by the Company would remain in effect.
The Company also reached an agreement in principle with a
negotiating team representing states that may have similar
claims against the Company. Under this agreement, the Company
would pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid agencies to
resolve any such claims. In addition, the Company has accrued
$35 million as an estimation of its legal obligation to pay
reasonable legal fees of the private parties. As a result of
this settlement, HCA recorded a pretax charge of
$603 million ($418 million after-tax) in the fourth
quarter of 2002.

Under the Civil Agreement, HCA’s existing
Letter of Credit Agreement with the DOJ was reduced from
$1 billion to $250 million at the time of the
settlement payment. Upon the Company making the payments
provided under the DOJ Understanding, the Company would no
longer have any remaining obligation to maintain letters of
credit with the DOJ.

HCA remains the subject of a formal order of
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims (Continued)

HCA continues to cooperate in the governmental
investigations. Given the scope of the investigations and
current litigation, HCA anticipates continued investigative
activity may occur in the ongoing investigations and litigation
as well as other proceedings that may be initiated.

While management remains unable to predict the
outcome of the investigations and litigation or the initiation
of any additional investigations or litigation, if HCA was found
to be in violation of Federal or state laws relating to
Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or breach of the CIA, HCA
could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil and
criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or expenses
could have a material adverse effect on HCA’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. See
Note 2 — Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims and Note 11 — Contingencies in
the notes to consolidated financial statements, and Part I,
Item 3: Legal Proceedings.

Business Strategy

HCA’s primary objective is to provide the
communities it serves a comprehensive array of quality health
care services in the most cost-effective manner and consistent
with HCA’s ethics and compliance program, governmental
regulations and guidelines and industry standards. HCA also
seeks to enhance financial performance by increasing utilization
of its facilities and improving operating efficiencies. To
achieve these objectives, HCA pursues the following strategies:

OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Business Strategy (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of HCA’s consolidated
financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses. HCA’s management
base their estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that they believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing
basis and makes changes to the estimates and related disclosures
as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

Management believes that the following critical
accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements.

Revenues

HCA derived 79% of its 2002 patient revenues (76%
in 2001 and 75% in 2000) from Medicare, Medicaid and managed
care patients. Revenues are recorded during the period the
health care services are provided, based upon the estimated
amounts due from Medicare, Medicaid and the managed care payers.
Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the
Medicare and Medicaid programs are



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
(Continued)

Revenues     (Continued)

complex and subject to interpretation. The
estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific
basis and are recorded based on the best information available
regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable
laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually
reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and
incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent
changes in managed care contractual terms that result from
contract renegotiations and renewals. Management has invested
significant resources to refine and improve the information
system data used to make these estimates and to develop a
standardized calculation process and train employees.

Due to the complexities involved in these
estimations of revenue earned, the health care services
authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often
subject to interpretations that could result in payments that
are different from our estimates.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from
Medicare, managed care payers, other third-party payers and
patients is HCA’s primary source of cash and is critical to
the Company’s operating performance. The primary collection
risks relate to uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts
for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts
covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility
amounts (deductibles and co-payments) remain outstanding.
Because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts related to
patients that meet the Company’s guidelines to qualify as
charity care, they are not reported in revenues and do not have
an impact on the provision for doubtful accounts. The revenues
associated with uninsured patients that do not meet the
Company’s current guidelines to qualify as charity care are
generally reported in revenues at gross charges. Implementation
of the Company’s plans to adjust the threshold for
determining when patients qualify as charity care, and to begin
recording revenues associated with uninsured patients at amounts
less than HCA’s established gross charges, would result in
reductions to both revenues and the provision for doubtful
accounts. The Company’s implementation of the planned
policies is conditioned on receiving a favorable ruling from CMS
that the planned policies would not adversely affect the
Company’s payments from the Medicare program.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts
is based upon management’s assessment of historical and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental health care coverage
and other collection indicators. Management relies on annual
detailed reviews of historical collections and write-offs at
facilities that represent a majority of HCA’s revenues and
accounts receivable. Adverse changes in business office
operations, payer mix, economic conditions or trends in Federal
and state governmental health care coverage could affect
HCA’s collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and
results of operations.

Investments of Insurance
    Subsidiary – Other-than-temporary Impairment
    Considerations

Continued negative trends in the debt and equity
investment markets have brought about an increased emphasis on
the disclosure of, and accounting recognition for,
other-than-temporary impairments of investment securities.
HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary holds debt and
equity security investments having an aggregate fair value of
$1.655 billion at December 31, 2002. The fair value of
the investment securities is generally based on quoted market
prices. The investment securities are held for the purpose of
providing the funding source to pay professional and general
liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiary.
Management’s assessment each quarter of whether a decline
in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary involves
multiple judgment calls, often involves estimating the outcome
of future events, and

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
(Continued)

Investments of
Insurance Subsidiary – Other-than-temporary Impairment
Considerations     (Continued)

requires a significant level of professional
judgment in determining whether factors exist that indicate an
impairment has occurred. HCA evaluates, among other things, the
financial position and near term prospects of the issuer,
conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the
investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future
cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the
issuer by a rating agency to determine if and when a decline in
the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is
considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment
to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s
fair value are important components of management’s
investment securities evaluation process. During the third
quarter of 2002, HCA recognized a $168 million
other-than-temporary impairment charge related, primarily, to
the insurance subsidiary’s equity investment securities. At
December 31, 2002, the investment security portfolio had
unrealized gains of $83 million and unrealized losses of
$16 million.

Professional Liability Insurance
    Claims

HCA, along with virtually all health care
providers, operate in an environment with medical malpractice
and professional liability risks. A substantial portion of
HCA’s professional liability risks is insured through a
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves for professional
liability risks were $1.551 billion and $1.520 billion
at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001,
respectively. Obligations covered by reinsurance contracts
remain on the balance sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to
the extent that reinsurers do not meet their obligations.
Reserves for professional liability risks (net of $265 million
and $313 million receivable under reinsurance contracts at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively) were $1.286
billion and $1.207 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Reserves and provisions for professional liability
risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The
independent actuaries estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts
receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.022 billion to
$1.361 billion at December 31, 2002 and $960 million to
$1.322 billion at December 31, 2001. Reserves for
professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate
cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the
respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves are
estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial
analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends
in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are continually
reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or
new information becomes known.

The aggregate liability covers approximately
4,400 individual claims at both December 31, 2002 and 2001
and estimates for potential unreported claims. The time period
required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the
jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The
estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary
significantly. Changes to the estimated reserve amounts are
included in current operating results. Due to the considerable
variability that is inherent in such estimates, there can be no
assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed
management’s estimates.

Accrual of Government Claims Settlements and
    Related Litigation Contingencies

HCA continues to be the subject of governmental
investigations and litigation relating to its business
practices. The governmental investigations were initiated more
than five years ago and include activities for certain entities
for periods prior to their acquisition by the Company and
activities for certain entities that have been divested.

During December 2000, HCA and the government
entered into agreements that resolved all Federal criminal
issues outstanding against HCA and certain issues involving
Federal civil claims by or on behalf of the government against
the Company relating to DRG coding, outpatient laboratory
billing and home health

Contingencies (Continued)

issues. Pursuant to the agreements, HCA paid the
government $840 million (plus $60 million of accrued
interest) during 2001.

During March 2002, HCA and CMS reached an
understanding pursuant to which the Company has agreed to pay
CMS $250 million for settlement of all CMS Medicare
reimbursement and payment issues regarding all HCA cost report,
home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS
related to cost report periods ended on or before July 31,
2001. HCA recorded an accrual for the $250 million
settlement payment in the December 31, 2001 consolidated
financial statements. The CMS Understanding is subject to
approval by the DOJ, which has not yet been obtained, and
execution of a definitive written agreement.

During December 2002, the DOJ Understanding was
reached by HCA and attorneys for the Civil Division of the DOJ.
Upon anticipated court approval, the DOJ Understanding would
result in the dismissal of the various claims the DOJ had
brought against the Company related to physician relations, cost
reports and wound care issues and would effectively end the
DOJ’s investigation of the Company that was first made
public in 1997. As a result of the DOJ Understanding, the
Company recorded a pretax charge of $603 million
($418 million after-tax) in 2002. See
Note 2 — Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims in the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

The CMS Understanding and the DOJ Understanding
are both subject to approval and the execution of definitive
agreements and there are several

qui tam

cases in which
the government has not intervened that are not covered by the
DOJ Understanding. Management recognizes that the amounts that
have been accrued must continue to be reassessed as the approval
processes and execution of definitive agreements activities
continue and new information becomes available. The amounts
claimed and the amounts the Company has accrued are substantial
and the ultimate resolution of these contingencies could require
adjustments to the amounts recorded or additional liability
accruals that could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s results of operations, financial position and
liquidity.

Results of Operations

Revenue/Volume Trends

HCA’s revenues depend upon inpatient
occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs
ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of
outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment
rates for such services.

HCA’s health care facilities’ gross
charges typically do not reflect what the facilities are
actually paid. HCA’s health care facilities have entered
into agreements with third-party payers, including government
programs and managed care health plans, under which the
facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services,
predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or
discounts from gross charges. HCA’s facilities have
experienced revenue growth due to increases in same facility
volume growth, changes in patient mix and favorable pricing
trends. HCA has experienced increases in revenue per equivalent
admission over the prior period of 8.6%, 7.2% and 5.5%, in 2002,
2001, and 2000, respectively. There can be no assurances that
HCA will continue to receive these levels of increases in the
future. These increases were the result of renegotiating and
renewing certain managed care contracts on more favorable terms,
shifts of managed care admissions to more favorable plans and
improved reimbursement from the government.

Trends (Continued)

Admissions related to Medicare, Medicaid and
managed care plans and other discounted arrangements for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are set forth
below.

The approximate percentages of inpatient revenues
of the Company’s facilities related to Medicare, Medicaid
and managed care plans and other discounted arrangements for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are set forth
below.

HCA receives a significant portion of its
revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare
and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent
and substantial changes. Legislative changes have resulted in
limitations and even reductions in levels of payments to health
care providers for certain services under these government
programs. Legislation enacted in 1999 and 2000 was directed at
reducing potential future Medicare cuts that would have occurred
as a result of previously enacted legislation, however, future
legislation or other changes or interpretation of government
health programs could have an adverse effect on reimbursement
from the government.

HCA has recorded $284 million,
$240 million, and $213 million of revenues related to
Medicare operating outlier cases for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. These
amounts represent 5.1%, 4.7% and 4.5% of Medicare revenues and
1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.3% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. There can
be no assurances that HCA will continue to receive these levels
of Medicare outlier payments in future periods. Future Medicare
outlier payments may be materially, adversely affected by:
(a) the March 2003 CMS proposed rules relating to outlier
payments; (b) changes in Medicare regulations;
(c) changes to the methodology utilized by CMS to compute
outlier payments; and (d) updates of the cost-to-charges
ratios used in the computation of HCA’s outlier payments.
HCA is unable to predict whether there will be any changes to
the provisions of the proposed CMS outlier rule when it is
ultimately finalized, when the new rule will become effective or
what, if any, updates will be made to the outlier payment
provisions for the Federal fiscal year beginning October 1,
2003. However, if the proposed outlier payment provisions are
finalized as currently proposed and the Company does not
experience changes in Medicare patient acuity levels, then the
Company’s monthly revenue from outlier payments may be
reduced by up to $12 million.

Revenue/Volume
Trends (Continued)

Managed care plan provisions that are structured
to influence patients to utilize outpatient or alternative
delivery services and the ability to continue to renegotiate and
renew managed care contracts on favorable terms are expected to
present ongoing challenges. To maintain and improve its
operating margins in future periods, HCA must increase patient
volumes while controlling the cost of providing services.

Management believes that the proper response to
these challenges includes the delivery of a broad range of
quality health care services to physicians and patients, with
operating decisions being made by the local management teams and
local physicians, and a focus on reducing operating costs
through implementation of its shared services and other
initiatives.

In March 2003, HCA announced plans to change its
charitable care policies to provide financial relief to more of
its charity patients and needs based discounts to uninsured
patients who receive non-elective care at its hospitals.

The planned changes to charity care policies
would allow patients treated at an HCA hospital for non-elective
care who have income at or below 200% of the Federal poverty
level to be eligible for charity care, a standard HCA estimates
70% of its hospitals have already been using. The Federal
poverty level is established by the Federal government and is
based on income and family size. HCA would also implement a
sliding scale of discounts for uninsured patients with income
between 200% and 400% of the Federal poverty level. HCA has
submitted its plans to CMS and asked it to rule that the
financial relief offered under the program will not adversely
affect HCA’s payments from the Medicare program.
Implementation of the planned policies is conditioned on
receiving a favorable CMS ruling and will be applied to services
provided after CMS approval.

The Company estimates that, had all of these
policy changes been in effect for its year ended
December 31, 2002, pretax income and EPS would have been
reduced by approximately $25 million and $0.03 per diluted
share, respectively. Additionally, these policy changes will
result in certain amounts that had previously been reported as
bad debt expense to being recorded as revenue reductions in
future periods. The Company estimates the impact in 2002 would
have been a reduction in net revenue of approximately $325
million to $375 million, as well as a corresponding reduction to
bad debt expense of $300 million to $350 million.

The following are comparative summaries of net
income for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000
(dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

(a)

Represents the total number of patients admitted
    to HCA’s hospitals and is used by management and certain
    investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(b)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and
    certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and
    outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed by
    multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross
    inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing
    the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent
    admissions computation “equates” outpatient revenue to
    the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient
    volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and
    outpatient volume.

(c)

Same facility information excludes the operations
    of hospitals and their related facilities that were either
    acquired or divested during the current and prior year.

December 31, 2002 and 2001

Income before income taxes decreased 1.5% from
$1.477 billion for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
$1.455 billion for the year ended December 31, 2002.
The decrease was primarily due to the $603 million charge for
the settlement with the Federal government that was recorded
during the fourth quarter of 2002. The charge was the result of
an understanding reached with the Federal government during the
fourth quarter of 2002 to settle the remaining litigation
brought by the DOJ against the Company. In 2001, HCA incurred a
pretax charge of $262 million related to an understanding
with CMS that would settle cost report, home office cost
statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS. Excluding the
effects of the settlement charges taken in both 2002 and 2001,
income before income taxes increased 18.3% to
$2.058 billion in 2002 from $1.739 billion in 2001.

Revenues increased 9.9% from 2001 to 2002 due to
both volume and rate increases. Equivalent admissions increased
1.2% on a reported basis and 2.6% on a same facility basis.
Revenue per equivalent admission increased 8.6% on a reported
basis and 8.8% on a same facility basis. The revenue per
equivalent admission increases were the result of continued
efforts in renegotiating and renewing certain managed care
contracts on favorable terms, shifts from Medicare managed care
to traditional Medicare and shifts within managed care from HMO
to PPO products.

Salaries and benefits decreased, as a percentage
of revenues, to 40.3% in 2002 from 40.5% in 2001. Salaries and
benefits per equivalent admission increased 7.9% on a reported
basis and 8.3% on a same facility basis while revenue per
equivalent admission increased 8.6% on a reported basis and 8.8%
on a same facility basis.

Supply costs increased slightly as a percentage
of revenues from 15.9% in 2001 to 16.0% in 2002. The 9.1%
increase in supplies per equivalent admission (including
pharmaceutical, orthopedic and cardiac supplies) exceeded the
8.6% increase in revenue per equivalent admission.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of
contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance,
rents and leases, utilities, insurance and non-income taxes), as
a percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.9% in 2002 from 18.1%
in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in
contract services costs that were incurred in 2001 related to
the preliminary project stage activities being performed to
develop the Company’s shared services initiatives.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
of revenues, increased to 8.0% in 2002 from 7.7% in 2001. The
effect of rate increases to gross charges on a small component
of the Company’s overall business, primarily self pay and
the uninsured, has resulted in an increase in bad debts,
measured as a percentage of revenues. The revenues associated
with these patients are generally recorded at gross charges,
which are typically higher than what government programs and
managed care plans pay, and the majority of bad debts are
attributed to this payer class.

Insurance subsidiary gains and losses on sales of
investments consist of realized gains and losses on the sales of
investment securities by HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary. In 2001, HCA had gains of $63 million compared
to losses of $2 million in 2002, due to continued overall
market declines during 2002.

Equity in earnings of affiliates remained
relatively flat as a percentage of revenues at 1.0% in 2002
compared to 0.9% in 2001.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a
percentage of revenues, to 5.0% in 2002 from 5.8% in 2001. HCA
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”) on January 1, 2002. Under the
provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer

amortized but is subject to annual impairment
tests. During 2001, $76 million of goodwill amortization
was included in depreciation and amortization.

Interest expense decreased to $446 million
in 2002 from $536 million in 2001. Interest expense on
HCA’s variable rate bank debt decreased due to a general
decline in interest rates and an upgrade to HCA’s credit
rating.

During 2002, HCA recognized a pretax gain of
$6 million ($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two
consolidating hospitals. During 2001, HCA recognized a net
pretax gain of $131 million ($76 million after-tax) on
the sales of three consolidating hospitals, HCA’s interest
in two non-consolidating hospitals and a provider of specialty
managed care benefit programs.

During 2002, due to the continued overall market
decline and management’s review and evaluation of the
individual investment securities, management concluded that
certain unrealized losses on HCA’s equity investments
should be classified as “other-than-temporary” and
recorded an impairment charge on investment securities of
$168 million. See Note 5 — Impairment of
Investment Securities in the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

During 2002, management decided to delay the
development and implementation of certain financial and
procurement information system components of its ERP program to
concentrate and direct efforts to the patient accounting and
human resources information system components, resulting in a
pretax charge of $19 million. During 2001, HCA reduced the
carrying value for a non-hospital, equity method joint venture
to fair value, based upon estimates of sales value, resulting in
a pretax charge of $17 million.

During 2002 and 2001, HCA incurred
$58 million and $65 million, respectively, of
investigation related costs. In 2002, these costs included
$56 million of professional fees (legal and accounting)
related to the governmental investigations and $2 million
of other costs. In 2001, these costs included $54 million
of professional fees (legal and accounting) related to the
governmental investigations and $11 million of other costs.

HCA adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“SFAS 145”) on January 1, 2002. Under the
provisions of SFAS 145, gains and losses on extinguishments
of debt are generally classified in operating income, rather
than as extraordinary items as previously required. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, HCA recognized an extraordinary charge
on extinguishment of debt of $28 million that has been
reclassified in the consolidated income statements.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated
entities remained flat as a percentage of revenues.

The effective income tax rate was 42.7% in 2002
and 40.0% in 2001. The higher effective income tax rate in 2002
was due to the recording of a valuation allowance and in 2001,
to certain nondeductible intangible assets related to gains on
sales of facilities and impairment of long-lived assets. If the
effect of the valuation allowance, the nondeductible intangible
assets and related amortization were excluded the effective
income tax rate would have been 39% for both periods.

Years Ended
December 31, 2001 and 2000

Income before income taxes increased 186.4% from
2000 to 2001, primarily, due to the settlement with the Federal
government related to civil and criminal issues that resulted in
a pretax charge of $840 million in 2000. Also in 2000, HCA
incurred a pretax charge of $117 million for the impairment
of long-lived assets and

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

recognized pretax gains of $34 million on the
sales of facilities. During 2001, HCA incurred a pretax charge
of $262 million for the settlement with the Federal
government, $17 million for the impairment of long-lived
assets and recognized pretax gains of $131 million on the sales
of facilities. See Note 2 — Investigations and
Settlement of Certain Government Claims, Note 3 —
Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 4 —
Impairments of Long-Lived Assets in the notes to consolidated
financial statements.

Revenues increased 7.7%, though the number of
hospitals was reduced from 187 hospitals at December 31,
2000 to 178 hospitals at the end of 2001. On a same facility
basis, revenues increased 10.2% and admissions increased 2.7%.
The increases in reported and same facility revenues were the
result of admissions growth of 0.7% on a reported basis and 2.7%
on a same facility basis, combined with revenue per equivalent
admission increases of 7.2% on a reported basis and 7.4% on a
same facility basis. Successes achieved during 2001 in
renegotiating and renewing certain managed care contracts on
favorable terms, shifts from Medicare managed care to
traditional Medicare and shifts by managed care patients from
HMO to PPO products led to these improvements in revenue per
equivalent admission.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of
revenues, increased to 40.5% in 2001 from 39.8% in 2000.
Salaries per equivalent admission increased 9.2% from 2000 to
2001 due to cost pressures associated with the tight labor
market for health care professionals and increasing employee
health benefits costs. Employee benefits as a percentage of
salaries and benefits increased from 14.9% in 2000 to 16.2% in
2001.

Supply costs increased, as a percentage of
revenues, to 15.9% in 2001 from 15.8% in 2000. The 7.8% rate of
increase in the cost of supplies per equivalent admission
(including pharmaceutical, orthopedic and cardiac supplies)
exceeded the 7.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of
contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance,
rents and leases, utilities, insurance and non-income taxes), as
a percentage of revenues, decreased to 18.1% in 2001 from 19.3%
in 2000 primarily due to the combined effect of revenue growth
and leveraging the fixed nature of the majority of these
expenses.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
of revenues, increased to 7.7% in 2001 from 7.5% in 2000. The
effect of rate increases to gross charges on a small component
of the Company’s overall business, primarily self pay and
the uninsured, has resulted in an increase in bad debts, as
measured as a percent of revenues, because the revenues
associated with those patients are generally recorded at gross
charges, which are typically higher than what government
programs and managed care plans pay.

Insurance subsidiary gains on sales of
investments consist of realized gains on the sales of investment
securities by HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.
These gains decreased from $123 million in 2000 to
$63 million in 2001. During 2000, certain funds were
reallocated among investment managers, resulting in the
recognition of previously unrealized gains.

Equity in earnings of affiliates, as a percentage
of revenues, increased to 0.9% in 2001 from 0.8% in 2000 due to
improved operations at hospital joint ventures accounted for
using the equity method.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a
percentage of revenues, to 5.7% in 2001 from 6.2% in 2000.
Depreciation and amortization levels remained relatively
unchanged while revenues increased over the prior year.

Interest expense decreased to $536 million
in 2001 from $559 million in 2000 primarily due to a
decrease in the general level of interest rates during 2001
compared to 2000.

December 31, 2001 and 2000 (Continued)

During 2001, HCA recognized a net pretax gain of
$131 million ($76 million after-tax) on the sales of
three consolidating hospitals, HCA’s interest in two
non-consolidating hospitals and a provider of specialty managed
care benefit programs. During 2000, HCA recognized a net pretax
gain of $34 million ($16 million after-tax) on the sales of
three consolidating hospitals. Proceeds from the sales were used
to repay bank borrowings.

During 2001, HCA reduced the carrying value for
its interest in a non-hospital, equity method joint venture to
fair value, based upon estimates of sales value, resulting in a
pretax charge of $17 million ($10 million after-tax).
During 2000, HCA identified and initiated plans to sell or
replace four consolidating hospitals and certain other assets.
The carrying value for the hospitals and other assets to be
divested was reduced to fair value based upon estimates of sales
values, resulting in a pretax charge of $117 million
($80 million after-tax). See Note 4 —
Impairments of Long-Lived Assets in the notes to consolidated
financial statements.

During 2001 and 2000, respectively, HCA incurred
$65 million and $62 million of investigation related costs.
In 2001, these costs included $54 million of professional fees
(legal and accounting) related to the governmental
investigations and $11 million of other costs. In 2000,
these costs included $51 million of professional fees
(legal and accounting) related to the governmental
investigations and $11 million of other costs.

HCA adopted SFAS 145 on January 1,
2002. Under the provisions of SFAS 145 gains and losses on
extinguishments of debt are generally classified in operating
income, rather than as extraordinary items as previously
required. During the fourth quarter of 2001, HCA recognized an
extraordinary charge on extinguishment of debt of
$28 million that is now classified in operating income as
loss on retirement of debt.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated
entities increased, as a percentage of revenues, to 0.7% in 2001
from 0.5% in 2000 due to improved operations at certain
consolidating joint ventures.

The effective income tax rate was 57.6% in 2000
and 40.0% in 2001. The higher effective income tax rate in 2000
was due to the recording of a valuation allowance and certain
nondeductible intangible assets related to gains on sales of
facilities and impairment of long-lived assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$2.750 billion in 2002, compared to $1.413 billion in
2001 and $1.547 billion in 2000. The increase in cash
provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 and the
decrease during 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the
payment of $840 million to the Federal government in 2001
pursuant to the Plea and Civil Agreements and changes in income
tax payments.

Working capital totaled $766 million at
December 31, 2002 and $957 million at
December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
current liabilities included $933 million and
$250 million, respectively, for settlements with the
Federal government.

Cash used in investing activities was
$1.740 billion, $1.300 billion and $1.087 billion
in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding acquisitions,
capital expenditures were $1.718 billion in 2002,
$1.370 billion in 2001 and $1.155 billion in 2000. HCA
expended $124 million, $239 million and $350 million
for acquisitions and investments in and advances to affiliates
(generally interests in joint ventures that are accounted for
using the equity method) during 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. Capital expenditures in all three years were
funded by a combination of cash flows from operations and the
issuance of debt. Planned capital expenditures

Liquidity and Capital Resources
(Continued)

in both 2003 and 2004 are expected to approximate
$2.0 billion. At December 31, 2002, there were
projects under construction, which had an estimated additional
cost to complete and equip over the next five years of
$2.7 billion. HCA expects to finance capital expenditures
with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2002, HCA announced the signing of a
definitive agreement for HCA to acquire the 14-hospital Health
Midwest system in Kansas City, Missouri for $1.125 billion.
HCA will also commit to make $450 million in capital
investments in the Kansas City market during the next five
years. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and
other customary conditions.

In addition to cash flows from operations,
available sources of capital include amounts available under
HCA’s $1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) ($1.4 billion and
$1.5 billion as of December 31, 2002 and February 28,
2003, respectively) and anticipated access to public and private
debt markets. Management believes that its available sources of
capital are adequate to expand, improve and equip its existing
health care facilities and to complete selective acquisitions.

Investments of HCA’s professional liability
insurance subsidiary to maintain statutory equity and pay claims
totaled $1.655 billion and $1.703 billion at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Claims payments,
net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next twelve months are
expected to approximate $300 million. HCA’s
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain
reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the
reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the
subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do
not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. To
minimize its exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, HCA
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors
concentrations of credit risk arising from similar activities or
economic characteristics of the reinsurers. The amounts
receivable related to the reinsurance contracts of $265 million
and $313 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, are included in other assets.

Cash flows used in financing activities totaled
$934 million in 2002, $342 million in 2001 and
$336 million in 2000. The increase in cash used during 2002
was related to the repayment of an investment made by a
financial institution that invested $400 million to
capitalize an entity that acquired HCA common stock. The primary
source of funds for the cash used in financing activities was
cash flow from operating activities.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock.
During 2002, HCA made open market purchases of 6.2 million
shares for $282 million. The repurchases were intended to
offset the dilutive effect of employee stock compensation
programs.

In October 2001, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock.
During 2001, HCA repurchased 6.4 million shares through
open market purchases for $250 million, completing the
repurchase authorization.

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a
financial institution that resulted in the financial institution
investing $400 million (at December 31, 2001) to
capitalize an entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This
consolidated affiliate acquired 16.8 million of HCA shares
in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain forward
purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the financial
institution and received 16.8 million shares of the
Company’s common stock. The financial institution’s
investment in the consolidated affiliate is reflected in
HCA’s balance sheet as “Company-obligated mandatorily
redeemable securities of affiliate holding solely Company
securities” at December 31, 2001. The quarterly return
on the financial institution’s investment, based on LIBOR
plus 125 basis points return rate during 2001 and LIBOR plus
87.5 basis points return rate during 2002, is recorded as
minority interest expense.

In March 2000, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to $1 billion of the Company’s common
stock. During 2001, HCA settled forward purchase contracts
representing 19.6 million shares at a

cost of $677 million. During 2000, HCA
settled forward purchase contracts representing approximately
11.7 million shares at a cost of $300 million. In
addition, during 2001, HCA purchased 1.1 million shares
through open market purchases at a cost of $40 million, and
received $17 million in premiums from the sale of put
options.

In November 1999, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. During
2000, HCA settled forward purchase contracts representing
approximately 18.7 million shares at a cost of
$539 million. During 2001, HCA settled the remaining
forward purchase contracts associated with its November 1999
authorization representing 15.7 million shares at a cost of
$461 million.

In March 2000, HCA entered into a
$1.2 billion bank term loan agreement (the “2000 Term
Loan”). Proceeds from the 2000 Term Loan were used in the
first quarter of 2000 to retire the outstanding balance under a
$1.0 billion term loan and to reduce outstanding loans
under HCA’s previously existing $2.0 billion credit
facility (“Prior Credit Facility”).

In May 2000, an English subsidiary of HCA entered
into a $168 million Term Facility Agreement (“English
Term Loan”) with a bank. The term loan was used to purchase
the ownership interest of HCA’s joint venture partner in
England and to refinance existing indebtedness.

In August 2000, HCA issued $750 million of
8.75% notes due September 1, 2010. Proceeds from the notes
were used to reduce outstanding loans under the Prior Credit
Facility by $350 million, reduce the outstanding balance
under the 2000 Term Loan by $200 million and to settle
$200 million of forward purchase contracts related to
HCA’s common stock.

In September 2000, HCA issued $500 million
of floating rate notes due September 19, 2002. Proceeds
from the notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance under
the 2000 Term Loan.

In November 2000, HCA issued approximately
$217 million of 8.75% notes due November 1, 2010.
Proceeds from the notes were used to repay the outstanding
balance under the English Term Loan and for general corporate
purposes.

In January 2001, HCA issued $500 million of
7.875% notes due 2011. Proceeds from the notes were used to
retire the outstanding balance under the 2000 Term Loan.

In April 2001, HCA entered into a
$2.5 billion credit agreement (the “2001 Credit
Agreement”) with a group of banks consisting of a
$1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) and a $750 million term loan (the
“2001 Term Loan”).

The 2001 Credit Agreement has a final maturity in
April 2006. The Credit Facility refinanced and replaced the
Prior Credit Facility. Interest under the 2001 Credit Agreement
is payable at a spread to LIBOR, a spread to the prime lending
rate or a competitive bid rate. The spread is dependent on
HCA’s credit ratings. The 2001 Credit Agreement contains
customary covenants which include (i) limitations on debt
levels, (ii) limitations on sales of assets, mergers and
changes of ownership, and (iii) maintenance of minimum
interest coverage ratios. As of February 28, 2003, HCA was
in compliance with all such covenants.

In May 2001, HCA issued $500 million of
7.125% notes due June 1, 2006. Proceeds from the notes were
used for general corporate purposes.

In February 2002, Standard & Poor’s
upgraded HCA’s senior debt rating from BB+ to BBB-.

In April 2002, HCA issued $500 million of
6.95% notes due May 1, 2012. Proceeds from the notes were
used for general corporate purposes.

In May 2002, HCA filed a shelf registration
statement and prospectus with the SEC related to up to
$1.5 billion in debt securities. Of the $1.5 billion
available, $1 billion has been issued at February 28,
2003.

In September 2002, HCA issued $500 million
of 6.30% notes due October 1, 2012. Proceeds from the notes
were issued to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit
Facility and for general corporate purposes.

In February 2003, HCA issued $500 million of
6.25% notes due February 15, 2013. Proceeds from the notes
were used for general corporate purposes.

Management believes that cash flows from
operations, amounts available under the Credit Facility and
HCA’s anticipated access to public and private debt markets
are sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next
twelve months.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

As of December 31, 2002, maturities of
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are

Market Risk

HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes
in market values of securities. The investments in debt and
equity securities of HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary were $1.170 billion and $485 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2002. These investments are
carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and
losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive
income. The fair value of investments is generally based on
quoted market prices. During the third quarter of 2002, due to
the continued overall market decline and management’s
review and evaluation of the individual investment securities,
management concluded that certain unrealized losses of
HCA’s insurance subsidiary’s equity investments were
considered

“other-than-temporary”. HCA recorded an
impairment charge on the identified investment securities of
$168 million. The declines in fair value and any resulting
losses incurred on sales of the securities on which the
impairment charge was recorded do not present a current
liquidity concern to the Company, as professional liability
claim payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next
twelve months are estimated to be approximately
$300 million and $1.655 billion of investment
securities are available. However, if the insurance subsidiary
were to continue to experience market declines in its
investments, this could require additional investment by the
Company to allow the insurance subsidiary to satisfy its minimum
capital requirements.

HCA evaluates, among other things, the financial
position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in
the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes
in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
“other-than-temporary”. The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment
to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s
fair value are important components of management’s
investment securities evaluation process. At December 31,
2002, HCA had a net unrealized gain of $67 million on the
insurance subsidiary’s investment securities.

HCA is also exposed to market risk related to
changes in interest rates, and HCA periodically enters into
interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to these
fluctuations. HCA’s interest rate swap agreements involve
the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments
between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts
and maturity dates. The notional amounts and interest payments
in these agreements match the cash flows of the related
liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis. These derivatives and the related hedged
debt amounts have been recognized in the financial statements at
their respective fair values.

With respect to HCA’s interest-bearing
liabilities, approximately $1.6 billion of long-term debt at
December 31, 2002 is subject to variable rates of interest,
while the remaining balance in long-term debt of
$5.3 billion at December 31, 2002 is subject to fixed
rates of interest. Both the general level of U.S. interest rates
and, for the 2001 Credit Agreement, the Company’s credit
rating affect HCA’s variable interest rate. HCA’s
variable rate debt is comprised of the Company’s Credit
Facility on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR plus
0.7% to 1.5% (depending on HCA’s credit ratings), a bank
term loan on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR plus
1% to 2%, and fixed rate notes on which interest rate swaps have
been employed on which interest is payable at LIBOR plus 1.9% to
2.4%. Due to decreases in LIBOR and the improvement in the
Company’s credit rating, the average rate for the
Company’s Credit Facility decreased from 4.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2001 to 2.5% for the year ended
December 31, 2002, and the average rate for the
Company’s term loans decreased from 5.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to 2.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2002. The estimated fair value of HCA’s
total long-term debt was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2002.
The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the
same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest
rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax
earnings would be approximately $16 million. The impact of
such a change in interest rates on the fair value of long-term
debt would not be significant. The estimated changes to interest
expense and the fair value of long-term debt are determined
considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on
HCA’s borrowing cost and long-term debt balances. To
mitigate the

impact of fluctuations in interest rates, HCA
generally targets a portion of its debt portfolio to be
maintained at fixed rates.

Foreign operations and the related market risks
associated with foreign currency are currently insignificant to
HCA’s results of operations and financial position.

Effects of Inflation and Changing
Prices

Various Federal, state and local laws have been
enacted that, in certain cases, limit HCA’s ability to
increase prices. Revenues for acute care hospital services
rendered to Medicare patients are established under the Federal
government’s prospective payment system. Total Medicare
revenues approximated, 28% in 2002, 2001 and in 2000 of
HCA’s total patient revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry
operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under
significant pressure because of changes in payer mix and growth
in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective
payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of
increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, HCA’s
ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to
non-Medicare patients is limited.

IRS Disputes

HCA is contesting claims for income taxes and
related interest proposed by the IRS for prior years aggregating
approximately $319 million as of December 31, 2002.
Management believes that final resolution of these disputes will
not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
or liquidity of HCA. See Note 6 — Income Taxes in
the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description
of the pending IRS disputes.

During 2001, the Company and the IRS filed
Stipulated Settlements with the Tax Court regarding the
IRS’ proposed disallowance of certain financing costs,
systems conversion costs and insurance premiums which were
deducted in calculating taxable income and the allocation of
costs among fixed assets and goodwill in connection with certain
hospitals acquired by the Company in 1995 and 1996. The
settlement resulted in the Company’s payment of additional
tax and interest of $16 million and had no impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

During 2001, the Company filed an appeal with the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit with
respect to two Tax Court decisions received in 1996 related to
the IRS examination of HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns. HCA is contesting
the Tax Court decisions related to the method that Hospital
Corporation of America used to calculate its tax reserve for
doubtful accounts and the timing of deferred income recognition
in connection with its sales of certain subsidiaries to
Healthtrust Inc. — The Hospital Company in 1987.

During 2000, HCA and the IRS filed a Stipulated
Settlement with the Tax Court regarding the IRS’ proposed
disallowance of certain acquisition-related costs, executive
compensation and systems conversion costs which were deducted in
calculating taxable income and the methods of accounting used by
certain subsidiaries for calculating taxable income related to
vendor rebates and governmental receivables. The settlement
resulted in the payment of tax and interest of $156 million
and had no impact on HCA’s results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2002 and 2001
and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2002. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31,
2002 and 2001, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, effective January 1, 2002.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Reporting Entity

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates
own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The
term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect
subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in
which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2002,
these affiliates owned and operated 173 hospitals, 74
freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient
and ancillary services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in
joint ventures that own and operate six hospitals and four
freestanding surgery centers, which are accounted for using the
equity method. The Company’s facilities are located in 22
states, England and Switzerland. The terms “HCA” or
the “Company” as used in this annual report on
Form 10-K refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless
otherwise stated or indicated by context.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The majority of the Company’s
expenses are “cost of revenue” items.

The consolidated financial statements include all
subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. “Control”
is generally defined by HCA as ownership of a majority of the
voting interest of an entity. Variable interests are considered
for investments in entities that are not controlled by voting
interests and for investments in entities in which the equity
investment is not proportional to the economic risks and
rewards. Significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities that HCA does not control,
but in which it has a substantial ownership interest and can
exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the
equity method.

HCA has completed various acquisitions and joint
venture transactions that have been recorded under the purchase
method of accounting. Accordingly, the accounts of these
entities have been consolidated with those of HCA for periods
subsequent to the acquisition of controlling interests.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service
revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates
less allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are
recorded during the period the health care services are
provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients
and third-party payers, including Federal and state agencies
(under the Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare programs), managed
care health plans, commercial insurance companies and employers.
Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Managed care agreements’
contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted
fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and
Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As
a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that
recorded estimates will change by a material amount. The
estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent
periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final
settlements are determined (in relation to certain government
programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as
the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts resulted in
increases to revenues of $76 million, $105 million and
$168 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. In
association with the ongoing Federal investigations into certain
of HCA’s business practices, the applicable governmental
agencies had substantially ceased the processing of final
settlements of HCA’s cost reports. Since the cost reports
were not being settled, HCA has not been receiving the updated
information which, prior to 1998, was the basis used by HCA to

F-7


HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Revenue
(Continued)

adjust estimated settlement amounts. Upon the
approval and execution of the March 28, 2002 understanding
reached by HCA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (“CMS”) (See Note 2 —
Investigations and Settlement of Certain Government Claims), all
Medicare cost report, home office cost statement and appeal
issues between HCA and CMS would be resolved. The Medicare cost
reports that would be resolved include more than 2,600 HCA cost
reports for cost report periods ended on or before July 31,
2001. Management believes that adequate provisions have been
made for adjustments that may result from final determination of
amounts earned under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

HCA provides care without charge to patients who
are financially unable to pay for the health care services they
receive. Because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts
determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
revenues.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.

Accounts Receivable

HCA receives payments for services rendered from
Federal and state agencies (under the Medicare, Medicaid and
Tricare programs), managed care health plans, commercial
insurance companies, employers and patients. During both years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, approximately 28% of
HCA’s revenues related to patients participating in the
Medicare program. HCA recognizes that revenues and receivables
from government agencies are significant to its operations, but
does not believe that there are significant credit risks
associated with these government agencies. HCA does not believe
that there are any other significant concentrations of revenues
from any particular payer that would subject it to any
significant credit risks in the collection of its accounts
receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts.
Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the
allowance and subsequent recoveries are added.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts
is based upon management’s assessment of historical and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental health care coverage
and other collection indicators. The primary tool used in
management’s assessment is an annual, detailed review of
historical collections and write-offs at facilities that
represent a majority of the Company’s revenues and accounts
receivable. The results of the detailed review of historical
collections and write-offs experience, adjusted for changes in
trends and conditions, are used to evaluate the allowance amount
for the current period.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment and Amortizable
    Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the
straight-line method, was $1.007 billion in 2002,
$961 million in 2001, and $931 million in 2000.
Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful
lives

Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles (Continued)

ranging generally from ten to 40 years.
Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to
ten years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the
lives of the respective debt obligations. The gross carrying
amount of deferred loan costs at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was
$91 million and $85 million, respectively, and
accumulated amortization was $24 million and
$18 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is included in
interest expense and was $11 million, $12 million and
$15 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

On January 1, 2002, HCA adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“SFAS 144”). Prior to January 1, 2002, HCA
recognized impairments of long-lived assets in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” In accordance with
SFAS 144, when events, circumstances or operating results
indicate that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets
and related identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
that are expected to be held and used, might be impaired, HCA
prepares projections of the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual
disposition. If the projections indicate that the recorded
amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are
reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated
based upon internal evaluations of each market that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities and independent appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs
to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based
upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based
upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Goodwill

HCA adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”) on January 1,
2002. Under SFAS 142, beginning in 2002, goodwill is no
longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. The
Company compares the fair value of the goodwill to the carrying
amount on at least an annual basis to determine if there is
potential impairment. If the fair value of the asset is less
than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair
value of goodwill is estimated based upon internal evaluations
of the related long-lived assets in each market that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities and market responses based
upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.
The market responses are usually considered to provide the most
reliable estimates of fair value. During 2002, goodwill
increased by $32 million related to acquisitions, decreased
by $30 million related to facilities that were sold and
increased by $8 million due to foreign currency translation
adjustments. No impairment loss was recognized during 2002
related to goodwill.

Prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill was
amortized using the straight-line method, generally over periods
ranging from 30 to 40 years for hospital acquisitions and
periods ranging from five to 20 years for physician
practice, clinic and other acquisitions.

Professional Liability Insurance
    Claims

A substantial portion of HCA’s professional
liability risks is insured through a wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary of HCA, which is funded annually. Reserves for
professional liability risks were $1.551 billion and $1.520
billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
current portion of this reserve, $358 million and
$318 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, is included in “Other accrued expenses”
in the

consolidated balance sheet. Professional
liability insurance expense of $350 million, $274 million
and $231 million for the years ended December 31,
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, is classified in “Other
operating expenses” in the Company’s consolidated
income statement. Provisions for losses related to professional
liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates.
Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate
net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through
the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves
for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using
individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those
estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity
and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and
adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new
information becomes known. The changes to the estimated reserve
amounts are included in current operating results. The aggregate
liability covers approximately 4,400 individual claims at both
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and estimates for potential
unreported claims. The time period required to resolve these
malpractice claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2002 and 2001,
$335 million and $278 million, respectively, of
payments were made for professional and general liability
claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year
can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is
inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, management
believes that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are
adequate; however, there can be no assurance that the ultimate
liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

HCA’s facilities are insured by the
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
$25 million per occurrence. Professional liability risks
above a $6.8 million retention per occurrence for 2001 and
a $10 million retention per occurrence for 2002 were reinsured
with unrelated commercial carriers. The insurance subsidiary
obtained no reinsurance for 2003. HCA also maintains
professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial
carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by its
insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by the reinsurance
contracts with the insurance subsidiary remain on the balance
sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the
reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance
contracts. The amounts receivable for the reinsurance contracts
of $265 million and $313 million at December 31, 2002,
and 2001, respectively, are included in other assets. In
addition, deferred gains from retroactive reinsurance of
$11 million and $15 million are included in other
liabilities at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively,
and will be recognized over the estimated recovery period using
the interest method.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
investments of HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
classified as “available-for-sale” as defined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” and are recorded in HCA’s consolidated
balance sheet at fair value. The investment securities are held
for the purpose of providing the funding source to pay
professional and general liability claims covered by the
insurance subsidiary. Management’s assessment of individual
investment securities each quarter as to whether declines in
market value are temporary or other-than-temporary involves
multiple judgment calls, often involves estimating the outcome
of future events, and requires a significant level of
professional judgment in determining whether factors exist that
indicate an impairment has occurred. HCA evaluates, among other
things, the financial position and near term prospects of the
issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of
the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected
future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of
the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if and when a
decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost
is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and
extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
amortized cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the
investment to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
investment’s fair value are important components of
management’s investment securities evaluation process.

Related Party Transactions

MedCap Properties, LCC
    (“MedCap”)

In December 2000, HCA transferred 116 medical
office buildings (“MOBs”) to MedCap. HCA received
approximately $250 million and a minority interest
(approximately 48%) in MedCap in the transaction. MedCap is a
private company that was formed by HCA and other investors to
acquire the buildings. HCA did not recognize a gain or loss on
the transaction. The Chief Manager of MedCap, who is also a
member of the MedCap board of governors, is a relative of a
Director and former executive officer of the Company.

HCA leases certain office space from MedCap and,
during the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, paid
MedCap $19.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively,
in rents for such leased office space. HCA reserves certain
rights of control and approval with respect to the leasing,
operation and maintenance of the MOBs transferred to MedCap. In
return for these rights, HCA has provided MedCap with a
contingent guaranty of a specified level of net operating
income, defined as rental income less operating expenses. This
agreement relates to the majority of the MOBs transferred to
MedCap and no payments were required under the agreement during
2002 or 2001. HCA has also provided special credit enhancement
under separate operations and support agreements related to
certain MOBs that are newly constructed or have relatively low
occupancy rates. HCA incurred costs of $1.9 million and
$3.2 million under these agreements during 2002 and 2001,
respectively. HCA expects that the costs to be incurred in
future periods under these agreements will not have a material
impact on its results of operations. The term for the operations
and support agreements is for five years and is extendable
indefinitely at HCA’s option.

MedCap has the option to require HCA to purchase
the affiliated MOBs with respect to an HCA hospital that is
closed or replaced. The purchase price for affiliated MOBs under
the option agreement is the greater of their aggregate current
fair value or their aggregate book value at MedCap’s
formation date. During 2002, HCA repurchased one MOB from MedCap
that was affiliated with a hospital facility that HCA planned to
sell. The aggregate purchase price of $0.4 million exceeded
HCA’s allocation of its investment book value by $0.2
million. During 2001, HCA repurchased two MOBs from MedCap that
were affiliated with a hospital facility that HCA planned to
sell. The aggregate purchase price of $4.5 million exceeded
HCA’s allocation of its investment book value for the two
MOBs by $1.9 million. MedCap has rights of first offer on
any future MOBs developed by HCA or its affiliates and on the
disposition by HCA and its affiliates of any existing MOB
associated with HCA hospitals, in geographic markets covered by
MedCap. During 2002 and 2001, HCA entered into development
and/or operating agreements with MedCap related to four new MOBs
that have an aggregate estimated cost of $65 million.

LifePoint Hospitals, Inc.
    (“LifePoint”) and Triad Hospitals, Inc.
    (“Triad”)

In May 1999, HCA completed the spin-offs of
LifePoint and Triad (the “Spin-offs”) through the
distribution of shares of LifePoint common stock and Triad
common stock to the HCA stockholders. In connection with the
Spin-offs, HCA entered into agreements to provide financial,
clinical, patient accounting and network information to
LifePoint and Triad. The agreements have terms expiring in May
2006. In addition, HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
provides insurance and risk management services, negotiated on a
year-to-year basis, to LifePoint and Triad. For the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, HCA received
$11.8 million, $11.6 million and $11.0 million,
respectively, from LifePoint and $46.5 million,
$35.6 million and $26.2 million, respectively, from
Triad pursuant to these agreements. The fees

market competitive and are based on HCA’s costs incurred in
providing the services. During 2000, HCA sold a hospital
facility to LifePoint for a sales price of $51 million and
realized a pretax gain of $18 million. During 2001, HCA
sold a hospital facility to LifePoint for a sales price of
$19 million and realized a pretax gain of $3 million. The
Company believes the sales of the hospital facilities to
LifePoint were on terms no less favorable to the Company than
those which would have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.

Global
Health Exchange, LLC (“GHX”)

In 1999, HCA formed empactHealth.com, with the
intent of improving its hospitals’ efficiencies in the
procurement of goods and supplies by utilizing the Internet. In
January 2001, empactHealth.com merged with Medibuy, an unrelated
competitor of empactHealth.com. As a result of the merger, HCA
owned approximately 17% of Medibuy and HCA’s directors and
certain members of its management owned approximately 2%. During
2001, HCA reduced the carrying value for its investment in
Medibuy to fair value, based upon estimates of sales values,
resulting in a pretax charge of $17 million
($10 million after tax). During 2002, HCA paid
$2.4 million to Medibuy for annual software license fees,
transaction fees and related services and paid and expensed
$3 million of additional investment payments to Medibuy.
During 2002, HCA’s management and directors relinquished
their ownership in Medibuy for no consideration. In December
2002, Medibuy merged with GHX. As a result of the merger, HCA
owns approximately 7% of GHX and an officer of HCA serves on
GHX’s board of directors. HCA and GHX entered into a
three-year, master user agreement, which commenced on
January 1, 2003, pursuant to which GHX provides access to
its e-commerce system, a license to certain requisitioning
software and other services. The user agreement with GHX
provides for annual payments of $3.0 million for 2003 and
$2.5 million for 2004 and 2005. Healthtrust Purchasing
Group (“HPG”), an affiliate of HCA, also entered into
an e-commerce agreement with GHX, which commenced on
January 1, 2003, pursuant to which HPG will be able to
offer the GHX e-commerce system to HPG members. The Company
believes its transactions with Medibuy and GHX are on terms no
less favorable to the Company than those which would be obtained
from unaffiliated parties.

HealthStream,
Inc. (“HealthStream”)

In October 2001, HCA entered into an amended
agreement with HealthStream to purchase internet-based education
and training services. The agreement has a four-year term and
provides for minimum fees of $2.5 million per year, with
total minimum fees of $12 million over the four-year term.
During 2002 and 2001, the Company paid HealthStream
$2.9 million and $1.5 million, which represented
approximately 18% and 11%, respectively, of HealthStream’s
net revenues. The Chief Executive Officer, President and
Chairman of the Board of Directors of HealthStream is a relative
of a Director and former executive officer of HCA. The Company
believes its transactions with HealthStream are on terms no less
favorable to the Company than those which would be obtained from
an unaffiliated party.

Stock-Based
Compensation

HCA applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”) and related
interpretations in accounting for its employee stock benefit
plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for
HCA’s stock options granted under the plans because the
exercise prices for options granted were equal to the quoted
market prices on the option grant dates and all option grants
were to employees or directors.

Stock-Based
Compensation (Continued)

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), HCA has
determined the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if
compensation cost for HCA’s employee stock option and stock
purchase plans had been determined based upon fair values at the
grant dates. These pro forma amounts are as follows (dollars in
millions, except per share amounts):

(a)

The Company determines pro forma stock-based
    employee compensation expense using an estimated forfeiture
    assumption. A forfeiture assumption of 50% had been used for
    periods through December 31, 2001. This 50% forfeiture
    assumption was reasonable for stock option grants made during
    the 1995 through 1998 period, but subsequent to the Company
    completing a major restructuring process that involved
    significant executive management turnover, the Spin-offs, and
    the sales of numerous facilities, the Company determined during
    2002 that the forfeiture assumption for 1999 and subsequent
    grants should be lowered significantly. During 2002, the Company
    revised the expected forfeiture assumption for the 1999 and 2000
    stock option grants to 15%, and a 10% forfeiture assumption is
    being used for 2001 and subsequent stock option grants. The
    effect of the changes in the estimated forfeiture assumptions
    for stock option grants made prior to 2002, was an increase to
    the pro forma stock-based employee compensation expense for the
    year ended December 31, 2002 of $64 million ($0.13 per
    basic share and $0.12 diluted share).

For SFAS 123 purposes, the weighted average
fair values of HCA’s stock options granted in 2002, 2001
and 2000 were $13.30, $15.93 and $9.33 per share, respectively.
The fair values were estimated using the Black-Scholes option
valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The expected volatility is derived using weekly
data drawn from the seven years preceding the date of grant. The
risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on four-year
United States Treasury Strips on the date of grant. The expected
life is an estimate of the number of years the option will be
held before it is exercised. The valuation model was not
adjusted for nontransferability, risk of forfeiture or the
vesting restrictions of the options, all of which would reduce
the value if factored into the calculation.

Stock-Based
Compensation (Continued)

The pro forma compensation cost related to the
shares of common stock issued under HCA’s amended and
restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $13 million,
$6 million and $14 million for the years 2002, 2001
and 2000, respectively. These pro forma costs were estimated
based on the difference between the price paid and the fair
market value of the stock on the last day of each subscription
period.

Derivatives

Effective January 1, 2001, HCA adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, as amended (“SFAS 133”).
SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives, whether designated
in hedging relationships or not, be recognized on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income
statement when the hedged item affects earnings. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 133, HCA designated its
outstanding interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges.
HCA determined that the current agreements are highly effective
in offsetting the fair value changes in a portion of HCA’s
debt portfolio. These derivatives and the related hedged debt
amounts have been recognized in the consolidated financial
statements at their respective fair values.

Recent
Pronouncements

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for
Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 143”). SFAS 143
establishes accounting standards for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated
asset retirement cost. It also provides accounting guidance for
legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. SFAS 143 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2002, with early adoption
permitted. The Company expects that the provisions of
SFAS 143 will not have a material impact on its results of
operations and financial position upon adoption. HCA plans to
adopt SFAS 143 effective January 1, 2003.

During April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“SFAS 145”). For most companies, under the
provisions of SFAS 145 gains and losses on extinguishments
of debt will generally be classified as income or loss from
continuing operations, rather than as extraordinary items as
previously required under FASB Statement No. 4.
Extraordinary item treatment will be required for certain
extinguishments that comply with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 30. Upon
adoption, any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt previously
classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods, that does
not meet the criteria of APB Opinion 30 for such
classification, should be reclassified to conform to the
provisions of SFAS 145. The provisions of SFAS 145
will be applied in fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002; however, early adoption is encouraged and HCA elected to
adopt SFAS 145 effective January 1, 2002. During the
fourth quarter of 2001, HCA recognized an extraordinary charge
on extinguishment of debt of $28 million ($17 million,
net of tax) that has been reclassified in the consolidated
income statements.

During June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires that a
liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal
activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under
previous accounting standards, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an

exit plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 will
be applied for exit or disposal activities initiated after
December 31, 2002. If HCA initiates exit or disposal
activities SFAS 146 could have a material effect on the
timing of the recognition of exit costs in future financial
statements.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 2002 presentation.

NOTE  2 —

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN
    GOVERNMENT CLAIMS

HCA continues to be the subject of governmental
investigations and litigation relating to its business
practices. The governmental investigations were initiated more
than five years ago and include activities for certain entities
for periods prior to their acquisition by the Company and
activities for certain entities that have been divested.
Additionally, HCA is a defendant in several

qui tam

actions brought by private parties on behalf of the United
States of America.

In December 2000, HCA entered into a Plea
Agreement with the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice and various U.S. Attorneys’ Offices (the “Plea
Agreement”) and a Civil and Administrative Settlement
Agreement with the Civil Division of the Department of Justice
(the “Civil Agreement”). The agreements resolved all
Federal criminal issues outstanding against HCA and certain
issues involving Federal civil claims by, or on behalf of, the
government against HCA relating to DRG coding, outpatient
laboratory billing and home health issues. The civil issues that
were not covered by the Civil Agreement include claims related
to cost reports and physician relation issues. The Civil
Agreement was approved by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia in August 2001. HCA paid the government
$840 million (plus $60 million of accrued interest),
as provided by the Civil Agreement and Plea Agreement, during
2001. HCA also entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

On March 28, 2002, HCA announced that it had
reached an understanding with CMS to resolve all Medicare cost
report, home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA
and CMS (the “CMS Understanding”). The CMS
Understanding provides that HCA would pay CMS $250 million
with respect to these matters. The CMS Understanding was reached
as a means to resolve all outstanding appeals and more than
2,600 HCA cost reports for cost report periods ended on or
before July 31, 2001, many of which CMS has yet to audit.
The CMS Understanding is subject to approval by the Department
of Justice (“DOJ”), which has not yet been obtained,
and execution of a definitive written agreement.

The understanding with CMS resulted in HCA
recording a pretax charge of $260 million
($165 million after-tax), or $0.32 per basic and $0.30 per
diluted share, consisting of the accrual of $250 million
for the settlement payment and the write-off of $10 million
of net Medicare cost report receivables. This charge was
recorded in the consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

In December 2002, HCA reached an understanding
with attorneys for the Civil Division of the DOJ to recommend an
agreement whereby the United States would dismiss the various
claims it had brought related to physician relations, cost
reports and wound care issues (the “DOJ
Understanding”) in exchange for a payment of
$631 million, with interest accruing from February 3,
2003 to the payment date at a rate of 4.5%. The DOJ
Understanding would result in the dismissal of several

qui
tam

actions brought by private parties. The DOJ
Understanding is subject to court approval, and any of the
private parties who brought forth the actions could object to
the DOJ Understanding and have those objections considered by
the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia. Were the
DOJ Understanding to be approved, it would effectively end the

NOTE  2 —

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN
    GOVERNMENT CLAIMS (Continued)

DOJ investigation of the Company that was first
made public in 1997. However, the DOJ Understanding would not
affect

qui tam

cases in which the government has not
intervened. The CIA previously entered into by the Company would
remain in effect. The Company also reached an agreement in
principle with a negotiating team representing states that may
have similar claims against the Company. Under this agreement,
the Company would pay $17.5 million to state Medicaid
agencies to resolve any such claims. In addition, the Company
has accrued $35 million as an estimation of its legal
obligation to pay reasonable legal fees of the private parties.
As a result of the DOJ Understanding, HCA recorded a pretax
charge of $603 million ($418 million after-tax) in the
fourth quarter of 2002.

Under the Civil Agreement, HCA’s existing
Letter of Credit Agreement with the DOJ was reduced from
$1 billion to $250 million at the time of the
settlement payment. Upon the Company making the payments
provided under the DOJ Understanding, the Company would no
longer have any remaining obligation to maintain letters of
credit with the DOJ.

HCA remains the subject of a formal order of
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

HCA continues to cooperate in the governmental
investigations. Given the scope of the investigations and
current litigation, HCA anticipates continued investigative
activity to occur in these and other jurisdictions in the future.

While management remains unable to predict the
outcome of the investigations and litigation or the initiation
of any additional investigations or litigation, if HCA was found
to be in violation of Federal or state laws relating to
Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or breach of the CIA, HCA
could be subject to substantial monetary fines, civil and
criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or expenses
could have a material adverse effect on HCA’s financial
position, results of operations and liquidity. See
Note 11 — Contingencies and Part I,
Item 3: Legal Proceedings.

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, HCA recorded the
following pretax charges in connection with the governmental
investigations (dollars in millions):

The professional fees related to investigations
represent incremental legal and accounting expenses that are
being recognized on the basis of when the costs are incurred.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS

During 2002 and 2001, HCA acquired various
hospitals and health care entities (or controlling interests in
such entities), all of which were recorded using the purchase
method. The purchase price for each of these transactions was
allocated to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based upon their respective fair values. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts and operations of
acquired entities for periods subsequent to the respective
acquisition dates.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS (Continued)

The following is a summary of hospitals and other
health care entities acquired during 2002 and 2001 (dollars in
millions):

The purchase price paid in excess of the fair
value of identifiable net assets of acquired entities aggregated
$32 million in 2002 and $127 million in 2001. The pro
forma effect of these acquisitions on HCA’s results of
operations for the periods prior to the respective acquisition
dates was not significant.

During 2002, HCA recognized a net pretax gain of
$6 million ($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two
consolidating hospitals. During 2001, HCA recognized a net
pretax gain of $52 million ($28 million after-tax) on
the sales of three consolidating hospitals and HCA’s
interests in two non-consolidating hospitals. HCA also
recognized a pretax gain of $79 million ($48 million
after-tax) on the sale of a provider of specialty managed care
benefit programs. During 2000, HCA recognized a net pretax gain
of $34 million ($16 million after-tax) on the sales of
three consolidating hospitals. Proceeds from the sales were used
to repay bank borrowings.

During 2002, HCA announced the signing of a
definitive agreement for HCA to acquire the 14-hospital Health
Midwest system in Kansas City, Missouri for $1.125 billion.
HCA will also commit to make $450 million in capital
investments in the Kansas City market during the next five
years. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and
other customary conditions.

NOTE 4 — IMPAIRMENTS OF
LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2002, management decided to delay the
development and implementation of certain financial and
procurement information system components of its enterprise
resource planning program to concentrate and direct efforts to
the patient accounting and human resources information system
components. HCA reduced the carrying value for certain
capitalized costs associated with the information system
components that have been delayed, resulting in a pretax charge
of $19 million. The impact of the delayed components of the
enterprise resource planning program on HCA’s operations
was not significant.

During 2001, HCA reduced the carrying value for
its investment in a non-hospital, equity method joint venture to
fair value, based upon estimates of sales value, resulting in a
pretax charge of $17 million ($10 million after-tax).
This joint venture’s impact on HCA’s operations was
not significant.

During 2000, HCA management identified and
initiated plans to sell or replace four consolidating hospitals
and certain other assets. The carrying value for the hospitals
and other assets expected to be sold or replaced was reduced to
fair value of $40 million, based upon estimates of sales
values, resulting in a pretax charge of $117 million
($80 million after-tax). The impaired consolidating
hospitals which were expected to be sold had revenues (through
the date of sale or closure) of $9 million,
$51 million and $89 million for the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. These
facilities reported net losses (through the date of sale or
closure) before the pretax impairment charge and income taxes of
$13 million, $4 million and $7 million for the
years ended December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, one

one was continuing to be operated, one had been closed and one
had been sold. The proceeds of the sale approximated the
carrying value.

Management’s estimates of sales values are
generally based upon internal evaluations of each market that
include quantitative analyses of net revenues and cash flows,
reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and market
responses based upon discussions with and offers received from
potential buyers. The market responses are usually considered to
provide the most reliable estimates of fair value.

The asset impairment charges did not have a
significant impact on the Company’s cash flows and are not
expected to significantly impact cash flows for future periods.
The impaired facilities are classified as “held for
use” because economic and operational considerations
justify operating the facilities and marketing them as operating
enterprises, therefore depreciation has not been suspended. As a
result of the write-downs, depreciation expense related to these
assets will decrease in future periods. In the aggregate, the
net effect of the change in depreciation expense is not expected
to have a material effect on operating results for future
periods.

The impairment charges affected HCA’s asset
categories, as follows (dollars in millions):

The impairment charges affected HCA’s
operating segments, as follows (dollars in millions):

NOTE 5 — IMPAIRMENT OF
INVESTMENT SECURITIES

During the third quarter of 2002, HCA recorded an
other-than-temporary impairment charge on investment securities
of $168 million. The investment securities on which the
impairment charge was recorded were primarily equity securities
held by HCA’s insurance subsidiary. These investments are
classified as “available-for-sale,” and are carried at
fair value, with changes in temporary unrealized gains and
losses recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income.
The fair value of investments is generally based on quoted
market prices. At December 31, 2001, there were unrealized
losses totaling $7 million for equity securities with a
market decline for more than twelve months. This $7 million
unrealized loss amount related primarily to six securities with
unrealized loss amounts ranging from $0.6 million to $1.4
million each. Management did not identify specific problems with
any of these issuers and was optimistic that the overall market
would continue to recover from the September 2001 events that
had a negative impact on the overall market and the
Company’s investment portfolio.

During the first quarter of 2002, management
noted a slight improvement in the stock market, the economic
outlook and the Company’s investment portfolio, as
evidenced by unrealized losses on equity investments dropping
from $77 million at December 31, 2001 to $71 million
at March 31, 2002. The investment securities with
unrealized market declines for twelve months or more were
principally in three industry sectors: communications
($13 million), energy ($8 million) and technology
($13 million). The

Company’s investment managers and management
reviewed the financial attributes of the specific issuers and
determined that the market declines were considered to be
temporary.

During the second quarter of 2002, more financial
news regarding accounting irregularities became public and the
overall market appeared to be negatively influenced by these
reports. The equity investment portfolio unrealized losses
increased to $135 million at June 30, 2002 from
$71 million in the previous quarter. HCA’s investment
managers and management determined that the equity securities in
HCA’s portfolio had good future prospects and had been
unjustifiably tainted by the market’s reaction to issues
other than the financial attributes of the issuers.

During the third quarter of 2002, HCA’s
equity investment portfolio experienced an increase in
unrealized losses from $135 million at June 30, 2002
to $214 million at September 30, 2002. The
continuation of the portfolio decline during the third quarter
of 2002, combined with a perception of the trends developing in
the emphasis of amount of decline and time period in the
other-than-temporary impairment review process and the
consideration of possible alternatives regarding the
Company’s future, overall equity investment strategy,
caused management to determine that it had become difficult to
overcome the presumption that the identified investment
securities would not recover fair value equal to cost prior to
implementing any of the investment alternatives being considered
and that a $168 million other-than-temporary impairment
charge should be recognized in the third quarter of 2002. The
investment securities on which the impairment charge was
recognized were primarily concentrated in the communications and
technology industry sectors. Management’s review of the
individual investment securities included considerations of the
amount of market decline, the length of time the securities had
been in a decline position and issuer-specific financial
attributes. See Note 8 — Investments of Insurance
Subsidiary, for a summary of HCA’s insurance subsidiary
investment securities. The impairment charge affected the
“Investments of insurance subsidiary” asset category
and the “corporate and other” operating segment.

Deferred income taxes of $568 million and
$781 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, are included in other current assets. Noncurrent
deferred income tax liabilities totaled $292 million and
$438 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

The tax benefits associated with nonqualified
stock options increased the current tax receivable by
$82 million, $60 million, and $40 million in
2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Such benefits were recorded
as increases to stockholders’ equity.

At December 31, 2002, state net operating
loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2003 through 2022)
available to offset future taxable income approximated
$775 million. Utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards in any one year may be limited and, in certain
cases, result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Net
deferred tax assets related to such carryforwards are not
significant.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals
Division of the IRS, the United States Tax Court (the “Tax
Court”) and the United States Court of Federal Claims,
certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS
in conjunction with its examinations of HCA’s 1994-1998
Federal income tax returns, Columbia Healthcare
Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993 and 1994 Federal
income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of America,

returns. The disputed items include the amount of gain or loss
recognized on the divestiture of certain non-core business units
in 1998 and the allocation of costs among fixed assets and

goodwill in connection with certain hospitals
acquired by HCA in 1995 and 1996. The IRS is claiming an
additional $319 million in income taxes and interest
through December 31, 2002.

During 2001, the Company and the IRS filed
Stipulated Settlements with the Tax Court regarding the
IRS’ proposed disallowance of certain financing costs,
systems conversion costs and insurance premiums, which were
deducted in calculating taxable income and the allocation of
costs among fixed assets and goodwill in connection with certain
hospitals acquired by the Company in 1995 and 1996. The
settlement resulted in the Company’s payment of additional
tax and interest of $16 million and had no impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

During 2001, the Company filed an appeal with the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit with
respect to two Tax Court decisions received in 1996 related to
the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of America’s
1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns. HCA is contesting
the Tax Court decisions related to the method that Hospital
Corporation of America used to calculate its tax reserve for
doubtful accounts and the timing of deferred income recognition
in connection with its sales of certain subsidiaries to
Healthtrust in 1987.

During 2000, HCA and the IRS filed a Stipulated
Settlement with the Tax Court regarding the IRS’ proposed
disallowance of certain acquisition-related costs, executive
compensation and systems conversion costs, which were deducted
in calculating taxable income, and the methods of accounting
used by certain subsidiaries for calculating taxable income
related to vendor rebates and governmental receivables. The
settlement resulted in HCA’s payment of tax and interest of
$156 million and had no impact on HCA’s results of
operations.

During 2002, the IRS began an examination of
HCA’s 1999 through 2000 Federal income tax returns. HCA is
presently unable to estimate the amount of any additional income
tax and interest that the IRS may claim upon completion of this
examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have
been recorded to satisfy final resolution of the disputed
issues. Management believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation
of America and Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and
paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements
established with the IRS during previous examinations and that
final resolution of these disputes will not have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
position.

The fair value of investment securities is
generally based on quoted market prices.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
investments of HCA’s insurance subsidiary were classified
as “available for sale.” The aggregate common stock
investment is comprised of 390 equity positions at
December 31, 2002, with 221 positions reflecting unrealized
gains and 169 positions reflecting unrealized losses (none of
the individual unrealized loss positions exceed
$3 million). None of the equity positions with unrealized
losses at December 31, 2002 represent situations where
there is a continuous decline from cost for more than six
months. The equity positions (including those with unrealized
losses) at December 31, 2002, are not concentrated in a
particular industry.

Scheduled maturities of investments in debt
securities at December 31, 2002 were as follows (dollars in

The average expected maturity of the investments
in debt securities listed above approximated 4.4 years at
December 31, 2002. Expected and scheduled maturities may
differ because the issuers of certain securities may have the
right to call, prepay or otherwise redeem such obligations.

The tax equivalent yield (loss) on
investments (including common stocks) averaged (4.3%) for 2002,
9.2% for 2001 and 14.0% for 2000. The 2002 tax equivalent yield

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

HCA has entered into interest rate swap
agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. These swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments between two parties based on
common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.
Pay-floating swaps effectively convert fixed rate obligations to
LIBOR indexed variable rate instruments. The notional amounts
and timing of interest payments in these agreements match the
related liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis.

interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2002 (dollars

stock, subject to certain limitations.

Stock Repurchase
Programs

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock.
During 2002, HCA made open market purchases of 6.2 million
shares for $282 million.

In October 2001, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock.
During 2001, HCA made open market purchases of 6.4 million
shares for $250 million, completing the repurchase
authorization.

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a
financial institution that resulted in the financial institution
investing $400 million (at December 31, 2001) to
capitalize an entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This
consolidated affiliate acquired 16.8 million shares of HCA
common stock in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain
forward purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the
financial institution and received the 16.8 million shares
of the Company’s common stock. The financial
institution’s investment in the consolidated affiliate was
reflected in HCA’s balance sheet at December 31, 2001,
as “Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of
affiliate holding solely Company securities”. The quarterly
return on their investment, based upon a LIBOR plus 125 basis
points return rate during 2001, and based upon a LIBOR plus 87.5
basis points return rate during 2002, was recorded as minority
interest expense.

In March 2000, HCA announced that its Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of
its common stock. During 2000, HCA settled forward purchase
contracts associated with the March 2000 authorization
representing 11.7 million shares at a cost of
$300 million. During 2001, HCA settled the remaining
forward purchase contracts representing 19.6 million shares

During 2002, 2001 and 2000, the share repurchase
transactions reduced stockholders’ equity by
$282 million, $738 million and $1.643 billion,
respectively.

In connection with its share repurchase programs,
HCA entered into a Letter of Credit Agreement with the DOJ in
1999. As part of the agreement, HCA provided the government with
letters of credit totaling $1 billion. As provided under
the Civil Agreement with the government, as discussed in

Under the 1992 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the
Management Stock Purchase Plan (“MSPP”), HCA has made
grants of restricted shares or units of HCA’s common stock
to provide incentive compensation to key employees. Under the
performance equity plan, grants are made annually and are earned
based on the achievement of specified performance goals. These
shares have a two-year vesting period with half the shares
vesting at the end of the first year and the remainder vesting
at the end of the second year. The MSPP allows key employees to
defer an elected percentage (not to exceed 25%) of their base
salaries through the purchase of restricted stock at a 25%
discount from the average market price. Purchases of restricted
shares are made twice a year and the shares vest after three
years.

At December 31, 2002, 1,598,700 shares were

NOTE 14 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS

HCA maintains noncontributory, defined
contribution retirement plans covering substantially all
employees. Benefits are determined as a percentage of a
participant’s salary and are vested over specified periods
of employee service. Retirement plan expense was
$140 million for 2002, $128 million for 2001 and
$121 million for 2000. Amounts approximately equal to
retirement plan expense are funded annually.

HCA maintains various contributory benefit plans
that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
requirements. Certain of the plans require that HCA match
certain percentages of participants’ contributions up to
certain maximum levels (generally 50% of the first 3% of
compensation deferred by participants in 2002 and 2001, and 25%
of the first 3% of compensation deferred by participants in
2000). The cost of these plans totaled $47 million for
2002, $41 million for 2001 and $17 million for 2000.
HCA’s contributions are funded periodically during each
year.

During 2001 HCA adopted a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain key executives.
The plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the
participant receives a prescribed life annuity from a
combination of the SERP and the Company’s other benefit
plans. Compensation expense under the plan was $9 million
for 2002 and $2 million for 2001. Benefits accrued under
this plan totaled $30 million at December 31, 2002,
and $19 million at December 31, 2001.

HCA maintains certain defined benefit pension
plans that resulted from acquisitions of six hospitals in prior
years. All of the acquired plans have been frozen, closed to new
entrants, or replaced with new plans that are closed to new
entrants. Compensation expense under these plans was
$8 million for 2002, $2 million for 2001, and zero for

amortization and assets. EBITDA is defined as income before
depreciation and amortization, interest expense, settlement with
Federal government, gains on sales of facilities, impairment of
investment securities, impairment of long-lived assets,
investigation related costs, loss on retirement of debt,
minority interests and income taxes. HCA uses EBITDA as an
analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to
geographic areas and assessing their performance. EBITDA is
commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care
industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and
debt service ability. EBITDA should not be considered as a
measure of financial performance under generally accepted
accounting principles, and the items excluded from EBITDA are
significant components in understanding and assessing financial
performance. Because EBITDA is not a measurement determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is
thus susceptible to varying calculations, EBITDA as presented
may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of
other companies. The geographic distributions, restated for the
transfers of certain facilities to the Corporate and other group
from the Eastern and Western Groups, of HCA’s revenues,
equity in earnings of affiliates, EBITDA, depreciation and
amortization, assets and goodwill are summarized in the
following table (dollars in millions):
