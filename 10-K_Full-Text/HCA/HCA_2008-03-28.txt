PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in
    the United States. At December 31, 2007, we operated 169
    hospitals, comprised of 163 general, acute care hospitals; five
    psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. The 169
    hospital total includes eight hospitals (seven general, acute
    care hospitals and one rehabilitation hospital) owned by joint
    ventures in which an affiliate of HCA is a partner, and these
    joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. In
    addition, we operated 108 freestanding surgery centers, nine of
    which are owned by joint ventures in which an affiliate of HCA
    is a partner, and these joint ventures are accounted for using
    the equity method. Our facilities are located in 20 states
    and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,”
    “we,” “our” or “us,” as used
    herein, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise
    stated or indicated by context. The term “affiliates”
    means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and
    partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
    partners. The terms “facilities” or
    “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
    affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to
    employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide the communities we serve a
    comprehensive array of quality health care services in the most
    cost-effective manner possible. Our general, acute care
    hospitals typically provide a full range of services to
    accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine,
    general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics
    and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic and emergency services.
    Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by
    our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers,
    diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our
    psychiatric hospitals provide a full range of mental health care
    services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and
    outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
    reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal
    executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville,
    Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is

(615) 344-9551.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. completed its merger (the
    “Merger”) with Hercules Acquisition Corporation,
    pursuant to which the Company was acquired by Hercules Holding
    II, LLC (“Hercules Holding”), a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group including
    affiliates of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
    Co., Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity (each a
    “Sponsor”) and affiliates of HCA founder,
    Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., (the “Frist Entities,”
    and together with the Sponsors, the “Investors”), and
    by members of management and certain other investors. The
    Merger, the financing transactions related to the Merger and
    other related transactions are collectively referred to in this
    annual report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger
    was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial
    statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our
    assets and liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees and certain other
    investors. Our common stock is not registered under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not traded
    on a national securities exchange. Effective September 26,
    2007, we registered certain of our senior secured notes issued
    in connection with the Recapitalization with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), thus subjecting us to
    the reporting requirements of Section 15(d) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

•

maintain our dedication to the care and improvement of human
    life;

•

maintain our commitment to ethics and compliance;

•

leverage our leading local market positions;

•

expand our presence in key markets;

•

continue to leverage our scale;

•

continue to develop enduring physician relationships; and

•

become the health care employer of choice.

Health
    Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals; freestanding
    surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
    oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
    physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2007, we owned and operated 156 general,
    acute care hospitals with 37,915 licensed beds, and an
    additional seven general, acute care hospitals with 2,237
    licensed beds are operated through joint ventures, which are
    accounted for using the equity method. Most of our general,
    acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services,
    including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care,
    diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute
    care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as
    outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy,
    cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized
    medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board,
    made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical
    research and education programs. However, some of our hospitals
    are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the
    clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other
    education programs.

At December 31, 2007, we operated five psychiatric
    hospitals with 490 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
    provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and
    adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug
    abuse treatment and counseling.

Outpatient health care facilities operated by us include
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers,
    comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
    centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
    various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
    integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive
    health care networks in select communities.

In addition to providing capital resources, certain of our
    affiliates provide a variety of management services to our
    health care facilities, including patient safety programs;
    ethics and compliance programs; national supply contracts;
    equipment purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting,
    financial and clinical systems; governmental reimbursement
    assistance; construction planning and coordination; information
    technology systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resources
    services; and internal audit services.



Sources
    of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
    provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
    the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
    reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
    depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
    medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the
    geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels
    fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
    control.

We receive payment for patient services from the federal
    government under the Medicare program, state governments under
    their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care
    plans, private insurers and directly from patients. The
    approximate percentages of our patient revenues from such
    sources were as follows:

(a)

Prior to 2006, managed Medicare revenues were classified as
    managed care.

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
    medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
    disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
    Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states,
    which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying
    individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our
    general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are
    certified as health care services providers for persons covered
    under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under
    Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less
    than established hospital gross charges for the services
    provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges
    to certain group purchasers of health care services, including
    private insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other
    managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit our
    ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs.
    See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
    Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
    between established hospital gross charges and amounts
    reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs or
    PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the
    extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of
    their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
    coinsurance has been increasing each year. Collection of amounts
    due from individuals is typically more difficult than from
    governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to
    uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
    care. These discounts are similar to those provided to many
    local managed care plans. In implementing the discount policy,
    we attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other
    federal or state assistance or charity care. If an uninsured
    patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured
    discount is applied.

Medicare

Inpatient
    Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a
    prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
    care hospital inpatient services. Under hospital inpatient PPS,
    fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established
    based on the patient’s assigned diagnosis related group
    (“DRG”). DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
    according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources
    necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. DRG
    weights represent the average resources for a given DRG relative
    to the average



resources for all DRGs. When the cost to treat certain patients
    falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically
    receive additional “outlier” payments. DRG payments
    are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than
    those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for
    inpatient capital costs based on DRG weights multiplied by a
    geographically adjusted federal rate.

DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are recalibrated each
    federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to
    update the DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives
    consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and
    entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods
    and services. However, for several years the percentage
    increases to the DRG rates have been lower than the percentage
    increases in the costs of goods and services purchased by
    hospitals. In federal fiscal year 2007, the DRG rate increase
    was market basket of 3.4%. For federal fiscal year 2008, the
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) set
    the DRG rate increase at full market basket of 3.3%.

In August 2006, CMS changed the methodology used to recalibrate
    the DRG weights from

charge-based

weights to cost relative weights under a three-year transition
    period beginning in federal fiscal year 2007. The adoption of
    the cost relative weights is not anticipated to have a material
    financial impact on us. On August 22, 2007, CMS published a
    final rule which adopts a two-year implementation of
    Medicare-Severity Diagnostic-Related Groups
    (“MS-DRGs”), a severity-adjusted DRG system. This
    change represents a refinement to the existing DRG system, and
    its impact on our revenues has not been significant.
    Additionally, CMS has imposed a documentation and coding
    adjustment to account for changes in payments under the new
    MS-DRG system that are not related to changes in case mix.
    Through legislative refinement, the documentation and coding
    adjustments for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are
    reductions to the base payment rate of 0.6% and 0.9%,
    respectively. However, Congress has given CMS the ability to
    retrospectively determine if the documentation and coding
    adjustment levels for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 were
    adequate to account for changes in payments not related to
    changes in case mix. If the levels are found to have been
    inadequate, CMS can impose an adjustment to payments for federal
    fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Further realignments in the DRG system could also reduce the
    payments we receive for certain specialties, including
    cardiology and orthopedics. The greater proliferation of
    specialty hospitals in recent years has caused CMS to focus on
    payment levels for such specialties. Changes in the payments
    received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on
    our revenues.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
    Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provided for DRG rate increases
    for certain federal fiscal years at full market basket, if data
    for 10 patient care quality indicators were submitted to
    the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
    (“HHS”). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA
    2005”) expanded and provided for the future expansion of
    the number of quality measures that must be reported to receive
    a full market basket update. On November 1, 2007, CMS
    announced a final rule that expands to 30 the number of quality
    measures that hospitals are required to report, beginning with
    discharges occurring in calendar year 2008, in order to qualify
    for the full market basket update to the inpatient prospective
    payment system in federal fiscal year 2009. Failure to submit
    the required quality indicators will result in a two percentage
    point reduction to the market basket update. All of our
    hospitals paid under Medicare inpatient DRG PPS are
    participating in the quality initiative by the Secretary of HHS
    by submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor
    to comply with all data submission requirements as additional
    requirements continue to be added, our submissions may not be
    deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market
    basket adjustment for all of our hospitals.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of
    Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. CMS
    estimates that outlier payments accounted for 3.96% and 4.65% of
    total operating DRG payments for federal fiscal years 2005 and
    2006, respectively. For federal fiscal year 2007, CMS
    established an outlier threshold of $24,485, which resulted in
    outlier payments, estimated by CMS, to be 4.60% of total
    operating DRG payments. For federal fiscal year 2008, CMS has
    established an outlier threshold of $22,185. We do not
    anticipate that the change to the outlier threshold for federal
    fiscal year 2008 will have a material impact on our revenues.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
    Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
    who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS has
    continued to use existing fee schedules to pay for



physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical
    equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services and
    nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery
    centers services and services provided by independent diagnostic
    testing facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into
    groups called ambulatory payment classifications
    (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
    and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
    established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
    hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
    The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2006 and
    2007 by market baskets of 3.70% and 3.40%, respectively.
    However, as a result of the expiration of additional payments
    for drugs that were being paid in calendar year 2005, for
    calendar year 2006 there was an effective 2.25% reduction to the
    market basket of 3.70%, resulting in a net increase of 1.45%.
    This reduction was not applied in calendar year 2007 and
    subsequent years. On November 27, 2007 CMS published a
    final rule that updated payment rates for calendar year 2008 by
    the full market basket of 3.30%. In this final rule, CMS
    outlined the requirements for hospitals to submit quality data
    relating to outpatient care in order to receive the full market
    basket increase under the outpatient PPS beginning in calendar
    year 2009. CMS requires that data on seven quality measures be
    submitted according to a data submission schedule. Hospitals
    that fail to submit such data will receive the market basket
    update minus two percentage points for the outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities
    (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under IRF PPS, patients are
    classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
    comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the
    patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a
    predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
    patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
    levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
    For federal fiscal years 2006 and 2007, CMS updated the PPS rate
    for rehabilitation hospitals and units by market baskets of 3.6%
    and 3.3%, respectively. However, CMS also applied reductions to
    the standard payment amount of 1.9% and 2.6% for federal fiscal
    years 2006 and 2007, respectively, to account for coding changes
    that do not reflect real changes in case mix. For federal fiscal
    year 2008, CMS has updated the PPS rate for IRFs by market
    basket of 3.2% with no corresponding reduction for coding
    changes. However, the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP
    Reauthorization Act of 2007, signed into law on
    December 29, 2007, eliminates the market basket update as
    of April 1, 2008 and continues the zero update through
    federal fiscal year 2009. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    one rehabilitation hospital, which is operated through a joint
    venture, and 48 hospital rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
    criteria for being classified as an IRF, commonly known as the
    “75% rule.” CMS revised the medical conditions for
    patients served by rehabilitation facilities from 10 medical
    conditions to 13 conditions. Pursuant to this final rule, a
    specified percentage of a facility’s inpatients over a
    given year must be treated for one of these conditions. The
    final rule provides for a transition period during which the
    percentage threshold would increase, starting at a 50%
    compliance threshold and culminating at a 75% threshold, for
    cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2007.
    Since then, several adjustments have been made to the transition
    period. The passage of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP
    Reauthorization Act of 2007, set the compliance threshold at 60%
    for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1,
    2006. Implementation of the “75% rule” has reduced our
    IRF admissions and can be expected to continue to significantly
    restrict the treatment of patients whose medical conditions do
    not meet any of the 13 approved conditions.

Psychiatric

PPS for inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric
    hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals
    and critical access hospitals (“IPF PPS”) became
    effective for reporting periods beginning subsequent to
    December 31, 2004. IPF PPS is a per diem payment, with
    adjustments to account for certain patient and facility
    characteristics. IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy
    for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a
    facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service
    emergency department. IPF PPS was implemented over a three-year
    transition period with full payment under IPF PPS to begin with
    cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
    2008. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner
    intended to be budget neutral and has adopted a July 1 update
    cycle. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care (RPL)
    market basket update is used



to update the IPF PPS. The annual RPL market basket update for
    rate year 2008 is 3.2%. As of December 31, 2007, we had
    five psychiatric hospitals and 32 hospital psychiatric units.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area
    differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
    reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area
    compared to the national average wage level. In federal fiscal
    years 2007 and 2008, CMS adjusted 100% of the wage index factor
    for occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index
    changes, while slightly negative in the aggregate, is not
    anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2008.

CMS has a significant initiative underway that could affect the
    administration of the Medicare program and impact how hospitals
    bill and receive payment for covered Medicare services. In
    accordance with MMA, CMS has initiated the implementation of
    contractor reform whereby CMS will competitively bid the
    Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to
    15 Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”).
    Hospital companies will have the option to work with the
    selected MAC in the jurisdiction where a given hospital is
    located or, in the case of chain providers, to use the MAC in
    the jurisdiction where the hospital company’s home office
    is located. For chain providers, either all hospitals in the
    chain must choose to stay with the MAC chosen for their locality
    or all hospitals must opt to use the home office MAC. HCA has
    chosen to use the MACs assigned to the localities in which our
    hospitals are located. CMS awarded one MAC contract in 2006, and
    during 2007, CMS was expected to award seven MAC contracts.
    However, during 2007, CMS only awarded four of the seven MAC
    contracts, bringing the total number of MAC contracts awarded to
    five.

The remaining seven MAC jurisdictions are expected to be awarded
    in July and September of 2008. All of these changes could impact
    claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow;
    however, we are unable to predict the impact at this time.

The MMA of 2003 established the Recovery Audit Contractor
    (“RAC”) three-year demonstration program to conduct
    post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in
    the fee-for-service Medicare program. Beginning in 2005, CMS
    contracted with three different RACs to conduct these reviews in
    California, Florida and New York. The program was expanded in
    August 2007 to include Massachusetts and South Carolina. Each
    RAC had discretion over the types of reviews and record requests
    it would conduct within the states for which it was responsible
    as long as it followed the CMS-defined Statement of Work. HCA
    had 45 hospitals subject to the demonstration of which 40 of
    those hospitals actually had a review performed. The Tax Relief
    and Health Care Act of 2006 made the RAC program permanent and
    mandated its nationwide expansion by 2010. The final impact of
    the demonstration program cannot be quantified at this time.

CMS reimburses ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”)
    using a predetermined fee schedule. Effective January 1,
    2007, as a result of DRA 2005, reimbursements for ASC overhead
    costs were limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to
    hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital
    outpatient PPS for the same procedure. On August 2, 2007,
    CMS issued final regulations that changed payments for
    procedures performed in an ASC. Effective January 1, 2008,
    ASC payment groups increased from nine clinically disparate
    payment groups to an extensive list of covered surgical
    procedures among the APCs used under the outpatient PPS for
    these surgical services. CMS estimates that the rates for
    procedures performed in an ASC setting equal 65% of the
    corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an
    outpatient hospital setting. Moreover, if CMS determines that a
    procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office,
    the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the
    reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician
    Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. In addition, all surgical
    procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk
    or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC
    procedures. This rule expands the number of procedures that
    Medicare will pay for if performed in an ASC. Because the new
    payment system has a significant impact on payments for certain
    procedures, the final rule establishes a four-year transition
    period for implementing the required payment rates. This change
    may result in more Medicare procedures that are now performed in
    hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our
    hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed
    in ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial
    third-party payers may adopt similar policies.



Hospital operating margins have been, and may continue to be,
    under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing
    flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in
    excess of the increase in PPS payments under the Medicare
    program.

Managed
    Medicare

Managed Medicare plans relate to situations where a private
    company contracts with CMS to provide members with Medicare
    Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed
    Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs, or private
    fee-for-service plans.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government
    and the states and are administered by states under approved
    plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
    or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual
    hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a
    hospital’s cost of services. The federal government and
    many states are currently considering altering the level of
    Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
    eligibility that could adversely affect future levels of
    Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. As permitted
    by law, certain states in which we operate have adopted
    broad-based provider taxes to fund their Medicaid programs.

Since states must operate with balanced budgets and since the
    Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DRA 2005
    includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over
    five years. On May 29, 2007, CMS published a final rule
    entitled “Medicaid Program; Cost Limit for Providers
    Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the
    Integrity of Federal-State Financial Partnership”. Congress
    enacted a moratorium on this rule delaying its implementation
    until 2008. However, when the moratorium expires in May 2008,
    this final rule could significantly impact state Medicaid
    programs. In its proposed form, this rule was expected to reduce
    federal Medicaid funding by $12.2 billion over five years.
    As a result of the moratorium on implementing the final rule,
    the impact of the final rule has not been quantified. States
    have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to
    reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid
    recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems. Future legislation or other
    changes in the administration or interpretation of government
    health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

Managed
    Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs relate to situations where states
    contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care
    management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not
    give up program responsibilities for financing, eligibility
    criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract
    directly with one of the designated entities, usually a managed
    care organization. The provisions of these programs are
    state-specific.

Annual
    Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
    TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
    under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
    requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
    require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
    revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
    provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
    recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
    adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us
    under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require
    several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to
    or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of
    appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
    cost reports.



Managed
    Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges
    to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
    including managed care plans and private insurance companies.
    Admissions reimbursed by managed care and other insurers were
    37%, 36% and 42% of our total admissions for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively (prior to
    2006, managed Medicare admissions, 7% and 6% of 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, admissions, were classified as managed care).
    Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for one-year or
    two-year terms. While we generally received annual average yield
    increases of six to seven percent from managed care payers
    during 2007, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    receive increases in the future.

Hospital
    Utilization

We believe that the most important factors relating to the
    overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
    position of the hospital and the number and quality of
    physicians and other health care professionals providing patient
    care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a
    hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
    services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and
    convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that
    impact utilization include the growth in local population, local
    economic conditions and market penetration of managed care
    programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
    our hospitals. Hospital operations are subject to certain
    seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient
    utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold
    weather months.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
    most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered
    by our hospitals. Additionally, in the past several years the
    number of freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic centers
    (including facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic
    areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a
    result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive
    environment. The rates charged by our hospitals are intended to
    be competitive with those charged by other local hospitals for
    similar services. In some cases, competing hospitals are more
    established than our hospitals. Some competing hospitals are
    owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others are
    owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by
    endowments, charitable contributions and tax revenues, and are
    exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions
    and support are not available to our hospitals. In certain
    localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide
    highly specialized facilities, equipment and services which may
    not be available at most of our hospitals. We are facing
    increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals
    and freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin
    services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas
    outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric
    hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals,
    including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
    competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local
    communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality
    of care; ability to attract and retain quality physicians,
    skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals;
    location; breadth of services; technology offered and prices
    charged. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient
    services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
    for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for
    physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
    of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
    affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may at any
    time terminate their affiliation with a hospital operated by us,
    our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties
    on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other
    qualified physicians. We believe that physicians refer patients
    to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services
    it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians
    on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the
    quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and
    employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide
    quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for
    physicians and patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
    is management’s ability to negotiate service contracts with
    purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans
    attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and
    obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges.
    In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are
    increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations
    with hospitals for



managed care programs and discounts from established gross
    charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with
    group health care services purchasers on the basis of price,
    market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of
    services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. In
    addition, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity
    provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the
    ability of managed care companies to contract with us. The
    importance of obtaining contracts with managed care
    organizations varies from community to community, depending on
    the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
    limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
    services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
    make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
    restricting competition. In those states which have no CON laws
    or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they
    become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form
    of new services, facilities and capital spending is more
    prevalent. See Item 1, “Business —
    Regulation and Other Factors.”

We, and the health care industry as a whole, face the challenge
    of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
    rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
    medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
    and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider
    services by private and government payers remain ongoing
    challenges.

Admissions and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively
    affected by payer-required preadmission authorization,
    utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and
    alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill
    patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer
    pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we
    intend to expand many of our facilities or acquire or construct
    new facilities to better enable the provision of a comprehensive
    array of outpatient services, offer discounts to private payer
    groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and offer new or
    expanded programs and services.

Regulation
    and Other Factors

Licensure,
    Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
    numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the
    adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
    policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
    prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
    environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
    assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
    for licensing and accreditation. We believe that our health care
    facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
    All of our general, acute care hospitals are certified for
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are
    accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose
    its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its
    certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the
    facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. Management believes our
    facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable
    federal, state, local and independent review body regulations
    and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and
    accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain
    qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements
    for licensure also may include notification or approval in the
    event of the transfer or change of ownership. Failure to obtain
    the necessary state approval in these circumstances can result
    in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of
    ownership.

Certificates
    of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care
    facilities, the construction or expansion of health care
    facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer
    or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services
    may be subject to review by and prior approval of state
    regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally
    require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need
    for additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
    Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
    inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
    change ownership.



State
    Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
    review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
    assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
    within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have
    not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
    Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that
    mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we
    will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states
    in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating
    such reviews.

Utilization
    Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that
    services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients
    meet professionally recognized standards, are medically
    necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed.
    These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of
    admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by
    quality improvement organizations to assess the appropriateness
    of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the
    quality of care provided, the validity of DRG classifications
    and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay
    or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for
    services provided, may assess fines and also have the authority
    to recommend to HHS that a provider, which is in substantial
    noncompliance with the appropriate standards, be excluded from
    participating in the Medicare program. Most nongovernmental
    managed care organizations also require utilization review.

Federal
    Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
    and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
    the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
    hospital’s participation in the federal health care
    programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
    be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
    or both.

Anti-kickback
    Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
    “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
    from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
    paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
    or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care
    program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly.
    Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a
    criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or
    imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
    violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of
    the remuneration

and/or

exclusion from participation in federal health care programs,
    including Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have held that there is
    a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of
    the renumeration is to generate referrals, even if there are
    other lawful purposes.

The Office of Inspector General at HHS (“OIG”), among
    other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
    eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
    mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
    and inspections. As one means of providing guidance to health
    care providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
    These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
    of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the
    arrangements or transactions violate the Anti-kickback Statute
    or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified
    several incentive arrangements, which, if accompanied by
    inappropriate intent, constitute suspect practices, including:
    (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a
    physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of
    free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in
    facilities usually located close to the hospital,
    (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing,
    nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a
    physician’s office staff in areas such as management
    techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which
    provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a
    predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
    remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or
    loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to
    the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a
    physician’s travel and expenses for conferences,
    (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance
    plans at an inappropriately low cost to the



physician, (i) payment for services (which may include
    consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any,
    substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods
    or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair
    market value, and (k) rental of space in physician offices,
    at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to
    which physicians refer. The OIG has encouraged persons having
    information about hospitals who offer the above types of
    incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of
    providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins,
    along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain
    arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities, including:
    (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
    venture arrangements between those in a position to refer
    business, such as physicians, and those providing items or
    services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and
    (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the
    practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
    hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
    the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory
    Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for
    certain types of health care providers. In January 2005, the OIG
    published Supplemental Compliance Guidance for Hospitals,
    supplementing its 1998 guidance for the hospital industry. In
    the supplemental guidance, the OIG identifies a number of risk
    areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations.
    These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with
    physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint
    venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
    regulations that outline categories of activities that are
    deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
    Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe
    harbors for various activities, including the following:
    investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
    practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management
    contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
    discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
    beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
    arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
    investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
    ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty
    services. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does
    not fall within a safe harbor, or that it is identified in a
    fraud alert or advisory bulletin or as a risk area in the
    Supplemental Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals, does not
    automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal
    under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and
    business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities. Although the Company
    believes that its arrangements with physicians and other
    referral sources have been structured to comply with current law
    and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that
    regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these
    financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute
    or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject
    the Company to liabilities under the Social Security Act,
    including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and
    exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other
    federal health care programs.

Stark
    Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
    as the “Stark Law.” This law effectively prohibits
    physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to
    entities with which they or any of their immediate family
    members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide
    certain “designated health services” that are
    reimbursable by Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient
    hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology
    services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial
    of payment, refunding amounts received for services provided
    pursuant to prohibited referrals, civil monetary penalties of up
    to $15,000 per prohibited service provided, and exclusion from
    the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute also provides
    for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme.
    There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many
    of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and
    providers, including employment contracts, leases and
    recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a
    physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, as
    opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department.
    Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which
    compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every
    requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in
    violation of the Stark Law.



CMS has issued three phases of final regulations implementing
    the Stark Law. Phases I and II became effective in January
    2002 and July 2004, respectively, and Phase III became
    effective in December 2007. While these regulations help clarify
    the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is
    unclear how the government will interpret many of these
    exceptions for enforcement purposes. In addition, CMS recently
    proposed changes to the regulations implementing the Stark Law
    that would further restrict the types of arrangements that
    facilities and physicians may enter, including additional
    restrictions on certain leases, percentage compensation
    arrangements, and agreements under which a hospital purchases
    services under arrangements. There can be no assurance that the
    arrangements entered into by us and our facilities will be found
    to be in compliance with the Stark Law, as it ultimately may be
    implemented or interpreted.

In 2003, Congress passed legislation that modified the hospital
    ownership exception to the Stark Law by creating an

18-month

moratorium on allowing physicians to own interests in new
    specialty hospitals. The moratorium was extended by regulatory
    and legislative action and expired on August 8, 2006. At
    the conclusion of the moratorium, HHS announced that it will
    require hospitals to disclose certain financial arrangements
    with physicians. On September 14, 2007, CMS published an
    information collection request called the Disclosure of
    Financial Relationships Report (“DFRR”). HHS will
    initially select 500 hospitals that will be required to report
    the financial arrangements with physicians as required in the
    DFRR. Those hospitals are comprised of 290 hospitals that failed
    to respond to a previous voluntary CMS questionnaire about
    investments and compensation relationships and 210 additional
    hospitals. The DFRR and its supporting documentation are
    currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget
    and have not yet been released.

Similar
    State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws that prohibit
    payments to physicians for patient referrals, similar to the
    Anti-kickback Statute and self-referral legislation similar to
    the Stark Law. The scope of these state laws is broad, since
    they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for
    care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or
    enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and
    civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.

Other
    Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
    (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and
    abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care
    fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The
    Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties
    for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid.
    False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for
    services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
    rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
    unnecessary goods and services, and cost report fraud. Federal
    enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare
    and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees
    associated with business entities that have committed health
    care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no
    knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be
    imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including
    failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing
    arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in
    excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration
    to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection
    of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or
    entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program,
    making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or
    limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in
    return for referring an individual for an item or service
    payable by a federal healthcare program. Like the Anti-kickback
    Statute, these provisions are very broad. To avoid liability,
    providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately
    code claims for reimbursement, as well as accurately prepare
    cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary
    Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud
    and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil
    monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and
    in some cases may result in penalties of up to three times the
    remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition,
    a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state
    healthcare programs. Federal and state governments increasingly
    use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where
    they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof



requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further,
    individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information
    on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at
    least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity
    Program.

The
    Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

The

qui tam,

or whistleblower, provisions of the federal
    False Claims Act allow private individuals to bring actions on
    behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has
    defrauded the federal government. Further, the government may
    use the False Claims Act to prosecute Medicare and other
    government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing
    for services not provided and submitting false cost reports.
    When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable
    under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay
    three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus
    mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each
    separate false claim. There are many potential bases for
    liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises
    when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement
    to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term
    “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not
    give rise to liability under the False Claims Act, submitting a
    claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
    constitutes a “knowing” submission under the False
    Claims Act and, therefore, will qualify for liability.

In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and some
    courts have taken the position that providers who allegedly have
    violated other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and
    the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the
    False Claims Act. A number of states in which we operate have
    adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own
    whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a
    civil lawsuit in state court.

HIPAA
    Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
    the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
    certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
    received electronically. These provisions are intended to
    encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
    has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
    Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
    is mandatory for our facilities. HHS has proposed a rule that
    would establish standards for electronic health care claims
    attachments. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider
    receive, and by May 23, 2008 exclusively use, a National
    Provider Identifier. We believe that the cost of compliance with
    these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a
    material, adverse effect on our business, financial position or
    results of operations.

Pursuant to HIPAA, HHS adopted standards to protect the privacy
    and security of individually identifiable health-related
    information. The privacy regulations control the use and
    disclosure of individually identifiable health-related
    information, whether communicated electronically, on paper or
    orally. The regulations also provide patients with significant
    new rights related to understanding and controlling how their
    health information is used or disclosed. The security
    regulations require health care providers to implement and
    maintain administrative, physical and technical practices to
    protect the security of individually identifiable health
    information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. We
    enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with
    HIPAA privacy and security requirements and under which a HIPAA
    compliance group monitors our compliance. The privacy
    regulations and security regulations have and will continue to
    impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply
    with these standards.

Violations of HIPAA could result in civil penalties of up to
    $25,000 per type of violation in each calendar year and criminal
    penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. In addition, there
    are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at the
    federal and state levels addressing patient privacy concerns.
    Facilities will continue to remain subject to any federal or
    state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the
    privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and
    could impose additional penalties.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical
    Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This
    federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare
    program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination
    of every individual who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual



is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
    stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the
    individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The
    obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions
    exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
    treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital
    fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an
    individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
    order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
    pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary
    penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare
    program. In addition, an injured individual, the
    individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a
    financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation
    of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
    which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s
    emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
    treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
    hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
    or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
    certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to
    individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government also
    has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA
    violations actively in the future. We believe our hospitals
    operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate
    Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting
    corporations and other entities from employing physicians,
    practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and
    indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health
    care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of
    patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for
    medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation
    of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and
    criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the
    corporation and the physician may be considered void and
    unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are
    often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or
    regulatory agencies.

Health
    Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
    years on the hospital industry. While we are currently not aware
    of any material investigations of the Company under federal or
    state health care laws or regulations, it is possible that
    governmental entities could initiate investigations or
    litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such
    matters could result in significant penalties, as well as
    adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and
    managers could be included in governmental investigations or
    litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental
    billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We
    continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have
    developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is
    designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and
    constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation
    may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or
    industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations,
    governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
    issues, including some for which little official interpretation
    previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent
    with practices that have been common within the industry and
    that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some
    instances, government investigations that have in the past been
    conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be
    conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their
    focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement
    efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of
    Justice have, from time to time, established national
    enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers, that
    focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of
    abuse.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and
    state investigations relate to a wide variety of routine health
    care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices,
    including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with
    referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician
    joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices
    for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health
    care operations and other



activities that could be the subject of governmental
    investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant
    Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements
    with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and
    joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Any
    additional investigations of the Company, our executives or
    managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to
    us, as well as adverse publicity.

Commencing in 1997, we became aware we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. As part of the investigations, the United
    States intervened in a number of

qui tam

actions brought
    by private parties. The investigations related to, among other
    things, DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing, home health
    issues, physician relations, cost report and wound care issues.
    The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements
    executed in 2000 and 2003 with the Criminal Division of the
    Department of Justice, the Civil Division of the Department of
    Justice, various U.S. Attorneys’ offices, CMS, a
    negotiating team representing states with claims against us, and
    others. In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (the “CIA”) with the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
    Services. Violation or breach of the CIA, or other violation of
    federal or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar
    programs, could subject us to substantial monetary fines, civil
    and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs and other federal and state health care programs.
    Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or through
    private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed against us as
    a result of such actions could have a material, adverse effect
    on our results of operations and financial position.

Health
    Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in the United
    States and continues to attract much legislative interest and
    public attention. In recent years, various legislative proposals
    have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state
    legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care
    system, either nationally or at the state level. Many states
    have enacted, or are considering enacting, measures designed to
    reduce their Medicaid expenditures and change private health
    care insurance. States have also adopted, or are considering,
    legislation designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility,
    enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    states’ Medicaid systems. Some states, including the states
    in which we operate, have applied for and have been granted
    federal waivers from current Medicaid regulations to allow them
    to serve some or all of their Medicaid participants through
    managed care providers. Hospital operating margins have been,
    and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of
    deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and growth
    in operating expenses in excess of the increase in PPS payments
    under the Medicare program.

Compliance
    Program and Corporate Integrity Agreement

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
    is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
    awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
    emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
    regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we
    provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees
    and encourage all employees to report any violations to their
    supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
    telephone ethics line.

Our CIA is structured to assure the federal government of our
    overall federal health care program compliance and specifically
    covers DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and physician
    relations. We underwent major training efforts to ensure that
    our employees learned and applied the policies and procedures
    implemented under the CIA and our ethics and compliance program.
    The CIA has had the effect of increasing the amount of
    information we provide to the federal government regarding our
    health care practices and our compliance with federal
    regulations. Under the CIA, we have numerous affirmative
    obligations, including the requirement that we report potential
    violations of applicable federal health care laws and
    regulations and have, pursuant to this obligation, reported a
    number of potential violations of the Stark Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, EMTALA, HIPAA and other laws, most of
    which we consider to be nonviolations or technical violations.
    This obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory
    authorities. The government could determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues



has been inadequate. Breach of the CIA

and/or

a
    finding of violations of applicable health care laws or
    regulations could subject us to repayment requirements,
    substantial monetary penalties, civil penalties, exclusion from
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties.

Antitrust
    Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
    laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
    anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
    refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
    tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
    practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
    competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can
    result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
    penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
    currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe
    we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but
    future review of our practices by courts or regulatory
    authorities could result in a determination that could adversely
    affect our operations.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
    ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment. Management does not believe that we will be
    required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with
    these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially
    affect our capital expenditures, results of operations or
    financial condition.

Insurance

As typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims
    and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
    business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has
    obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally
    above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We
    also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
    our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for
    directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts
    that we believe are customary for our industry. The directors
    and officers liability coverage includes a $25 million
    corporate deductible for the periods prior to the Merger and a
    $1 million corporate deductible subsequent to the Merger.
    The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on
    the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from
    $500,000 per claim up to 5% of the affected property values for
    certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees
    and Medical Staff

At December 31, 2007 we had approximately
    186,000 employees, including approximately
    50,000 part-time employees. References herein to
    “employees” refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.
    We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate
    wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating
    to employment. Employees at 21 of our hospitals were represented
    by various labor unions at December 31, 2007 and 2006. We
    consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our
    hospitals, as well as others, have experienced some recent union
    organizational activity. We had elections at two hospitals in
    California and one in Missouri during 2007. We do not expect
    such efforts to materially affect our future operations. Our
    hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced labor costs
    rising faster than the general inflation rate. In some markets,
    nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a
    significant operating issue to health care providers. To address
    this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to
    improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and
    productivity. We may also be required to increase the
    utilization of more expensive temporary or contract personnel.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, who generally
    are not employees of our hospitals. However, some physicians
    provide services in our hospitals under contracts which
    generally describe a term of service,



provide and establish the duties and obligations of such
    physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance
    criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed
    physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any
    of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the
    appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with
    established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to
    the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often
    also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may
    terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any
    time.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risk
    Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors
    were to occur, our business, financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
    adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also
    constrain our business and operations.

Our Substantial Leverage Could Adversely Affect Our Ability
    To Raise Additional Capital To Fund Our Operations, Limit
    Our Ability To React To Changes In The Economy Or Our Industry,
    Expose Us To Interest Rate Risk To The Extent Of Our Variable
    Rate Debt And Prevent Us From Meeting Our Obligations.

Since completing the Recapitalization, we are highly leveraged.
    As of December 31, 2007, our total indebtedness was
    $27.308 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have
    important consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry
    conditions;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing
    us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product or service line
    development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general
    corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who are less highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions
    contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the
    indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness
    is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we
    now face could intensify.

Our Debt
    Agreements Contain Restrictions That Limit Our Flexibility In
    Operating Our Business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
    governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that
    limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.
    These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’
    ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;

•

create liens;



•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for
    as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based
    revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving
    credit facility is less than a specified amount, for a certain
    period of time, or if a payment or bankruptcy event of default
    has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our
    depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a
    blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to
    prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and
    to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities we are required to
    satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to
    meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our
    control, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could
    result in a default under both of our senior secured credit
    facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our
    senior secured credit facilities, our lenders could elect to
    declare all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit
    facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
    commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay
    those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit
    facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them
    to secure each such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant
    portion of our assets as collateral under our senior secured
    credit facilities and our existing senior secured notes. If any
    of the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities
    accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no
    assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our
    senior secured credit facilities and our outstanding notes.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other Hospitals And
    Health Care Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition
    among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
    intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
    local communities served by most of our hospitals provide
    services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In 2005, CMS
    began making public performance data related to 10 quality
    measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare
    reimbursement. On February 8, 2006, the federal DRA 2005
    was enacted by Congress to expand and provide for the future
    expansion of the number of quality measures that must be
    reported. For federal fiscal year 2008, CMS requires hospitals
    to report 27 measures of inpatient quality of care to avoid a 2%
    point reduction in their market basket update. For the federal
    fiscal year 2009 payment update, CMS will require hospitals to
    report 30 inpatient quality measures to avoid a 2% point
    reduction in their market basket update. CMS is requiring that
    seven measures of outpatient quality of care be reported during
    federal fiscal year 2008 to receive the full market basket
    update for outpatient services in federal fiscal year 2009. The
    additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical
    transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive
    position and patient volumes. If any of our hospitals achieve
    poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on
    these quality measures, patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals,
    surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the
    geographic areas in which we operate has increased
    significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
    highly competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that
    compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or
    not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable
    contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on
    a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals are facing increasing
    competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and from
    both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for
    market share in high margin services and for quality physicians
    and personnel. Also, we anticipate that the number of
    physician-owned specialty hospitals may increase as HHS has
    ended a moratorium on the Medicare enrollment of such hospitals.
    If ambulatory surgery centers are better able to compete in this
    environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a
    decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in
    margin, even if those patients use our ambulatory surgery
    centers. Further, if our competitors are better able to attract
    patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain
    favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than our
    hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, we may experience an
    overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1,
    “Business — Competition.”



The
    Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A Deterioration
    In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could Adversely Affect
    Our Results Of Operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate
    to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which
    the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by
    the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly
    from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal and state governmental and private employer
    health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient
    admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31,
    2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 89% of the $4.825 billion patient due
    accounts receivable balance. For the year ended
    December 31, 2007, the provision for doubtful accounts
    increased to 11.7% of revenues compared to 10.4% of revenues in
    2006.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
    proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
    accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these
    accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Changes
    In Governmental And Judicial Interpretations May Negatively
    Impact Our Ability To Obtain Reimbursement Of Medicare Bad
    Debts

The Medicare program will reimburse 70% of bad debts related to
    deductibles and coinsurance for patients with Medicare coverage,
    after the provider has made a reasonable effort to collect these
    amounts. On March 30, 2006, the United States District
    Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final order
    in

Battle Creek Health System v. Thompson,

which
    provided that reasonable collection efforts have not been
    satisfied as long as the Medicare accounts remained with an
    external collection agency. On appeal, the United States Court
    of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the lower court’s
    decision. We incur substantial amounts of Medicare bad debts
    every year that could be subjected to the

Battle Creek

decision. We utilize extensive in-house and external collection
    efforts for our accounts receivable, including deductible and
    coinsurance amounts owed by patients with Medicare coverage. We
    utilize a secondary collection agency after in-house and primary
    collection agency efforts have been unsuccessful. As of
    August 1, 2007, we modified our accounts receivable
    collection processes to provide us with reasonable collection
    results and comply with CMS’s interpretation of reasonable
    collection efforts. Possible future changes in judicial and
    administrative interpretations of law and regulations governing
    Medicare could disrupt our collections processes, increase our
    costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

Changes
    In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from
    government health care programs, principally Medicare and
    Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and
    substantial changes. We derived approximately 57% of our
    admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2007. In
    recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted
    in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of
    payments to health care providers for certain services under
    these government programs. Possible future changes in the
    Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs, including Medicaid
    supplemental payments pursuant to upper payment limit programs,
    may impact reimbursements to health care providers and insurers.
    Such changes may also increase our operating costs, which could
    reduce our profitability.

Effective January 1, 2007, as a result of the federal DRA
    2005, reimbursements for ASC overhead costs were limited to no
    more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient
    departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the
    same procedure. On August 2, 2007, CMS issued final
    regulations that changed payments for procedures performed in an
    ASC. Effective January 1, 2008, ASC payment groups
    increased from nine clinically disparate payment groups to an
    extensive list of covered surgical procedures among the APCs
    used under the outpatient PPS for these surgical services. CMS
    estimates that the payment rates for procedures performed in an
    ASC setting equal 65% of the corresponding rates paid for the
    same procedures performed in an outpatient hospital setting.
    Moreover, if CMS determines that a procedure is commonly
    performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement
    for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable
    under the Medicare Part B Physician



Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. In addition, all surgical
    procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk
    or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC
    procedures. This has expanded the number of procedures that
    Medicare pays for if performed in an ASC. Because the new
    payment system has a significant impact on payments for certain
    procedures, the final rule establishes a four-year transition
    period for implementing the revised payment rates. More Medicare
    procedures that are now performed in hospitals, such as ours,
    may be moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals.
    Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in ASCs,
    such as ours, may be moved to physicians’ offices.
    Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies.

On August 22, 2007, CMS issued a final rule for federal
    fiscal year 2008 for hospital inpatient PPS. This rule adopts a
    two-year implementation of MS-DRGs, a severity-adjusted DRG
    system. This change represents a refinement to the existing DRG
    system, and its impact on our revenues has not been significant.
    Realignments in the DRG system could impact the margins we
    receive for certain services. This rule provides for a 3.3%
    market basket update for hospitals that submit certain quality
    patient care indicators and a 1.3% update for hospitals that do
    not submit this data. While we will endeavor to comply with all
    quality data submission requirements, our submissions may not be
    deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market
    basket adjustment for all our hospitals. Medicare payments to
    hospitals in federal fiscal year 2008 will be reduced by 0.6% to
    eliminate what CMS estimates will be the effect of coding or
    classification changes as a result of hospitals implementing the
    MS-DRG system. This “documentation and coding
    adjustment” will increase to 0.9% for federal fiscal year
    2009. However, Congress has given CMS the ability to
    retrospectively determine if the documentation and coding
    adjustment levels for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 were
    adequate to account for changes in payments not related to
    changes in case mix. If the levels are found to have been
    inadequate, CMS can impose an adjustment to payments for federal
    fiscal years 2010, 2011 and 2012. This evaluation of changes in
    case-mix based on actual claims data may yield a higher
    documentation and coding adjustment thereby potentially reducing
    our revenues and impacting our results of operations in ways
    that cannot be quantified at this time. Additionally, Medicare
    payments to hospitals are subject to a number of other
    adjustments, and the actual impact on payments to specific
    hospitals may vary. In some cases, commercial third-party payers
    and other payers such as some state Medicaid programs rely on
    all or portions of the Medicare DRG system to determine payment
    rates. The change from traditional Medicare DRGs to MS-DRGs
    could adversely impact those payment rates if any other payers
    adopt MS-DRGs.

Since states must operate with balanced budgets and since the
    Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DRA 2005
    includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over
    five years. On May 29, 2007, CMS published a final rule
    entitled “Medicaid Program; Cost Limit for Providers
    Operated by Units of Government and Provisions to Ensure the
    Integrity of Federal-State Financial Partnership.” A
    moratorium was placed on this rule, delaying its implementation
    until 2008. However, when the moratorium expires, this final
    rule could significantly impact state Medicaid programs. In its
    proposed form, this rule was expected to reduce federal Medicaid
    funding by $12.2 billion over five years. As a result of
    the moratorium on implementing the final rule, the impact of the
    final rule has not been quantified. States have also adopted, or
    are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and
    program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care
    programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems. Future legislation or other
    changes in the administration or interpretation of government
    health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

Demands
    Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely Affect Our Growth In
    Revenues.

Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment
    payers, including managed care plans, significantly affects the
    revenues and operating results of most of our hospitals.
    Admissions derived from managed care and other insurers
    accounted for approximately 37% of our admissions in 2007.
    Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers,
    increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures, and the
    trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to
    increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Reductions
    in price increases or the amounts received from managed care,
    commercial insurance or other payers could have a material,
    adverse effect on our financial position and results of
    operations.



If We Are
    Unable To Retain And Negotiate Favorable Contracts With Managed
    Care Plans, Our Revenues May Be Reduced.

Our ability to obtain favorable contracts with health
    maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and
    other managed care plans significantly affects the revenues and
    operating results of our facilities. Revenues derived from these
    entities and other insurers accounted for 53% of our patient
    revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.
    Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to
    retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new
    managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. Other health
    care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care
    contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other
    favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our
    competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed
    care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care
    companies to contract with us. If we are unable to retain and
    negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans, our
    revenues may be reduced.

Our
    Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain Quality
    Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions,
    and the success of our hospitals depends, therefore, in part on
    the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs
    of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians
    and maintaining good relations with those physicians. Physicians
    are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they
    practice and, in many of the markets that we serve, most
    physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in
    addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their
    affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to
    provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced
    equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those
    physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to
    our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating
    performance may decline.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May Increase
    Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and
    experience of our management and medical support personnel, such
    as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our
    physicians. We compete with other health care providers in
    recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
    personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
    hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
    professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
    other medical support personnel has become a significant
    operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to
    continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain
    nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more
    expensive temporary or contract personnel. We also depend on the
    available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in
    each of the markets in which we operate. As the competition
    increases to hire more people from labor pools that are not
    growing at a rate sufficient to meet demand, our labor costs
    could increase. Additionally, to the extent that a significant
    portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize,
    our costs could increase. If our costs increase, we may not be
    able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a
    significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed,
    prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor
    costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain
    qualified management, nurses and other medical support
    personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

If We
    Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government Regulations,
    We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make Significant
    Changes To Our Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
    and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local
    government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing for services;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•

adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;



•

confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with
    health-related information and medical records;

•

the screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who
    have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and certification;

•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

operating policies and procedures; and

•

addition of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law
    and the False Claims Act and similar state laws. These laws
    impact the relationships that we may have with physicians and
    other referral sources. We have a variety of financial
    relationships with physicians and others who either refer or
    influence the referral of patients to our hospitals and other
    health care facilities, including employment contracts, leases
    and professional service agreements. We also have similar
    relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients
    are referred from our facilities. We also provide financial
    incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit
    physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. The OIG
    has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that
    are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
    Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe
    harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint
    ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other
    referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer
    patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to
    qualify for a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement
    necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute, but may subject
    the arrangement to greater scrutiny; however, we cannot assure
    you that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be
    found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of
    violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may also be brought
    under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a
    lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including
    the Anti-kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their
    immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by
    meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships
    to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
    implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we
    cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the
    Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an
    exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the
    Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark
    Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found
    to violate the False Claims Act, either under a suit brought by
    the government or by a private person under a

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suit.

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
    Law, the False Claims Act or other applicable laws and
    regulations, or if we fail to maintain an effective corporate
    compliance program, we could be subjected to liabilities,
    including civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to
    operate one or more facilities), exclusion of one or more
    facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and
    other federal and state health care programs and, for violations
    of certain laws and regulations, criminal penalties. See
    Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other
    Factors.”

Because many of these laws and their implementation regulations
    are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of
    significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
    and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
    enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our
    current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
    illegality or could require us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure
    programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have
    violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are
    being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could
    have a material, adverse effect our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business
    reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other
    legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be
    adopted that adversely affect our business.

CMS has announced its intent to require 500 hospitals to respond
    to the DFRR and thereby disclose certain financial relationships
    between such hospitals and physicians. The timing and format of
    the DFRR are not yet



known. HHS has indicated it intends to use the DFRR to monitor
    compliance with the Stark Law, and HHS may share the information
    with other government agencies. CMS has indicated that
    responding hospitals will have a limited amount of time to
    compile a significant amount of information relating to their
    financial relationships with physicians. Depending on the final
    format of the DFRR, responding hospitals may be subject to
    substantial penalties as a result of enforcement actions brought
    by government agencies and whistleblowers acting pursuant to the
    False Claims Act and similar state laws, based on such
    allegations as failure to respond within required deadlines,
    that the response is inaccurate or contains incomplete
    information, or that the response indicates a potential
    violation of the Stark Law or other requirements. Any such
    investigation, enforcement action, or whistleblower allegation
    could materially adversely affect the results of our operations.

We Have
    Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations, Claims And
    Litigation

Commencing in 1997, we became aware that we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
    series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
    we entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement
    (“CIA”) with the OIG. Under the CIA, we have numerous
    affirmative obligations, including the requirement that we
    report potential violations of applicable federal health care
    laws and regulations and have, pursuant to this obligation,
    reported a number of potential violations of the Stark Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, the Emergency Medical Treatment and
    Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) and other laws, most of
    which we consider to be nonviolations or technical violations.
    The government could determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues have been inadequate. If we are
    found to be in violation of the CIA or any applicable health
    care laws or regulations, we could be subject to repayment
    requirements, substantial monetary fines, civil penalties,
    exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and
    other federal and state health care programs, and, for
    violations of certain laws and regulations, criminal penalties.
    Any such sanctions or expenses could have a material, adverse
    effect on our financial position, results of operations or
    liquidity.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal False
    Claims Act, private parties have the right to bring

qui
    tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies
    that submit false claims for payments to the government. Some
    states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims
    provisions. Companies doing business under federal health care
    programs may be contacted by various governmental agencies in
    connection with a government investigation either brought by the
    government or by a private person under a

qui tam

action.
    Because of the confidential nature of some government
    investigations or a confidential seal under the federal False
    Claims Act, we do not always know the particulars of the
    allegations or concerns at the time the government notifies us
    that an investigation is proceeding. Certain of our individual
    facilities have received, and other facilities may receive,
    government inquiries from federal and state agencies. Depending
    on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries
    or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution
    could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare
    Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers,
    as well as the OIG, conduct audits of our health care
    operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
    audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.
    Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and
    whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the
    resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Controls
    Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our
    Revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to
    reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
    “utilization review,” have affected and are expected
    to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails
    the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient
    by health plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay
    and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by
    payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review
    and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
    health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
    Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to
    continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these
    changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the
    scope of services reimbursed and on



reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse
    effect on our business, financial position and results of
    operations.

Our
    Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our Information
    Systems.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or
    delay the collection of revenue. Even though we have implemented
    network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to
    computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from
    unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of these events
    could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of
    data, or cessations in the availability of systems, all of which
    could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position
    and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

The performance of our sophisticated information technology and
    systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to
    our shared services initiatives, our information systems are
    essential to a number of critical areas of our operations,
    including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management; and

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts
    and supply contracts.

State
    Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of Health Care
    Facilities Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our
    Operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country,
    require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as
    a certificate of need, for the purchase, construction or
    expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital
    expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In
    giving approval, these states consider the need for additional
    or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently
    operate health care facilities in a number of states with
    certificate of need laws. The failure to obtain any requested
    certificate of need could impair our ability to operate or
    expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely
    affect our ability to attract patients to our facilities and
    grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas, Which
    Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental And
    Competitive Conditions And Changes In Those States.

We operated 169 hospitals at December 31, 2007, and 72 of
    those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida
    and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented
    approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2007. This concentration makes us
    particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental
    and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any
    material change in the current payment programs or regulatory,
    economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those
    states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall
    business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida and Texas and other areas
    across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In
    the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the
    operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal
    states, and the patient populations in those states. Our
    business activities could be harmed by a particularly active
    hurricane season or even a single storm. In addition, the
    premiums to renew our property insurance policy for 2006 and
    2007 increased significantly over premiums incurred in 2005. Our
    current policy also includes an increase in the stated
    deductible and we were not able to obtain coverage in the
    amounts we have had under our policies prior to 2006. As a
    result of such increases in deductibles, we expect that our cash
    flows and



profitability may be adversely affected. In addition, the
    property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses
    from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.

We are currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
    Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) certain claimed
    deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection
    with its examination of the 2001 and 2002 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and 15 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). We expect the IRS will complete its
    examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns for
    HCA and 19 affiliated partnerships during the first quarter of
    2008 and intend to contest certain claimed deficiencies and
    adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection with these audits
    before the IRS Appeals Division.

The disputed items pending before the IRS Appeals Division for
    2001 and 2002, or proposed by the IRS Examination Division for
    2003 and 2004, include the deductibility of a portion of the
    2001 and 2003 government settlement payments, the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2001 through
    2004, the method for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful
    accounts in 2002 through 2004, and the amount of insurance
    expense deducted in 2001 and 2002.

The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns for HCA during the first quarter of 2008. We expect the
    IRS will open examinations of the 2005 and 2006 federal income
    tax for returns for one or more affiliated partnerships during
    2008.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against Our
    Facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices,
    including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
    ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
    liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims
    and significant defense costs. We insure a substantial portion
    of our professional liability risks through a wholly-owned
    subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured
    retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover claims
    arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance
    contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance
    contracts are included in its reserves for professional
    liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
    that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
    reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially
    determined estimates, are not covered by insurance or
    reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results
    of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

We Are
    Exposed To Market Risks Related To Changes In The Market Values
    Of Securities And Interest Rate Changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.870 billion and $29 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair
    value of investments is generally based on quoted market prices.
    At December 31, 2007, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $21 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be affected by the
    inability to access capital markets. At December 31, 2007,
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, had invested
    $725 million in municipal, tax-exempt student loan auction
    rate securities and $20 million in preferred stock auction
    rate securities which were classified as long-term investments.
    The auction rate securities (“ARS”) are publicly
    issued securities with long-term stated maturities for which the
    interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction every 35 to
    92 days. The auctions have historically provided a liquid
    market for these securities, as investors could readily sell
    their investments at auction. With the liquidity issues
    experienced in global credit and capital markets, the ARS held
    by our wholly-owned subsidiary have experienced multiple failed
    auctions, beginning on February 11, 2008, as the amount of
    securities



submitted for sale exceeded the amount of purchase orders. There
    is a very limited market for the ARS at this time. We do not
    currently intend to attempt sell the ARS as the liquidity needs
    of our insurance subsidiary are expected to be met by other
    investments in its investment portfolio. If uncertainties in the
    credit and capital markets continue or there are ratings
    downgrades on the ARS held by our insurance subsidiary, we may
    be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on
    these long-term investments in future periods.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates and periodically enter into interest rate swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our
    interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
    variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on
    common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The net
    interest payments based on the notional amounts in these
    agreements generally match the timing of the cash flows of the
    related liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
    represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
    and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
    opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
    the opposite market impact on the related debt. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Since The
    Recapitalization, The Investors Control Us And May Have
    Conflicts Of Interest With Us In The Future.

As of December 31, 2007, the Investors indirectly own 97.5%
    of our capital stock due to the Recapitalization. As a result,
    the Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any
    significant corporate transaction and have the ability to
    prevent any transaction that requires the approval of
    shareholders. For example, the Investors could cause us to make
    acquisitions that increase the amount of our indebtedness or
    sell assets.

Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making
    investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
    businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or
    more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities
    that may be complementary to our business and, as a result,
    those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So
    long as investment funds associated with or designated by the
    Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the
    outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is
    less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly
    influence or effectively control our decisions.

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we
    directly or indirectly operate 108 freestanding surgery centers.
    We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with
    some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
    occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately
    1,147,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
    area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain
    regional service centers related to our shared services
    initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
    which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
    suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
    for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various
    federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating
    their operation. Management does not believe that compliance
    with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our
    financial position or results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position in a given period.

Government
    Investigations, Claims and Litigation

In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
    Services. Violation or breach of the CIA, or violation of
    federal or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar
    programs, could subject us to substantial monetary fines, civil
    and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs.



Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or through
    private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed against us as
    a result of such actions could have a material, adverse effect
    on our results of operations or financial position.

Shareholder
    Derivative Lawsuits in Federal Court

In November 2005, two then current shareholders each filed a
    derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of HCA, in the United
    States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee
    against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and
    Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief
    Financial Officer, other executives, and certain members of our
    Board of Directors. Each lawsuit asserted claims for breaches of
    fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of
    corporate assets, and unjust enrichment in connection with our
    July 13, 2005 announcement of preliminary results of
    operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 and seeks
    monetary damages.

On January 23, 2006, the Court consolidated these actions
    as

In re HCA Inc. Derivative Litigation

, case number
    3:05-CV-0968. The court stayed this action on February 27,
    2006, pending resolution of a motion to dismiss the consolidated
    amended complaint in the related federal securities class action
    against us. On March 24, 2006, a consolidated derivative
    complaint was filed pursuant to a prior court order. These cases
    have now been settled.

Shareholder
    Derivative Lawsuit in State Court

On January 18, 2006, a then current shareholder filed a
    derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of HCA, in the Circuit
    Court for the State of Tennessee (Nashville District), against
    our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief
    Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
    Officer, other executives, and certain members of our Board of
    Directors. This lawsuit was substantially identical in all
    material respects to the consolidated federal litigation
    described above under “Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits in
    Federal Court.” The Court stayed this action on
    April 3, 2006, pending resolution of a motion to dismiss
    the consolidated amended complaint in the related federal
    securities class action against us. This case has now been
    settled.

ERISA
    Litigation

On November 22, 2005, Brenda Thurman, a former employee of
    an HCA affiliate, filed a complaint in the United States
    District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of
    herself, the HCA Savings and Retirement Program (the
    “Plan”), and a class of participants in the Plan who
    held an interest in our common stock, against our Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer,
    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other
    unnamed individuals. The lawsuit, filed under
    sections 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C.
    §§ 1132(a)(2) and (3), alleges that defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Plan and to plan
    participants and seeks monetary damages and injunctions and
    other relief.

On January 13, 2006, the court signed an order staying all
    proceedings and discovery in this matter, pending resolution of
    a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in the
    related federal securities class action against HCA. On
    January 18, 2006, the magistrate judge signed an order
    (1) consolidating Thurman’s cause of action with all
    other future actions making the same claims and arising out of
    the same operative facts, (2) appointing Thurman as lead
    plaintiff, and (3) appointing Thurman’s attorneys as
    lead counsel and liaison counsel in the case. On
    January 26, 2006, the court issued an order reassigning the
    case to United States District Court Judge William J.
    Haynes, Jr., who was presiding over the federal securities
    class action and federal derivative lawsuits. We have reached an
    agreement in principle to settle this suit, subject to court
    approval.

Merger
    Litigation in State Court

We are aware of six asserted class action lawsuits related to
    the Merger filed against us, our Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer, our President and Chief Operating Officer, members of
    the Board of Directors and each of the Sponsors in the Chancery
    Court for Davidson County, Tennessee. The complaints are
    substantially similar and allege, among other things, that the
    Merger was the product of a flawed process, that the
    consideration to be paid to our shareholders in the Merger was
    unfair and inadequate, and that there was a breach of fiduciary
    duties. The complaints further allege that the Sponsors abetted
    the actions of our officers and directors in breaching their



fiduciary duties to our shareholders. The complaints sought,
    among other relief, an injunction preventing completion of the
    Merger. On August 3, 2006, the Chancery Court consolidated
    these actions and all later-filed actions as

In re HCA Inc.
    Shareholder Litigation

, case number

06-1816-III.

On November 8, 2006, we and the other named parties entered
    into a memorandum of understanding with plaintiffs’ counsel
    in connection with these actions. These cases have now been
    settled.

Two cases making similar allegations and seeking similar relief
    on behalf of purported classes of then current shareholders have
    also been filed in Delaware. These two actions have also been
    consolidated under case number 2307-N and are pending in the
    Delaware Chancery Court, New Castle County. These cases have
    been dismissed in light of the settlement of the related
    Tennessee cases.

On October 23, 2006, the Foundation for Seacoast Health
    filed a lawsuit against us and one of our affiliates, HCA Health
    Services of New Hampshire, Inc., in the Superior Court of
    Rockingham County, New Hampshire. Among other things, the
    complaint seeks to enforce certain provisions of an asset
    purchase agreement between the parties, including a purported
    right of first refusal to purchase a New Hampshire hospital,
    that allegedly were triggered by the Merger and other prior
    events. The Foundation initially sought to enjoin the Merger.
    However, the parties reached an agreement that allowed the
    Merger to proceed, while preserving the plaintiff’s
    opportunity to litigate whether the Merger triggered the right
    of first refusal to purchase the hospital and, if so, at what
    price the hospital could be repurchased. On May 25, 2007,
    the court granted HCA’s motion for summary judgment
    disposing of the Foundation’s central claims. The
    Foundation has filed an appeal from the final judgment.

General
    Liability and Other Claims

On April 10, 2006, a class action complaint was filed
    against us in the District Court of Kansas alleging, among other
    matters, nurse understaffing at all of our hospitals, certain
    consumer protection act violations, negligence and unjust
    enrichment. The complaint is seeking, among other relief,
    declaratory relief and monetary damages, including disgorgement
    of profits of $12.250 billion. A motion to dismiss this
    action was granted on July 27, 2006, but the plaintiffs
    have appealed this dismissal. We believe this lawsuit is without
    merit and plan to defend it vigorously.

We are a party to certain proceedings relating to claims for
    income taxes and related interest in the United States Tax Court
    and the United States Court of Federal Claims. For a description
    of those proceedings, see Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — IRS Disputes” and Note 6 to our
    consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
    physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
    the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which
    may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management,
    the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
    proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

On December 31, 2007, Hercules Holding II, LLC, the holder
    of 97.5% of our issued and outstanding shares of capital stock,
    reelected Christopher J. Birosak,
    George A. Bitar, Jack O. Bovender,
    Jr., Richard M. Bracken,
    John P. Connaughton, Thomas F. Frist,
    Jr., Thomas F. Frist III, Christopher 
    R. Gordon, Michael W. Michelson,
    James C. Momtazee, Stephen G. Pagliuca,
    Peter M. Stavros and Nathan C. Thorne, as
    the Board of Directors of the Company through a written consent
    of stockholders to action without a meeting. On January 29,
    2008, a notice of such action was sent to the holders of record
    of our issued and outstanding capital stock as of the close of
    business on December 31, 2007.



PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our outstanding common stock is privately held, and there is no
    established public trading market for our common stock. As of
    February 29, 2008, there were 637 holders of our common
    stock. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Financing Activities” for a
    description of the restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.

In January 2006, our Board of Directors approved an increase in
    our quarterly dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.17 per share.
    The Board declared the initial $0.17 per share dividend payable
    on June 1, 2006 to shareholders of record at May 1,
    2006 and an additional dividend payable September 1, 2006
    to shareholders of record on August 1, 2006. We did not pay
    a quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of 2006. We did
    not pay any dividends in 2007.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, HCA issued
    15,814 shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of
    stock options for aggregate consideration of $201,629.  The
    shares were issued without registration in reliance on the
    exemptions afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and
    Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
    CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements present certain information with respect to
    the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
    HCA Inc. which should be read in conjunction with the following
    discussion and analysis. The terms “HCA,”
    “Company,” “we,” “our,” or
    “us,” as used herein, refer to HCA Inc. and our
    affiliates unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. The
    term “affiliates” means direct and indirect
    subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in
    which such subsidiaries are partners.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

includes certain disclosures which contain “forward-looking
    statements.” Forward-looking statements include all
    statements that do not relate solely to historical or current
    facts, and can be identified by the use of words like
    “may,” “believe,” “will,”
    “expect,” “project,” “estimate,”
    “anticipate,” “plan,” “initiative”
    or “continue.” These forward-looking statements are
    based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a
    number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, many of
    which are beyond our control, that could significantly affect
    current plans and expectations and our future financial position
    and results of operations. These factors include, but are not
    limited to, (1) the ability to recognize the benefits of
    the Recapitalization, (2) the impact of the substantial
    indebtedness incurred to finance the Recapitalization,
    (3) increases in the amount and risk of collectibility of
    uninsured accounts and deductibles and copayment amounts for
    insured accounts, (4) the ability to achieve operating and
    financial targets, and attain expected levels of patient volumes
    and control the costs of providing services, (5) possible
    changes in the Medicare, Medicaid and other state programs,
    including Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to upper
    payment limit (“UPL”) programs, that may impact
    reimbursements to health care providers and insurers,
    (6) the highly competitive nature of the health care
    business, (7) changes in revenue mix and the ability to
    enter into and renew managed care provider agreements on
    acceptable terms, (8) the efforts of insurers, health care
    providers and others to contain health care costs, (9) the
    outcome of our continuing efforts to monitor, maintain and
    comply with appropriate laws, regulations, policies and
    procedures and the CIA, (10) changes in federal, state or
    local laws or regulations affecting the health care industry,
    (11) increases in wages and the ability to attract and
    retain qualified management and personnel, including affiliated
    physicians, nurses and medical and technical support personnel,
    (12) the possible enactment of federal or state health care
    reform, (13) the availability and terms of capital to fund
    the expansion of our business and improvements to our existing
    facilities, (14) changes in accounting practices,
    (15) changes in general economic conditions nationally and
    regionally in our markets, (16) future divestitures which
    may result in charges, (17) changes in business strategy or
    development plans, (18) delays in receiving payments for
    services provided, (19) the outcome of pending and any
    future tax audits, appeals and litigation associated with our
    tax positions, (20) potential liabilities and other claims
    that may be asserted against us, and (21) other risk
    factors described in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

As a consequence, current plans, anticipated actions and future
    financial position and results of operations may differ from
    those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on
    behalf of HCA. You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such
    forward-looking statements when evaluating the information
    presented in this report.

    1.1% during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to
    the year ended December 31, 2006.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the provision for
    doubtful accounts increased to 11.7% of revenues from 10.4% of
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006. Same
    facility uninsured admissions increased 9.4% and same facility
    uninsured emergency room visits increased 7.3% for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006.

Interest expense totaled $2.215 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to $955 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. The $1.260 billion
    increase in interest expense for 2007 was due primarily to the
    significant increase in debt related to the November 2006
    Recapitalization.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

Maintain Our Dedication to the Care and Improvement of Human
    Life.

Our business is built on putting patients
    first and providing high quality health care services in the
    communities we serve. Our dedicated professionals oversee our
    Quality Review System, which measures clinical outcomes,
    satisfaction and regulatory compliance to improve hospital
    quality and performance. In addition, we continue to implement
    advanced health information technology to improve the quality
    and convenience of services to our communities. We are using our
    advanced electronic medication administration record, which uses
    bar coding technology to ensure that each patient receives the
    right medication, to build toward a fully electronic health
    record that will provide convenient access, electronic order
    entry and decision support for physicians. These technologies
    improve patient safety, quality and efficiency.

Maintain Our Commitment to Ethics and
    Compliance.

We are committed to a corporate
    culture highlighted by the following values —
    compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness, loyalty, respect and
    kindness. Our comprehensive ethics and compliance program
    reinforces our dedication to these values.

Leverage Our Leading Local Market
    Positions.

We strive to maintain and enhance the
    leading positions that we enjoy in the majority of our markets.
    We believe that the broad geographic presence of our facilities
    across a range of markets, in combination with the breadth and
    quality of services provided by our facilities, increases our
    attractiveness to patients and large employers and positions us
    to negotiate more favorable terms from commercial payers and
    increase the number of payers with whom we contract. We also
    intend to strategically enhance our outpatient presence in our
    communities to attract more patients to our facilities.

Expand Our Presence in Key Markets.

We seek to
    grow our business in key markets, focusing on large, high growth
    urban and suburban communities, primarily in the southern and
    western regions of the United States. We seek to strategically
    invest in new and expanded services at our existing hospitals
    and surgery centers to increase our revenues at those facilities
    and provide the benefits of medical technology advances to our
    communities. We intend to continue to expand high volume and
    high margin specialty services, such as cardiology and
    orthopedic services, and increase the capacity, scope and
    convenience of our outpatient facilities. To complement this
    intrinsic growth, we intend to continue to opportunistically
    develop and acquire new hospitals and outpatient facilities.

Business
    Strategy (Continued)

Continue to Leverage Our Scale.

We will
    continue to obtain price efficiencies through our group
    purchasing organization and build on the cost savings and
    efficiencies in billing, collection and other processes we have
    achieved through our regional service centers. We are
    increasingly taking advantage of our national scale by
    contracting for services on a multistate basis. We will explore
    the feasibility of replicating our successful shared services
    model for additional clinical and support functions, such as
    physician credentialing, medical transcription and electronic
    medical recordkeeping, across multiple markets.

Continue to Develop Enduring Physician
    Relationships.

We depend on the quality and
    dedication of the physicians who serve at our facilities, and we
    aggressively recruit both primary care physicians and key
    specialists to meet community needs and improve our market
    position. We strategically recruit physicians and often assist
    them in establishing a practice or joining an existing practice
    where there is a community need and provide support to build
    their practices in compliance with regulatory standards. We
    intend to improve both service levels and revenues in our
    markets by:

•

expanding the number of high quality specialty services, such as
    cardiology, orthopedics, oncology and neonatology;

•

continuing to use joint ventures with physicians to further
    develop our outpatient business, particularly through ambulatory
    surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers;

•

developing medical office buildings to provide convenient
    facilities for physicians to locate their practices and serve
    their patients; and

•

continuing our focus on improving hospital quality and
    performance and implementing advanced technologies in our
    facilities to attract physicians to our facilities.

Become the Health Care Employer of Choice.

We
    will continue to use a number of industry-leading practices to
    help ensure our hospitals are a health care employer of choice
    in their respective communities. Our staffing initiatives for
    both care providers and hospital management provide strategies
    for recruitment, compensation and productivity to increase
    employee retention and operating efficiency at our hospitals.
    For example, we maintain an internal contract nursing agency to
    supply our hospitals with high quality staffing at a lower cost
    than external agencies. In addition, we have developed several
    proprietary training and career development programs for our
    physicians and hospital administrators, including an executive
    development program designed to train the next generation of
    hospital leadership. We believe our continued investment in the
    training and retention of employees improves the quality of
    care, enhances operational efficiency and fosters employee
    loyalty.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and various other assumptions we believe are
    reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on
    an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related
    disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes
    known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
    are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
    Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
    plans are based upon the

Revenues

payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
    Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The
    estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific
    basis and are recorded based on the best information available
    regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable
    laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually
    reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and
    incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent
    changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from
    contract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested
    significant resources to refine and improve our computerized
    billing systems and the information system data used to make
    contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized
    calculation processes and related training programs to improve
    the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals
    for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the
    federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
    federal poverty level is established by the federal government
    and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts
    from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify
    for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
    those provided to many local managed care plans.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and
    documentation of health care services authorized and provided,
    the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement
    are often subject to interpretations that could result in
    payments that are different from our estimates. A hypothetical
    1% change in net receivables that are subject to contractual
    discounts at December 31, 2007 would result in an impact on
    pretax earnings of approximately $34 million.

Provision
    for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
    care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
    primary source of cash and is critical to our operating
    performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured
    patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the
    primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
    applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all
    uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts.
    Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and
    external collection efforts have been performed. Prior to August
    2007, we considered the return of an account from the primary
    external collection agency to be the culmination of our
    reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing
    off the account balance. During August 2007, we modified our
    collection policies to establish a review of all accounts, upon
    completion of our internal collection efforts, against certain
    standard collection criteria. Upon the completion of this review
    process, accounts determined to possess positive collectibility
    attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collection
    agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that
    are not collected by the secondary external collection agency
    are written off when they are returned to us by the collection
    agency

(usually within 18 to 24 months). Our August 2007
    collection policy change results in a delay in writing off the
    accounts forwarded to the secondary external collection agency
    compared to our previous policy and we expect to incur increases
    in both our gross accounts receivable and the allowance for
    doubtful accounts due to this delay in recording writeoffs.
    Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the
    writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the
    patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of
    amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify
    as charity care. Charity care is not reported in revenues and
    does not have an impact on the provision for doubtful accounts.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
    coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on
    the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and
    recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
    revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
    analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating
    the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
    hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
    accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At
    December 31, 2007, the allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 89% of the $4.825 billion patient
    due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of the
    related estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid assistance or charity was being
    evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). At
    December 31, 2006, the allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 86% of the $3.972 billion patient
    due accounts receivable balance, including pending Medicaid
    accounts, net of the related estimated contractual discounts.
    Days revenues in accounts receivable were 53 days,
    53 days and 50 days at December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the
    challenges related to the collection of the patient due
    accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients
    having adequate health care coverage, general economic
    conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer
    mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health
    care coverage could affect the collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payer
    classification as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 is set
    forth in the following table:

Professional
    Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in
    an environment with professional liability risks. Prior to 2007,
    a substantial portion of our professional liability risks was
    insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves
    for professional liability risks were $1.513 billion and
    $1.584 billion at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively. The current portion of
    these reserves, $280 million and $275 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by
    reinsurance contracts are included in the reserves for
    professional liability risks, as the insurance subsidiary
    remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of
    $44 million and $42 million receivable under
    reinsurance contracts at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively) were $1.469 billion and $1.542 billion
    at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Reserves and
    provisions for professional liability risks are based upon
    actuarially determined estimates. The independent
    actuaries’ estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts
    receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.224 billion
    to $1.471 billion at December 31, 2007 and
    $1.321 billion to $1.545 billion at December 31,
    2006. Reserves for professional liability risks represent the
    estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses
    incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet
    dates. The reserves are estimated using individual case-basis
    valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject
    to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The
    estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded
    as experience develops or new information becomes known.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,600 and 3,000 individual claims at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. The estimation of the
    timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Changes
    to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current
    operating results. Due to the considerable variability that is
    inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that the
    ultimate liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks
    were $163 million, $217 million and $298 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The declining provision for losses trend reflects
    the recognition by the external actuaries of our improving
    frequency and severity claim trends. This improving frequency
    and moderating severity can be primarily attributed to tort
    reforms enacted in key states, particularly Texas, and our risk
    management and patient safety initiatives, particularly in the
    area of obstetrics.

Income
    Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary
    differences that arise from the recognition of items in
    different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax
    assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed
    in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed
    in future periods.

Although we believe that we have properly reported taxable
    income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws,
    federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge
    our tax positions upon audit. We account for uncertain tax
    positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”.
    Accordingly, we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
    from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
    our income tax return. Final audit results may vary from our
    estimates.

rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect
    what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have
    entered into agreements with third-party payers, including
    government programs and managed care health plans, under which
    the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing
    services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem
    rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue
    collection of amounts related to patients who meet our
    guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not
    reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients
    who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care that are similar
    to the discounts provided to many local managed care plans.

Revenues increased 5.4% to $26.858 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 from $25.477 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 and increased 4.2% for the
    year ended December 31, 2006 from $24.455 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in revenues
    in 2007 can be primarily attributed to an 8.3% increase in
    revenue per equivalent admission, offsetting a 2.7% decline in
    equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The increase
    in revenues in 2006 can be primarily attributed to a 6.8%
    increase in revenue per equivalent admission offsetting a 2.4%
    decline in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.

Same facility admissions decreased 1.3% in 2007 compared to 2006
    and increased 0.2% in 2006 compared to 2005. Same facility
    inpatient surgeries decreased 1.0% and same facility outpatient
    surgeries decreased 1.1% during 2007 compared to 2006. Same
    facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.7% and same facility
    outpatient surgeries decreased 1.2% during 2006 compared to

    2007 compared to 2006 and decreased 0.8% during 2006 compared to
    2005.

Admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid, managed care and other insurers and the
    uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and

    current trends of increasing same facility uninsured emergency
    room visits and same facility uninsured admissions to continue
    during 2008.

Several factors negatively affected patient volumes in 2007 and
    2006. More stringent enforcement of case management guidelines
    led to certain patient services being classified as outpatient
    observation visits instead of

one-day

admissions. Unit closures and changes in Medicare admission
    guidelines led to reductions in rehabilitation and skilled
    nursing admissions. Cardiac admissions have been affected by
    competition from physician-owned heart hospitals. To increase

    increase available medical office

Prior to 2006, managed Medicare revenues were classified as

At December 31, 2007, we owned and operated 37 hospitals
    and 34 surgery centers in the state of Florida. Our Florida
    facilities’ revenues totaled $6.732 billion and
    $6.563 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007, we owned and
    operated 35 hospitals and 22 surgery centers in the state of
    Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled
    $6.911 billion and $6.316 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2007 and
    2006, 55% and 54%, respectively, of our admissions and 51% of
    our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities.
    Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 62% and
    59% of our uninsured admissions during 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

We provided $1.530 billion, $1.296 billion and
    $1.138 billion of charity care (amounts are based upon our
    gross charges) during the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. We provide discounts to uninsured
    patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These
    discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed
    care plans and totaled $1.474 billion, $1.095 billion
    and $769 million for the years ended December 31,
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government
    health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are
    highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial
    changes. During 2007 and 2006, we have increased the indigent
    care services we provide in several communities in the state of
    Texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. The state of Texas
    has been involved in the effort to increase the indigent care
    provided by private hospitals. As a result of this additional
    indigent care provided by private hospitals, public hospital
    districts or counties in Texas have available funds that were
    previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital
    districts or counties are under no contractual or legal
    obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital
    districts or counties have elected to offer some portion of
    these amounts of newly available

ad valorem

tax revenues
    as a state portion of the Medicaid program (which is funded by
    both state and federal dollars). Such action is at the sole
    discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is
    anticipated that the state contributions will be matched with
    federal Medicaid funds. The state then may make Medicaid
    supplemental payments to hospitals in the state, including those
    that are providing additional indigent care services. Such
    payments must be within the federal UPL established by federal
    regulation.

Our Texas Medicaid revenues increased by $232 million and
    $39 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to
    increases in Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to UPL
    programs in which we, local governments and other unaffiliated
    providers participate.

Based upon review of certain expenditures claimed for federal
    Medicaid matching funds by the state of Texas, CMS recently
    deferred a portion of claimed amounts. The federal deferral is
    expected to continue until CMS completes its review. The outcome
    of such review might affect the past and future claimed
    payments. We have not recognized any net benefits related to the
    Texas Medicaid supplemental payments in our operating results
    for periods subsequent to June 30, 2007 and will continue
    this revenue recognition policy until we receive further
    guidance from responsible federal and state agencies. We expect
    to receive updated information from the responsible federal and
    state agencies during the second and third quarters of 2008.

Results
    of Operations (Continued)

Years
    Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Net income totaled $874 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to $1.036 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Financial results for 2007
    include gains on sales of facilities of $471 million, gains
    on investments of $8 million and an asset impairment charge
    of $24 million. Financial results for 2006 include gains on
    sales of facilities of $205 million, gains on investments
    of $243 million, expenses related to the Recapitalization
    of $442 million and an asset impairment charge of
    $24 million.

Revenues increased 5.4% to $26.858 billion for 2007 from
    $25.477 billion for 2006. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to an 8.3% increase in revenue per equivalent
    admission, offsetting a 2.7% decline in equivalent admissions
    compared to the prior year. Same facility revenues increased
    7.4% due to an 8.1% increase in same facility revenue per
    equivalent admission, offsetting a 0.7% decrease in same
    facility equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.

During 2007, same facility admissions decreased 1.3%, compared
    to 2006. Inpatient surgical volumes decreased 3.1% on a
    consolidated basis and same facility inpatient surgeries
    decreased 1.0% during 2007 compared to 2006. Outpatient surgical
    volumes decreased 2.0% on a consolidated basis and same facility
    outpatient surgeries decreased 1.1% during 2007 compared to 2006.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 39.9%
    in 2007 and 40.9% in 2006. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 5.8% in 2007 compared to 2006. Labor rate
    increases averaged 5.0% for 2007 compared to 2006.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.4% in 2007 and
    17.0% in 2006. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    4.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Same facility supply costs
    increased 6.4% for medical devices, primarily for orthopedic
    supplies, 13.1% for blood products, and 5.6% for general medical
    and surgical items.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased
    to 15.7% in 2007 from 16.0% in 2006. Other operating expenses
    are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome
    taxes. Other operating expenses include $187 million and
    $11 million of indigent care costs in certain Texas markets
    during 2007 and 2006, respectively. Provisions for losses
    related to professional liability risks were $163 million
    and $217 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    reduction in the provision for professional liability risks
    reflects the recognition by our external actuaries of improving
    frequency and severity claim trends at our facilities.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of revenues,
    increased to 11.7% for 2007 from 10.4% in 2006. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from
    patients. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts,
    as a percentage of revenues, can be attributed to an increasing
    amount of patient financial responsibility under certain managed
    care plans and same facility increases in uninsured emergency
    room visits of 7.3% and uninsured admissions of 9.4% in 2007
    compared to 2006. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for
    doubtful accounts represented approximately 89% of the
    $4.825 billion total patient due accounts receivable
    balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual
    discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for
    Medicaid coverage was being evaluated.

Gains on investments for 2007 and 2006 of $8 million and
    $243 million, respectively, relate to sales of investment
    securities by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Net
    unrealized gains on investment securities declined from
    $25 million at December 31, 2006 to $21 million
    at December 31, 2007. The decrease in realized gains for
    2007 was primarily due to the decision to liquidate our equity
    investment portfolio and reinvest in debt and interest-bearing
    investments during the fourth quarter of 2006. We expect
    realized gains, if any, during 2008 to be more comparable to the
    2007 amounts rather than the 2006 amounts.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (Continued)

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $197 million for 2006 to $206 million for 2007. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenue, to 5.4% in 2007 from 5.5% in 2006. Purchases of
    property and equipment of $1.444 billion during 2007 were
    generally equivalent to depreciation expense for 2007 of
    $1.421 billion.

Interest expense increased to $2.215 billion for 2007 from
    $955 million for 2006. The increase in interest expense is
    primarily due to the increased debt related to the
    Recapitalization. Our average debt balance was
    $27.732 billion for 2007 compared to $13.811 billion
    for 2006. The average interest rate for our long-term debt
    decreased from 7.9% at December 31, 2006 to 7.6% at
    December 31, 2007.

Gains on sales of facilities were $471 million for 2007 and
    included a $312 million gain on the sale of our two
    Switzerland hospitals and a $131 million gain on the sale
    of a facility in Florida. Gains on sales of facilities were
    $205 million for 2006 and included a $92 million gain
    on the sale of four hospitals in West Virginia and Virginia and
    a $93 million gain on the sale of two hospitals in Florida.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
    increased from $201 million for 2006 to $208 million
    for 2007. The increase relates primarily to the operations of
    surgery centers and other outpatient services entities.

The effective tax rate was 26.6% for 2007 and 37.6% for 2006.
    Based on new information received in 2007 related primarily to
    tax positions taken in prior taxable periods, we reduced our
    provision for income taxes by $85 million. During 2007, we
    also recorded reductions to the provision for income taxes of
    $39 million to adjust 2006 state tax accruals to the
    amounts recorded on completed tax returns and based upon an
    analysis of the Recapitalization costs. Excluding the effect of
    these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2007 would have
    been 37.0%.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

Net income totaled $1.036 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to $1.424 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2005. Financial results for 2006
    include gains on investments of $243 million, gains on
    sales of facilities of $205 million, reductions to
    estimated professional liability reserves of $136 million,
    expenses related to the Recapitalization of $442 million
    and an asset impairment charge of $24 million. Financial
    results for 2005 include gains on investments of
    $53 million, gains on sales of facilities of
    $78 million, reductions to estimated professional liability
    reserves of $83 million, an adverse financial impact from
    hurricanes of $60 million, a tax benefit of
    $24 million related to the repatriation of foreign
    earnings, and a favorable tax settlement of $48 million
    related to the divestitures in 1998 and 2001 of certain noncore
    business units.

Revenues increased 4.2% to $25.477 billion for 2006 from
    $24.455 billion 2005. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to a 6.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission
    offsetting a 2.4% decline in equivalent admissions compared to
    the prior year. Same facility revenues increased 6.2% due to a
    6.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission
    and flat same facility equivalent admissions for 2006 compared
    to 2005.

During 2006, same facility admissions increased 0.2%, compared
    to 2005. Same facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.7% and
    same facility outpatient surgeries decreased 1.2% during 2006
    compared to 2005.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.9%
    in 2006 and 40.6% in 2005. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 7.4% in 2006 compared to 2005. Labor rate
    increases averaged approximately 5.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006 compared to 2005.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 17.0% in 2006 and
    16.9% in 2005. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    7.4% in 2006 compared to 2005. Same facility supply costs
    increased 11.0% for medical devices (cardiology and orthopedic)
    and 2.6% for pharmacy products.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased
    to 16.0% in 2006 from 16.5% in 2005. Other operating expenses in
    2006 reflect reductions to our estimated professional liability
    reserves of $136 million, compared to $83 million in
    reductions recorded in 2005. Other operating expenses are
    primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of revenues,
    increased to 10.4% for 2006 from 9.6% in 2005. The provision for
    doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
    primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients. The
    increase in the provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
    of revenues, can be attributed to an increasing amount of
    patient financial responsibility under certain managed care
    plans and same facility increases in uninsured emergency room
    visits of 6.2% and uninsured admissions of 10.9% in 2006
    compared to 2005. At December 31, 2006, our allowance for
    doubtful accounts represented approximately 86% of the
    $3.972 billion total patient due accounts receivable
    balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual
    discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for
    Medicaid coverage was being evaluated.

Gains on investments for 2006 of $243 million relate to
    sales of investment securities by our wholly-owned insurance
    subsidiary. Gains on investments for 2005 were $53 million.
    Net unrealized gains on investment securities declined from
    $184 million at December 31, 2005 to $25 million
    at December 31, 2006. The increase in realized gains and
    the decline in unrealized gains were primarily due to the
    decision to liquidate our equity investment portfolio and
    reinvest in debt and interest-bearing investments.

Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased from
    $221 million for 2005 to $197 million for 2006. The
    decrease was primarily due to decreases in profits at the
    Denver, Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenue, to 5.5% in 2006 from 5.6% in 2005. During 2005, we
    incurred additional depreciation expense of approximately
    $44 million to correct accumulated depreciation of certain
    facilities and assure a consistent application of our accounting
    policy relative to certain short-lived medical equipment.

Interest expense increased to $955 million for 2006 from
    $655 million for 2005. While interest expense increased
    $300 million for 2006 compared to 2005, $207 million
    of the increase occurred during the fourth quarter of 2006 due
    to the increased debt related to the Recapitalization. Our
    average debt balance was $13.811 billion for 2006 compared
    to $9.828 billion for 2005. The average interest rate for
    our long-term debt increased from 7.0% at December 31, 2005
    to 7.9% at December 31, 2006.

Gains on sales of facilities were $205 million for 2006 and
    included a $92 million gain on the sale of four hospitals
    in West Virginia and Virginia and a $93 million gain on the
    sale of two hospitals in Florida. Gains on sales were facilities
    were $78 million for 2005 and included a $29 million
    gain related to the recognition of previously deferred gain on
    the sale of a group of medical office buildings.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
    increased from $178 million for 2005 to $201 million
    for 2006. The increase relates primarily to the operations of
    surgery centers and other outpatient services entities.

The effective tax rate was 37.6% for 2006 and 33.9% for 2005.
    During 2005, the effective tax rate was reduced due to a
    favorable tax settlement of $48 million related to the
    divestiture of certain noncore business units and a tax

benefit of $24 million from the repatriation of foreign
    earnings. Excluding the effect of the combined $72 million
    tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2005 would have been
    37.3%.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our main cash requirements are the servicing of our debt,
    capital expenditures on our existing properties and acquisitions
    of hospitals and other health care entities. Our primary cash
    sources are cash flow from operating activities, issuances of
    debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and
    other health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $1.396 billion in 2007 compared to $1.845 billion in
    2006 and $2.971 billion in 2005. Working capital totaled
    $2.356 billion at December 31, 2007 and
    $2.502 billion at December 31, 2006. The lower cash
    provided by operating activities in 2007 when compared to both
    2006 and 2005 relates, primarily, to increases in interest
    payments of $1.270 billion for 2007 compared to 2006 and
    $1.539 billion for 2007 compared to 2005, and decreases in
    net income tax payments of $666 million for 2007 compared
    to 2006 and $142 million for 2007 compared to 2005. The net
    impact of the cash payments for interest and income taxes was an
    increase in cash payments of $604 million for 2007 compared
    to 2006 and an increase of $1.397 billion for 2007 compared
    to 2005.

Cash used in investing activities was $479 million,
    $1.307 billion and $1.681 billion in 2007, 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
    were $1.444 billion in 2007, $1.865 billion in 2006
    and $1.592 billion in 2005. We expended $32 million,
    $112 million and $126 million for acquisitions of
    hospitals and health care entities during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions in all three years
    were generally comprised of outpatient and ancillary services
    entities and were funded by a combination of cash flows from
    operations and the issuance or incurrence of debt. Planned
    capital expenditures are expected to approximate
    $1.8 billion in 2008. At December 31, 2007, there were
    projects under construction which had an estimated additional
    cost to complete and equip over the next five years of
    $1.9 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures
    with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2007, we sold three hospitals for cash proceeds of
    $661 million, and we also received cash proceeds of
    $106 million related primarily to the sales of real estate
    investments. The sales of nine hospitals were completed during
    2006 for cash proceeds of $560 million, and we also
    received cash proceeds of $91 million on the sales of real
    estate investments and our equity investment in a hospital joint
    venture. During 2005, we received cash proceeds of
    $260 million from the sales of five hospitals and
    $60 million of cash proceeds related primarily to the sales
    of real estate investments.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.158 billion in
    2007, $240 million in 2006 and $1.212 billion in 2005.
    During 2007, we used the cash proceeds from sales of facilities
    and available cash provided by operations to make debt
    repayments of $1.270 billion. The 2006 Recapitalization
    included the issuance of $19.964 billion of long-term debt,
    the receipt of $3.782 billion of equity contributions, the
    repurchase of $20.364 billion of common stock, the payment
    of $745 million for Recapitalization related fees and
    expenses, and the retirement of $3.182 billion of existing
    long-term debt.

During 2007, we received $100 million of cash from
    issuances of our common stock. During 2006, we repurchased
    13.1 million shares (excluding the Recapitalization) of our
    common stock for a total of $653 million. During 2005, we
    repurchased 36.7 million shares of our common stock for a
    total cost of $1.856 billion, and we received cash inflows
    of $943 million related to the exercise of employee stock
    options.

    and Capital Resources (Continued)

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
    capital include amounts available under our senior secured
    credit facilities ($2.507 billion as of December 31,
    2007 and $2.692 billion as of February 29,
    2008) and anticipated access to public and private debt
    markets.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiary,
    to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
    $1.899 billion and $2.143 billion at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance
    recoveries, during the next twelve months are expected to
    approximate $230 million. Our wholly-owned insurance
    subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and
    the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts are
    included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as
    the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers
    do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts.
    To minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies,
    we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and
    monitor concentrations of credit risk arising from similar
    activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers. The
    amounts receivable related to the reinsurance contracts were
    $44 million and $42 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively.

Financing
    Activities

Due to the Recapitalization, we are a highly leveraged company
    with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled
    $27.308 billion and $28.408 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our interest
    expense increased from $955 million for 2006 to
    $2.215 billion for 2007.

In connection with the Recapitalization, we entered into
    (i) a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based
    revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of 85% of
    eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and
    eligibility criteria ($650 million available at
    December 31, 2007) (the “ABL credit facility”)
    and (ii) a senior secured credit agreement (the “cash
    flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit
    facility, the “senior secured credit facilities”),
    consisting of a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.857 billion available at December 31, 2007 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($2.638 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2007), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    ($8.712 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2007) and a €1.000 billion European term loan
    (€663 million, or $967 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2007).

Also in connection with the Recapitalization, we issued
    $4.200 billion of senior secured notes (comprised of
    $1.000 billion of


/


% notes
    due 2014 and $3.200 billion of


/


% notes
    due 2016) and $1.500 billion of


/


% senior
    secured toggle notes (which allow us, at our option, to pay
    interest in kind during the first five years) due 2016, which
    are subject to certain standard covenants.

Proceeds from the senior secured credit facilities and the
    senior secured notes were used in connection with the closing of
    the Recapitalization. Amounts owned under our previous bank
    credit agreements were repaid at the close of the
    Recapitalization. In connection with the Recapitalization, we
    also tendered for all amounts outstanding under the
    8.85% notes due 2007, the 7.00% notes due 2007, the
    7.25% notes due 2008, the 5.25% notes due 2008 and the
    5.50% notes due 2009 (collectively, the “Notes”).
    Approximately 97% of the $1.365 billion total outstanding
    amount under the Notes was repurchased pursuant to the tender.

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all
    existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material
    domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted
    Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated as of
    December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose
    subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under
    our ABL credit facility). In addition, borrowings under the
    European term loan are guaranteed by all material, wholly-owned
    European subsidiaries.

In consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in
    which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in
    private practice for the benefit of the respective communities,
    we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one
    year, to assist in establishing the physicians’ practices.
    The actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often
    depends upon the financial results of the physicians’
    private practices during the recruitment agreement payment
    period. The physician commitments reflected were based on our
    maximum exposure on effective agreements at December 31,
    2007.

(g)

We have entered into guarantee agreements related to certain
    leases.

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.870 billion and $29 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2007. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair
    value of investments is generally based on quoted market prices.
    At December 31, 2007, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $21 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash to pay
    claims and other expenses on short notice in excess of normal
    cash requirements, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a
    price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a
    normal market environment. At December 31, 2007, our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, had invested
    $725 million in municipal, tax-exempt student loan auction
    rate securities and $20 million in preferred stock auction
    rate securities which were classified as long-term investments.
    The auction rate securities (“ARS”) are publicly
    issued securities with long-term stated maturities for which the
    interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction every 35 to
    92 days. The auctions have historically provided a liquid
    market for these securities as investors could readily sell
    their investments at auction. With the liquidity issues
    experienced in global credit and capital markets, the ARS held
    by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary have experienced
    multiple failed auctions, beginning on February 11, 2008,
    as the amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the
    amount of purchase orders. There is a very limited market for
    the ARS at this time. We do not currently intend to attempt sell
    the ARS as the liquidity needs of our insurance subsidiary are
    expected to be met by other investments in its investment
    portfolio. If uncertainties in the credit and capital markets
    continue or there are ratings downgrades on the ARS held by our
    insurance subsidiary, we may be required to recognize
    other-than-temporary impairments on these long-term investments
    in future periods.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates and we periodically enter into interest rate swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our
    interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
    variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on
    common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have
    been recognized in the financial statements at their respective
    fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
    included in other comprehensive income.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately
    $5.673 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2007
    is subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining
    balance in long-term debt of $21.635 billion at
    December 31, 2007 is subject to fixed rates of interest.
    Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior
    secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable
    interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities.
    Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities

bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at
    our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference
    to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus


/


of 1% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or
    (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the
    relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings
    under the senior secured credit facilities, with the exception
    of term loan B where the margin is static, may be reduced
    subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. The average rate
    for our long-term debt decreased from 7.9% at December 31,
    2006 to 7.6% at December 31, 2007. On February 16,
    2007, we amended the cash flow credit facility to reduce the
    applicable margins with respect to the term borrowings
    thereunder. On June 20, 2007, we amended the ABL credit
    facility to reduce the applicable margin with respect to
    borrowings thereunder.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was
    $26.127 billion at December 31, 2007. The estimates of
    fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.
    Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the
    potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would
    be approximately $57 million. To mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of
    our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

Our international operations and the European term loan expose
    us to market risks associated with foreign currencies. In order
    to mitigate the currency exposure related to debt service
    obligations through December 31, 2011 under the European
    term loan, we have entered into cross currency swap agreements.
    A cross currency swap is an agreement between two parties to
    exchange a stream of principal and interest payments in one
    currency for a stream of principal and interest payments in
    another currency over a specified period.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they
    are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
    subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
    the hedged items when they occur. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a
    hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the
    remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Effects
    of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
    certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
    for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare
    patients are established under the federal government’s
    prospective payment system. Total

fee-for-service

Medicare revenues approximated 24% in 2007, 26% in 2006 and 27%
    in 2005 of our total patient revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry operating margins
    have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure
    because of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses
    in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the
    Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
    regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain
    operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare
    patients is limited.

IRS
    Disputes

We are currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
    Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) certain claimed
    deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection
    with its examination of the 2001 and 2002 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and 15 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). We expect the IRS will complete its
    examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns for
    HCA and 19 affiliated partnerships during the first quarter of
    2008 and intend to contest certain claimed deficiencies and
    adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection with these audits
    before the IRS Appeals Division.

The disputed items pending before the IRS Appeals Division for
    2001 and 2002, or proposed by the IRS Examination Division for
    2003 and 2004, include the deductibility of a portion of the
    2001 and 2003 government settlement payments, the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2001 through
    2004, the method for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful
    accounts in 2002 through 2004, and the amount of insurance
    expense deducted in 2001 and 2002.

Thirty-two taxable periods of HCA, its predecessors,
    subsidiaries and affiliated partnerships ended in 1987 through
    2000, for which the primary remaining issue is the computation
    of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are pending before
    the IRS Examination Division or the United States Tax Court as
    of December 31, 2007.

The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns for HCA during the first quarter of 2008. We expect the
    IRS will open examinations of the 2005 and 2006 federal income
    tax returns for one or more affiliated partnerships during 2008.

Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded
    to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. Management
    believes that HCA, its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates
    properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance
    with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and
    that final resolution of these disputes will not have a
    material, adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position. However, if payments due upon final
    resolution of these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such
    resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position.

    disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
    under

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this
    evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
    financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this annual report.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
    term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2007.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered
    public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this

Form 10-K,

has issued a report on our internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included herein.



(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited HCA Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). HCA Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2007, and our report dated March 26, 2008 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

Other
    Information

2008-2009
    Senior Officer Performance Excellence Program.

On March 26, 2008, the Compensation Committee and Board of
    the Company adopted the

2008-2009

Senior Officer Performance Excellence Program (the “Senior
    Officer PEP”). Under the Senior Officer PEP, the executive
    officers of the Company shall be eligible to earn performance
    awards based upon the achievement of certain



specified performance targets. The specified performance
    criteria for the Company’s Named Executive Officers (as
    defined in the Senior Officer PEP) is EBITDA (as defined in the
    Senior Officer PEP). The performance criteria for other
    participants are based on EBITDA and specified individual
    performance goals. Target awards for the Named Executive
    Officers are as follows: 126% in 2008 and 132% in 2009 of base
    salary for the Chairman and CEO; 96% in 2008 and 102% in 2009 of
    base salary for the President and COO; and 66% in 2008 and 72%
    in 2009 of base salary for the Executive Vice President and CFO
    and the Group Presidents.

Target awards for senior officers other than the Named Executive
    Officers are 36% to 56% of base salary, as determined by the
    Committee. The Committee shall adjust these levels and
    percentages for 2009 in its sole discretion. Participants will
    receive 100% of the target award for target performance, 50% of
    the target award for a minimum acceptable (threshold) level of
    performance, and a maximum of 200% of the target award for
    maximum performance.

The minimum (threshold), target and maximum performance levels
    shall be set by the Committee in its sole discretion. No
    payments will be made for performance below specified threshold
    amounts. Payouts between threshold and maximum will be
    calculated by the Committee in its sole discretion using
    interpolation. The Committee may make adjustments to the terms
    of awards under the Senior Officer PEP in recognition of unusual
    or nonrecurring events affecting a participant or the Company,
    or the financial statements of the Company, or in certain other
    instances specified in the Senior Officer PEP.

With respect to 2009, the Committee may supplement the measures
    and weightings set forth in the Senior Officer PEP with various
    Company, operating unit, business segment or division financial
    performance measures as described in the Senior Officer PEP.

The foregoing description of the Senior Officer PEP does not
    purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
    reference to the Senior Officer PEP, a copy of which is attached
    to this report as Exhibit 10.27 and is incorporated herein by
    reference. The Company has separate performance excellence
    programs for its employees who are not senior officers.

Audit
    Committee Financial Expert

Our Audit and Compliance Committee is composed of Christopher J.
    Birosak, Thomas F. Frist III, Christopher R. Gordon and James C.
    Momtazee. In light of our status as a closely held company and
    the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our
    Board has not designated any member of the Audit and Compliance
    Committee as an “audit committee financial expert.”
    Though not formally considered by our Board given that our
    securities are not registered or traded on any national
    securities exchange, based upon the listing standards of the New
    York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), the national
    securities exchange upon which our common stock was listed prior
    to the Merger, we do not believe that any of
    Messrs. Birosak, Frist, Gordon or Momtazee would be
    considered independent because of their relationships with
    certain affiliates of the funds and other entities which hold
    significant interests in Hercules Holding, which owns 97.5% of
    our outstanding common stock, and other relationships with us.
    See Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions.”

Code of
    Ethics

We have a Code of Conduct which is applicable to all our
    directors, officers and employees (the “Code of
    Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is available on the Ethics
    and Compliance and Corporate Governance pages of our website at
    www.hcahealthcare.com. To the extent required pursuant to
    applicable SEC regulations, we intend to post amendments to or
    waivers from our Code of Conduct (to the extent applicable to
    our chief executive officer, principal financial officer or
    principal accounting officer) at this location on our website or
    report the same on a Current Report on

Form 8-K.

Our Code of Conduct is available free of charge upon request to

Item 11.

Executive
    Compensation

Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis

The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the
    Board of Directors is generally charged with the oversight of
    our executive compensation and rewards programs. The Committee
    is currently composed of Michael W. Michelson, George A. Bitar,
    John P. Connaughton and Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D.
    Responsibilities of the Committee include the review and
    approval of the following items:

•

Executive compensation strategy and philosophy;

•

Compensation arrangements for executive management;



•

Design and administration of the annual cash-based Senior
    Officer Performance Excellence Program (“PEP”);

•

Design and administration of our equity incentive plans;

•

Executive benefits and perquisites (including the HCA
    Restoration Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement
    Plan); and

•

Any other executive compensation or benefits related items
    deemed noteworthy by the Committee.

In addition, the Committee considers the proper alignment of
    executive pay policies with Company values and strategy by
    overseeing employee compensation policies, corporate performance
    measurement and assessment, and Chief Executive Officer
    performance assessment. The Committee may retain the services of
    independent outside consultants, as it deems appropriate, to
    assist in the strategic review of programs and arrangements
    relating to executive compensation and performance.

The following executive compensation discussion and analysis
    describes the principles underlying our executive compensation
    policies and decisions as well as the material elements of
    compensation for our named executive officers. Our named
    executive officers for 2007 were:

•

Jack O. Bovender, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief
    Executive Officer;

•

Richard M. Bracken, President and Chief Operating Officer;

•

R. Milton Johnson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
    Officer;

•

Samuel N. Hazen, President — Western Group; and

•

Beverly B. Wallace, President — Shared Services Group

As discussed in more detail below, substantially all of the
    named executive officers’ compensation for 2007 was
    negotiated and determined in connection with the Merger.

Compensation
    Philosophy and Objectives

The core philosophy of our executive compensation program is to
    support the Company’s primary objective of providing the
    highest quality health care to our patients while enhancing the
    long term value of the Company to our shareholders.
    Specifically, the Committee believes the most effective
    executive compensation program (for all executives, including
    named executive officers):

•

Reinforces HCA’s strategic imperatives;

•

Aligns the economic interests of our executives with those of
    our shareholders; and

•

Encourages attraction and long term retention of key
    contributors.

The Committee is committed to a strong, positive link between
    our objectives and our compensation and benefits practices.

Our compensation philosophy also allows for flexibility in
    establishing executive compensation based on an evaluation of
    information prepared by management or other advisors and other
    subjective and objective considerations deemed appropriate by
    the Committee. This flexibility is important to ensure our
    compensation programs are competitive and that our compensation
    decisions appropriately reflect the unique contributions and
    characteristics of our executives.



Compensation
    Structure and Benchmarking

Our compensation program is heavily weighted towards
    performance-based compensation, reflecting our philosophy of
    increasing the long-term value of the Company and supporting
    strategic imperatives. Total direct compensation and other
    benefits in 2007 consisted of the following elements:

Total Direct Compensation

• Base Salary

• Annual Cash-Based Incentives (offered through our
    PEP)

• Long-Term Equity Incentives (in the form of Stock
    Options)

Other Benefits

• Retirement Plans

• Limited Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits

• Severance Benefits

The Committee does not support rigid adherence to benchmarks or
    compensatory formulas and strives to make compensation decisions
    which effectively support our compensation objectives and
    reflect the unique attributes of the Company and each executive.
    Our general practice, however, with respect to pay positioning
    is that executive base salaries and annual incentive (PEP)
    target value should generally position total annual cash
    compensation between the median and 75th percentile of
    similarly-sized general industry companies. We utilize the
    general industry as our primary source for competitive pay
    levels because HCA is significantly larger than its industry
    peers. See benchmarking discussion below for further
    information. Mr. Bovender’s total annual cash
    compensation for 2007 approximated the competitive median, and
    Mr. Johnson’s total annual cash compensation was slightly
    less than the median, while the other named executive
    officers’ pay fell within the range noted above for jobs
    that are compared to the market.

Cash compensation is currently more weighted towards salary
    rather than PEP than competitive practice among our general
    industry peers would suggest. Over time, we intend to continue
    moving towards a mix of cash compensation that will place a
    greater emphasis on annual performance-based compensation.

Although we look at competitive long-term equity incentive award
    values in similarly-sized general industry companies when
    assessing the competitiveness of our compensation programs, we
    did not base our 2007 stock option grants on these levels since
    equity is structured differently in closely held companies than
    in publicly-traded companies. As is typical in similar
    situations, the Investors wanted to share a certain percentage
    of the equity with executives shortly after the consummation of
    the Merger to establish performance objectives and incentives up
    front in lieu of annual grants to ensure our executive’s
    long-term economic interests would be aligned with those of the
    Investors. This pool of equity was then further allocated based
    on the executive’s anticipated impact on, and potential
    for, driving Company strategy and performance. The resulting
    total direct pay mix is heavily weighted towards
    performance-based pay (PEP plus stock options) rather than fixed
    pay, which the Committee believes reflects the compensation
    philosophy and objectives discussed above.

Compensation
    Process

While our 2007 named executive officer compensation was largely
    determined at the time of the Merger, the Committee ensures that
    executives’ pay levels are generally consistent with the
    compensation strategy described above, in part, by conducting
    annual assessments of competitive executive compensation.
    Management (but no named executive officer), in collaboration
    with the Committee’s independent consultant, Semler Brossy
    Consulting Group, LLC, collects and presents compensation data
    from similarly-sized general industry companies, based to the
    extent possible on comparable position matches and compensation
    components. The following nationally recognized survey sources
    were utilized in anticipation of establishing 2008 executive
    compensation:

Number of

Companies in

Survey

Revenue Scope (Median Revenue)

Sample

Towers Perrin

Greater than $20B ($35B)


Hewitt Associates

$10B - $25B ($14.0B)


Hewitt Associates

Greater than $25B ($46.9B)


Pearl Meyer

$20B - $30B ($25.4B)




These particular revenue scopes were selected because they were
    the closest approximations to HCA’s revenue size. Each
    survey that provided an appropriate position match and
    sufficient sample size to be used as a benchmark was weighted
    equally. For this purpose, the two Hewitt Associates surveys
    were considered as one survey, and we used a weighted average of
    the two surveys (65% for the $10B — $25B cut and 35%
    for the Greater than $25B).

Data was also collected from health care providers within our
    industry including Community Health Systems, Inc., Health
    Management Associates, Inc., Kindred Healthcare, Inc., LifePoint
    Hospitals, Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corporation, Triad Hospitals,
    Inc. (acquired by Community Health Systems, Inc. in July
    2007) and Universal Health Services, Inc. These health care
    providers are used only as a secondary point of reference for
    industry practices since we are significantly larger than these
    companies. The data from this analysis did not affect named
    executive officer pay level decisions in 2007.

Consistent with our flexible compensation philosophy, the
    Committee is not required to approve compensation precisely
    reflecting the results of these surveys applied to our general
    benchmarks, and may also consider, among other factors
    (typically not reflected in these surveys): the requirements of
    the applicable employment agreements, the executive’s
    individual performance during the year, his or her projected
    role and responsibilities for the coming year, his or her actual
    and potential impact on the successful execution of Company
    strategy, recommendations from our chief executive officer and
    compensation consultants, an officer’s prior compensation,
    experience, and professional status, internal pay equity
    considerations, and employment market conditions and
    compensation practices within our peer group. The weighting of
    these and other relevant factors is determined on a

case-by-case

basis for each executive upon consideration of the relevant
    facts and circumstances.

Employment
    Agreements

It has been our past practice not to enter into employment
    agreements with any executive. However, in connection with the
    Merger, we entered into employment agreements with each of our
    named executive officers and certain other members of senior
    management to help ensure the retention of those executives
    critical to the future success of the Company. Among other
    things, these agreements set the executive’s compensation
    terms, their rights upon a termination of employment, and
    restrictive covenants around non-competition, non-solicitation,
    and confidentiality. These terms and conditions are further
    explained in the remaining portion of this Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis and under “Narrative Disclosure to
    Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Employment Agreements.”

Elements
    of Compensation

Base
    Salary

Base salaries are intended to provide reasonable and competitive
    fixed compensation for regular job duties. The threshold base
    salaries for our executives are set forth in their employment
    agreements. Given the employment agreements were executed in
    November 2006, we did not increase named executive officer base
    salaries in 2007. In light of our goal of decreasing the
    emphasis of base salary in our cash compensation mix, we do not
    intend to provide salary increases to any of our named executive
    officers in 2008, other than an approximate 5.3% increase in
    Mr. Johnson’s base salary in order to better align his
    salary with market for his position based on general industry
    surveys.

Annual
    Incentive Compensation: PEP

The PEP is intended to reward named executive officers for
    annual financial performance, with the goals of providing high
    quality health care for our patients and increasing shareholder
    value. Each named executive officer in the PEP is assigned an
    annual award target expressed as a percentage of salary ranging
    from 60% to 120% (see individual targets in table below). These
    targets are intended to provide a meaningful incentive for
    executives to achieve or exceed performance goals. They were set
    in 2007 based on the requirements of the applicable employment
    agreements.

The 2007 PEP was designed to provide 100% of the target award
    for target performance, 50% of the target award for a minimum
    acceptable (threshold) level of performance, and a maximum of
    200% of the target award for



maximum performance, while no payments are made for performance
    below threshold levels. The Committee believes this payout curve
    is consistent with competitive practice. More importantly, it
    promotes and rewards continuous growth as performance goals have
    consistently been set at increasingly higher levels each year.
    Actual awards under the PEP are generally determined using the
    following two steps:

1. The executive’s conduct must reflect our Mission
    and Values by upholding our Code of Conduct and following our
    compliance policies and procedures. This step is critical to
    reinforcing our commitment to integrity and the delivery of high
    quality health care. In the event the Committee determines the
    participant’s conduct during the fiscal year is not in
    compliance with the first step, he or she will not be eligible
    for an incentive award.

2. The actual award amount is determined based upon Company
    performance. In 2007, the PEP for all named executive officers,
    other than Mr. Hazen, incorporated one Company financial
    performance measure, Earnings before Interest, Taxes,
    Depreciation and Amortization (and excluding share-based
    compensation costs under SFAS 123(R)), or
    “EBITDA.” The Company EBITDA target for 2007 was
    $4.457 billion ($4.533 billion after adjustment) for
    the named executive officers. Mr. Hazen’s PEP, as the
    Western Group President was based 50% on Company EBITDA and 50%
    on Western Group EBITDA (with a Western Group EBITDA target for
    2007 of $2.196 billion) to ensure his accountability for
    his group’s results. The Committee chose to base annual
    incentives on EBITDA for a number of reasons:

•

It effectively measures overall Company performance;

•

It is an important surrogate for cash flow, a critical metric
    related to paying down the Company’s significant debt
    obligation;

•

It is the key metric driving the valuation in the internal
    Company model, consistent with the valuation approach used by
    industry analysts; and

•

It is consistent with the metric used for the vesting of the
    financial performance portion of our option grants.

SFAS 123(R) costs are excluded from the calculation because
    like depreciation and amortization, which are also excluded from
    EBITDA, they do not represent a current cash cost. These EBITDA
    targets should not be understood as management’s
    predictions of future performance or other guidance and
    investors should not apply these in any other context. Our 2007
    threshold and maximum goals were set at approximately +/- 3.6%
    of the target goal to reflect likely performance volatility.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2007 PEP and the named executive
    officer employment agreements, the Committee exercised its
    ability to make adjustments to the Company’s 2007 EBITDA
    performance target for dispositions of facilities and accounting
    changes occurring during the 2007 fiscal year.

While the named executive officers’ 2007 PEP targets were
    set in their applicable employment agreements, the Committee
    intends to set 2008 target performance goals based on realistic,
    though slightly aggressive, expectations of Company performance
    ensuring successful execution of our plans in order to realize
    the most value from these awards. While we do not intend to
    disclose our 2008 PEP EBITDA target as an understanding of that
    target is not necessary for a fair understanding of the named
    executive officers’ compensation for 2007 and could result
    in competitive harm and market confusion, we consistently set
    targets that require an increase in EBITDA year over year to
    promote continuous growth consistent with our business plan.

Upon review of the Company’s 2007 financial performance,
    the Committee determined that Company EBITDA performance for the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 exceeded the 2007
    maximum performance goal, as adjusted; therefore, pursuant to
    the terms of the 2007 PEP, awards for the named executive
    officers were paid out at the maximum level, with the exception
    of Mr. Hazen, whose award was paid out at 175.6% of his
    target amount, due to the 50% of his PEP based on the Western
    Group EBITDA, which exceeded the target but did not reach the
    maximum performance level (such amounts are included in the
    “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column



of the Summary Compensation Table). Accordingly, the 2007 PEP
    paid out as follows to the named executive officers:

For purposes of 2008 compensation, in consultation with Semler
    Brossy Consulting Group, the Committee re-evaluated the PEP
    structure including the use of EBITDA as the sole performance
    metric and the payout curve. We determined that the current
    structure continues to achieve our compensation objectives for
    our named executive officers, and therefore, with the exception
    of increasing PEP target opportunities by approximately 6% in
    lieu of salary increases, consistent with our goal to further
    emphasize performance-based pay, we generally intend to leave
    the program structure unchanged for the named executive officers.

Long-Term
    Equity Incentive Awards: Options

In connection with the Merger, the Board of Directors approved
    and adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of
    HCA Inc. and its Affiliates (the “2006 Plan”). The
    purpose of the 2006 Plan is to:

•

Promote our long term financial interests and growth by
    attracting and retaining management and other personnel and key
    service providers with the training, experience and ability to
    enable them to make a substantial contribution to the success of
    our business;

•

Motivate management personnel by means of growth-related
    incentives to achieve long range goals; and

•

Further the alignment of interests of participants with those of
    our shareholders through opportunities for increased stock or
    stock-based ownership in the Company.

In January 2007, pursuant to the terms of the named executive
    officers’ respective employment agreements, the Committee
    approved long-term stock option grants to our named executive
    officers under the 2006 Plan consisting solely of a one-time
    stock option grant in lieu of annual long-term equity incentive
    award grants (“New Options”). In addition to the New
    Options granted in 2007, the Company committed to grant the
    named executive officers 2x Time Options in their
    respective employment agreements, as described in more detail
    below under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation
    Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table —
    Employment Agreements.” The Committee believes that stock
    options are the most effective long-term vehicle to directly
    align the interests of executives with those of our shareholders
    by motivating performance that results in the long-term
    appreciation of the Company’s value, since they only
    provide value to the executive if the value of the Company
    increases. As is typical in leveraged buyout situations, the
    Committee determined that granting all of the stock options
    (except the 2x Time Options) up front rather than annually was
    appropriate to aid in retaining key leaders critical to the
    Company’s success over the next several years and, coupled
    with the executives’ personal investments, provide an
    equity incentive and stake in the Company that directly aligns
    the long-term economic interests of the executives with those of
    the Investors.

The New Options have a ten year term and are divided so that


/


are time vested options,


/


are EBITDA-based performance vested options and


/


are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors, each as described below. The combination of time,
    performance and investor return based vesting of these awards is
    designed to compensate executives for long term commitment to
    the Company, while motivating sustained increases in our
    financial performance and helping ensure the Sponsors have
    received an appropriate return on their invested capital before
    executives receive significant value from these grants.

The time vested options are granted to aid in retention.
    Consistent with this goal, the time vested options granted in
    2007 vest and become exercisable in equal increments of 20% on
    each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. The time
    vested options have an exercise price equivalent to fair market
    value on the date of grant. Since our common stock is not
    currently traded on a national securities exchange, fair market
    value was determined



reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors after
    consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and other advisors.

The EBITDA-based performance vested options are intended to
    motivate sustained improvement in long-term performance.
    Consistent with this goal, the EBITDA-based performance vested
    options granted in 2007 are eligible to vest and become
    exercisable in equal increments of 20% at the end of fiscal
    years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if certain annual EBITDA
    performance targets are achieved. These EBITDA performance
    targets were established at the time of the Merger and can be
    adjusted by the Board of Directors in consultation with the
    Chief Executive Officer as described below. We chose EBITDA as
    the performance metric since it is a key driver of our valuation
    and for other reasons as described above in the “Annual
    Incentive Compensation: PEP” section of this Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis. Due to the number of events that can
    occur within our industry in any given year that are beyond the
    control of management but may significantly impact our financial
    performance (e.g., health care regulations, industry-wide
    significant fluctuations in volume, etc.), we have incorporated

“catch-up”

vesting provisions. The EBITDA-based performance vested options
    may vest and become exercisable on a “catch up” basis,
    if at the end of any year noted above or at the end of fiscal
    year 2012, the cumulative total EBITDA earned in all prior years
    exceeds the cumulative EBITDA target at the end of such fiscal
    year.

As discussed above, we do not intend to disclose the 2008-2011
    EBITDA performance targets as they reflect competitive,
    sensitive information regarding our budget. However, we
    deliberately set our targets at increasingly higher levels.
    Thus, while designed to be attainable, target performance levels
    for these years require strong, improving performance and
    execution which in our view provides an incentive firmly aligned
    with shareholder interests.

As with the EBITDA targets under our 2007 PEP, pursuant to the
    terms of the 2006 Plan and the Stock Option Agreements governing
    the 2007 grants, the Board of Directors, in consultation with
    our Chief Executive Officer, has the ability to adjust the
    established EBITDA targets for significant events, changes in
    accounting rules and other customary adjustment events. We
    believe these adjustments may be necessary in order to
    effectuate the intents and purposes of our compensation plans
    and to avoid unintended consequences that are inconsistent with
    these intents and purposes. The Board of Directors exercised its
    ability to make adjustments to the Company’s

2007-2011

EBITDA performance targets (including cumulative EBITDA targets)
    for facility dispositions and accounting changes occurring
    during the 2007 fiscal year.

The options that vest based on investment return to the Sponsors
    are intended to align the interests of executives with those of
    our principal shareholders to ensure shareholders receive their
    expected return on their investment before the executives can
    receive their gains on this portion of the option grant. These
    options vest and become exercisable with respect to 10% of the
    common stock subject to such options at the end of fiscal years
    2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return (as
    defined below) is at least equal to two times the price paid to
    shareholders in the Merger (or $102.00), and with respect to an
    additional 10% at the end of fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
    and 2011 if the Investor Return is at least equal to

two-and-a-half

times the price paid to shareholders in the Merger (or $127.50).
    “Investor Return” means, on any of the first five
    anniversaries of the closing date of the Merger, or any date
    thereafter, all cash proceeds actually received by affiliates of
    the Sponsors after the closing date in respect of their common
    stock, including the receipt of any cash dividends or other cash
    distributions (including the fair market value of any
    distribution of common stock by the Sponsors to their limited
    partners), determined on a fully diluted, per share basis. The
    Sponsor investment return options also may become vested and
    exercisable on a “catch up” basis if the relevant
    Investor Return is achieved at any time occurring prior to the
    expiration of such options.

Upon review of the Company’s 2007 financial performance,
    the Committee determined that the Company achieved the 2007
    EBITDA performance target of $4.407 billion
    ($4.420 billion after adjustment) under the New Option
    awards; therefore, pursuant to the terms of the 2007 Stock
    Option Agreements, 20% of each named executive officer’s
    EBITDA-based performance vested options vested as of
    December 31, 2007. Further, 20% of each named executive
    officer’s time vested options vested on the first
    anniversary of their grant date, January 30, 2008. No
    portion of the options that vest based on Investor Return vested
    as of the end of the 2007 fiscal year; however, such options
    remain subject to the “catch up” vesting provisions
    described above.



For additional information concerning the options awarded in
    2007, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

As discussed above, except in the cases of promotions or new
    hires, the Committee does not intend to award additional stock
    options to our named executive officers (other than the 2x Time
    Options the Company committed to grant the named executive
    officers in their respective employment agreements, as described
    in more detail below under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary
    Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Employment Agreements”). Grants made in
    connection with promotions and new hires will be formally
    approved by the Committee. The exercise price of grants made in
    connection with promotions and new hires will be based on the
    quarterly fair market value as determined reasonably and in good
    faith by the Board of Directors after consultation with the
    Chief Executive Officer and other advisors. Any option grants
    approved under the 2006 Plan in 2008 (other than the 2x Time
    Options) will be structured identical to those granted in 2007
    except that the options will vest over a four year period rather
    than a five year period, with the time vested options vesting
    and becoming exercisable in equal increments of 25% on each of
    the first four anniversaries of the grant date, the EBITDA-based
    performance vested options being eligible to vest and become
    exercisable in equal increments of 25% at the end of fiscal
    years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the applicable EBITDA
    performance targets are achieved (with the same “catch
    up” provision as described above), and the options that
    vest based on investment return to the Sponsors vesting and
    becoming exercisable with respect to 12.5% of the common stock
    subject to such options at the end of fiscal years 2008, 2009,
    2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return (as defined above) is at
    least equal to two times the price paid to shareholders in the
    Merger (or $102.00), and with respect to an additional 12.5% at
    the end of fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the
    Investor Return is at least equal to

two-and-a-half

times the price paid to shareholders in the Merger (or $127.50)
    (provided that the investor return options granted in
    2008 may also become vested and exercisable on a
    “catch up” basis if the relevant Investor Return is
    achieved prior to the ninth anniversary of the grant date).

Ownership
    Guidelines

While we have maintained stock ownership guidelines in the past,
    as a non-listed company, we no longer have a policy regarding
    stock ownership guidelines. However, we do believe equity
    ownership aligns our executive officers’ interests with
    those of the Investors. Accordingly, all of our named executive
    officers were required to rollover at least half their
    pre-Merger equity and, therefore, maintain significant stock
    ownership in the Company. See “Security Ownership of
    Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
    Matters.”

Retirement
    Plans

We maintain two qualified retirement plans, the HCA 401(k) Plan
    and the HCA Retirement Plan, to aid in retention and to assist
    employees in providing for their retirement. Generally all
    employees who have completed the required service are eligible
    to participate in these plans. Each of our named executive
    officers participates in both plans. For additional information
    on these plans, including amounts contributed by HCA in 2007 to
    the named executive officers, see the Summary Compensation Table
    and related footnotes and narratives and “Pension
    Benefits.”

Our key executives, including the named executive officers, also
    participate in two supplemental retirement programs. The
    Committee and the Board initially approved these supplemental
    programs to:

•

Recognize significant long-term contributions and commitments by
    executives to the Company and to performance over an extended
    period of time;

•

Induce our executives to continue in our employ through a
    specified normal retirement age (initially 62 through 65, but
    reduced to 60 upon the change in control at the time of the
    Merger in 2006); and

•

Provide a competitive benefit to aid in attracting and retaining
    key executive talent.

The Restoration Plan provides a benefit to replace the lost
    contributions due to the IRS compensation limit under Internal
    Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17). For additional information
    concerning the Restoration Plan, see “Nonqualified Deferred
    Compensation.”



Key executives also participate in the Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan, or the “SERP,” adopted in 2001. The
    SERP benefit brings the total value of annual retirement income
    to a specific income replacement level. For named executive
    officers with 25 years or more of service, this income
    replacement level is 60% of final average pay (base salary and
    PEP payouts) at normal retirement, a competitive level of
    benefit at the time the plan was implemented. Due to the Merger,
    all participants are fully vested in their SERP benefits and the
    plan is now frozen to new entrants. For additional information
    concerning the SERP, see “Pension Benefits.”

In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any payments already made. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.

Personal
    Benefits

Our executive officers receive limited, if any, benefits outside
    of those offered to our other employees. Generally, we provide
    these benefits to increase travel and work efficiencies which
    allows for more productive use of the executive’s time.
    Mr. Bovender and Mr. Bracken are permitted to use the
    Company aircraft for personal trips, subject to the
    aircraft’s availability. Other named executive officers may
    have their spouses accompany them on business trips taken on the
    Company aircraft, subject to seat availability. In addition,
    there are times when it is appropriate for an executive’s
    spouse to attend events related to our business. On those
    occasions, we will pay for the travel expenses of the
    executive’s spouse. We will, on an as needed basis, provide
    mobile telephones and personal digital assistants to our
    employees and certain of our executive officers have obtained
    such devices through us. The value of these personal benefits,
    if any, is included in the executive officer’s income for
    tax purposes and, in certain limited circumstances, the
    additional income attributed to an executive officer as a result
    of one or more of these benefits will be grossed up to cover the
    taxes due on that income. Except as otherwise discussed herein,
    other welfare and employee-benefit programs are the same for all
    of our eligible employees, including our executive officers. For
    additional information, see footnote (6) to the Summary
    Compensation Table.

Severance
    and Change in Control Benefits

As noted above, all of our named executive officers have entered
    into employment agreements in connection with the Merger, which
    provide, among other things, each executive’s rights upon a
    termination of employment in exchange for non-competition,
    non-solicitation, and confidentiality covenants. We believe that
    reasonable severance benefits are appropriate in order to be
    competitive in our executive retention efforts. These benefits
    should reflect the fact that it may be difficult for such
    executives to find comparable employment within a short period
    of time. We also believe that these types of agreements are
    appropriate and customary in situations such as the Merger
    wherein the executives have made significant personal
    investments in the Company and that investment is generally
    illiquid for a significant period of time. Finally, we believe
    formalized severance arrangements are common benefits offered by
    employers competing for similar senior executive talent.

If employment is terminated by the Company without
    “cause” or by the executive for “good
    reason” (whether or not the termination was in connection
    with a

change-in-control),

the executive would be entitled to “accrued rights”
    (Cause, good reason and accrued rights are as defined in
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements”) plus:

•

Subject to restrictive covenants and the signing of a general
    release of claims, an amount equal to two times for
    Mr. Hazen and Ms. Wallace and three times in the case
    of Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, and Johnson the sum of base
    salary plus PEP paid or payable in respect of the fiscal year
    immediately preceding the fiscal year in which termination
    occurs, payable over a two year period;

•

Pro-rata bonus; and

•

Continued coverage under our group health plans during the
    period over which the cash severance is paid.

Additionally, unvested options will be forfeited, except as
    described below for Mr. Bovender.



Because we believe that a termination by the executive for good
    reason (a constructive termination) is conceptually the same as
    an actual termination by the Company without cause, we believe
    it is appropriate to provide severance benefits following such a
    constructive termination of the named executive officer’s
    employment. All of our severance provisions are believed to be
    within the realm of competitive practice and are intended to
    provide fair and reasonable compensation to the executive upon a
    termination event.

In light of his long-term service to the Company, in the event
    Mr. Bovender is terminated for any reason other than Cause
    after he has attained 62 years of age, (A) neither
    Mr. Bovender nor the Company will have any put or call
    rights with respect to his New Options granted following the
    Merger or stock acquired upon exercise of such options (see
    Item 13. “Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions — Stockholder Agreements”),
    (B) the unvested New Options held by Mr. Bovender that
    vest solely based on the passage of time will vest as if his
    employment had continued through the next three anniversaries of
    their date of grant, (C) the unvested New Options held by
    Mr. Bovender that are performance options will remain
    outstanding and will vest, if at all, on the next three dates
    that they would have otherwise vested had his employment
    continued, based upon the extent to which performance goals are
    met, and (D) Mr. Bovender’s New Options will
    remain exercisable until the second anniversary of the last date
    on which his performance based New Options are eligible to vest,
    except that his new options that are granted with an option
    exercise price equal to two times that of his performance based
    options (“2x Time Options”) (the 2x Time Options were
    not granted in 2007) will remain exercisable until the
    fifth anniversary of the last date on which his performance
    based New Options are eligible to vest. Furthermore, we will
    continue to provide coverage for Mr. Bovender and his
    spouse under our group health plan (on the same basis as such
    coverage was provided immediately prior to termination of
    employment) until, in each case, he and his spouse attain
    65 years of age.

Pursuant to the Stock Option Agreements governing the New
    Options granted in 2007 under the 2006 Plan, upon a Change in
    Control of the Company (as defined below), all unvested time
    vesting New Options (that have not otherwise terminated or
    become exercisable) shall become immediately exercisable.
    Performance vesting options that vest subject to the achievement
    of EBITDA targets will become exercisable upon a Change in
    Control of the Company if: (i) prior to the date of the
    occurrence of such event, all EBITDA targets have been achieved
    for years ending prior to such date; (ii) on the date of the
    occurrence of such event, the Company’s actual cumulative
    total EBITDA earned in all years occurring after the performance
    option grant date, and ending on the date of the Change in
    Control, exceeds the cumulative total of all EBITDA targets in
    effect for those same years; or (iii) the Investor Return is at
    least two-and-a-half times the price paid to the shareholders in
    the Merger (or $127.50).  For purposes of the vesting provision
    set forth in clause (ii) above, the EBITDA target for the year
    in which the Change in Control occurs shall be equitably
    adjusted by the Board of Directors in good faith in consultation
    with the chief executive officer (which adjustment shall take
    into account the time during such year at which the Change in
    Control occurs). Performance vesting options that vest based on
    the investment return to the Sponsors will only vest upon the
    occurrence of a Change in Control if, as a result of such event,
    the applicable Investor Return (i.e., at least two times the
    price paid to the shareholders in the Merger for half of these
    options and at least two-and-one-half times the price paid to
    the shareholders in the Merger for the other half of these
    options) is also achieved in such transaction (if not previously
    achieved). “Change in Control” means in one or more of
    a series of transactions (i) the transfer or sale of all or
    substantially all of the assets of the Company (or any direct or
    indirect parent of the Company) to an Unaffiliated Person (as
    defined below); (ii) a merger, consolidation,
    recapitalization or reorganization of the Company (or any direct
    or indirect parent of the Company) with or into another
    Unaffiliated Person, or a transfer or sale of the voting stock
    of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent of the
    Company), an Investor, or any affiliate of any of the Investors
    to an Unaffiliated Person, in any such event that results in
    more than 50% of the common stock of the Company (or any direct
    or indirect parent of the Company) or the resulting company
    being held by an Unaffiliated Person; or (iii) a merger,
    consolidation, recapitalization or reorganization of the Company
    (or any direct or indirect parent of the Company) with or into
    another Unaffiliated Person, or a transfer or sale by the
    Company (or any direct or indirect parent of the Company), an
    Investor or any affiliate of any of the Investors, in any such
    event after which the Investors and their affiliates
    (x) collectively own less than 15% of the Common Stock of
    and (y) collectively have the ability to appoint less than
    50% of the directors to the Board (or any resulting company
    after a merger). For purposes of this definition, the term
    “Unaffiliated Person” means a person or group who is
    not an Investor, an affiliate of any of the Investors or an
    entity in which any Investor holds, directly or indirectly, a
    majority of the economic interest in such entity.



Additional information regarding applicable payments under such
    agreements for the named executive officers is provided under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements” and “Potential Payments Upon Termination
    or Change in Control.”

Recoupment
    of Compensation

While we do not presently have any formal policies or practices
    that provide for the recovery or adjustment of amounts
    previously paid to a named executive officer in the event the
    operating results on which the payment was based were restated
    or otherwise adjusted, in such event we would reserve the right
    to seek all appropriate remedies available under the law.

Tax and
    Accounting Implications

Following the Merger and during 2007, the equity securities of
    HCA were not registered with the SEC; accordingly,
    Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended
    (the “Code”) did not apply to the Company and was not
    considered in determining 2007 compensation.

The Committee operates its compensation programs with the good
    faith intention of complying with Section 409A of the
    Internal Revenue Code. We account for stock based payments with
    respect to our long term equity incentive award programs in
    accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123(R).

Compensation
    Committee Report

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the
    foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.
    Based on our review and discussion with management, we have
    recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis be included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation for 2006 reflects amounts
    paid under the 2006 PEP in November 2006, which amounts became
    due and payable to certain of our executive officers, including
    the named executive officers, as a result of the change in
    control of the Company upon consummation of the Merger.

(5)

All amounts for 2007 are attributable to changes in value of the
    SERP benefits. Assumptions used to calculate these figures are
    provided under the table titled “Pension Benefits.”
    The changes in the SERP benefit value during 2007 were impacted
    mainly by: (i) the passage of time which reflects another
    year of pay and service, (ii) the discount rate changing
    from 5.75% to 6.00%, which resulted in a decrease in the value
    and (iii) the use of the named executive officers’
    actual elections compared to 2006 when benefits were valued
    assuming a 50% probability of electing a lump sum and a 50%
    probability of electing an annuity. All named executive officers
    elected a lump sum payment at retirement, with the exception of
    Mr. Bovender, who elected an annuity. The impact of each of
    these events on the SERP benefit values were:

All amounts for 2006 are attributable to increases in value to
    the SERP benefits. In addition to the assumptions set forth
    under the table titled “Pension Benefits,” for the
    purposes of calculating the 2006 figures, benefits are valued
    assuming a 50% probability of electing a lump sum and a 50%
    probability of electing an annuity.
    Messrs. Bovender’s, Bracken’s Johnson’s and
    Hazen’s SERP benefit value increased in 2006 by $4,185,617,
    $1,272,074, $299,972, and $287,717, respectively, as a result of
    the passage of time. In 2006, their SERP benefit value further
    increased due to three special, one-time events: (i) the
    payments made under the 2006 Senior Officer PEP in November 2006
    described in footnote (4) to the Summary Compensation
    Table, which had the effect of increasing the named executive
    officers’ current final average earnings; (ii) the
    Merger constituted a change in control under the terms of the
    SERP, which triggered a decrease in the normal retirement age
    under the SERP from age 65 (or 62 with 10 years of service)
    to age 60; and (iii) the Committee approved the
    amendment of the SERP to include a lump sum payment provision
    and to revise certain actuarial factors. The impact of each of
    these events on the SERP benefit values were:

Personal use of corporate aircraft. In 2007,
    Messrs. Bovender and Bracken were allowed personal use of
    the Company airplane with an incremental cost of approximately
    $21,350 and $26,895, respectively, to the Company.
    Messrs. Johnson and Hazen and Ms. Wallace did not have
    any personal travel on the Company plane in 2007. We calculate
    the aggregate incremental cost of the personal use of Company
    aircraft based on a methodology that includes the average
    aggregate cost, on a per nautical mile basis, of variable
    expenses incurred in connection with personal plane usage,
    including trip-related maintenance, landing fees, fuel, crew
    hotels and meals, on-board catering, trip-related hangar and
    parking costs and other variable costs. Because our aircraft are
    used primarily for business travel, our incremental cost
    methodology does not include fixed costs of owning and operating
    aircraft that do not change based on usage. We grossed up the
    income attributed to Messrs. Bovender and Bracken with
    respect to certain trips on the Company plane. The additional
    income



attributed to them as a result of gross ups was $629 and $863,
    respectively. In addition, we will pay the travel expenses of
    our executives’ spouses associated with travel to business
    related events at which spouse attendance is appropriate. We
    paid approximately $342 for travel by Mr. Bracken’s
    wife on a commercial airline and related expenses for such an
    event, and additional income of $123 was attributed to
    Mr. Bracken as a result of the gross up on such amount.

2006 Amounts consist of:

•

The cash payment received as a result of the deemed purchase
    under the MSPP. Salary amounts withheld on behalf of the
    participants in the MSPP through the closing date of the Merger
    were deemed to have been used to purchase shares of our common
    stock under the terms of the MSPP, using the closing date of the
    Merger as the last date of the applicable offering period, and
    then converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to
    the number of shares deemed purchased under the MSPP multiplied
    by $51.00. Salary amounts were refunded to the participants, and
    they also received a cash payment equal to the difference
    between $51.00 and the deemed purchase price, multiplied by the
    number of shares the participant was deemed to have purchased.
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, Johnson and Hazen received cash
    payments of $20,860, $27,326, $24,157 and $25,379, respectively.

•

    respectively, for each issued and outstanding share of common
    stock of HCA, including restricted shares.
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, Johnson and Hazen received
    aggregate dividends of $82,525, $42,030, $25,267 and $27,754,
    respectively, in 2006 in respect of restricted shares held by
    them.

•

Personal use of corporate aircraft. In 2006, each of
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, Johnson and Hazen were allowed
    personal use of the Company airplane with an incremental cost of
    approximately $30,336, $12,173, $11,308 and $6,812,
    respectively, to the Company, calculated as described above. We
    grossed up the income attributed to Messrs. Bovender and
    Bracken with respect to certain trips on the Company plane. The
    additional income attributed to them as a result of gross ups
    was $1,287 and $522, respectively. In addition, we will pay the
    travel expenses of our executives’ spouses associated with
    travel to business related events at which spouse attendance is
    appropriate. We paid approximately $469 for travel by
    Mr. Bracken’s wife on a commercial airline for such an
    event.

Non-equity incentive awards granted each of the named executive
    officers pursuant to our 2007 PEP, as described in more detail
    under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis —
    Annual Incentive Compensation: PEP.” The amounts shown in
    the “Threshold” column reflect the threshold payment,
    which is 50% of the amount shown in the “Target”
    column. The amount shown in the “Maximum” column is
    200% of the target amount. These amounts are based on the
    individual’s salary and position as of the date the 2007
    Senior Officer PEP was approved by the Compensation Committee.
    Pursuant to the terms of the 2007 PEP, awards have already been
    determined and paid out to the named executive officers, at the
    maximum level, with the exception of Mr. Hazen, whose award
    vested and was paid out at 175.6% of the target amount.
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, Johnson and Hazen and
    Ms. Wallace will receive $3,888,547, $1,909,570, $900,455,
    $830,779 and $840,000, respectively, under the 2007 Senior
    Officer PEP; such amounts are reflected in the “Non-Equity
    Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary
    Compensation Table.

(2)

Stock options awarded under the 2006 Plan by the Compensation
    Committee as part of the named executive officer’s long
    term equity incentive award. The New Options granted in 2007 are
    structured so that 1/3 are time vested options (vesting in five
    equal installments on the first five anniversaries of the grant
    date), 1/3 are EBITDA-based performance vested options and 1/3
    are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors. The time vested options are reflected in the
    “All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying
    Options” column, and the EBITDA-based performance vested
    options and investment return performance vested options are
    both reflected in the “Estimated Possible Payouts Under
    Equity Incentive Plan Awards — Target” column.
    The terms of these option awards are described in more detail
    under “Compensation Discussion and Analysis —
    Long Term Equity Incentive Awards — Stock
    Options.” The compensation expense recognized in our
    financial statements for fiscal year 2007 in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) with respect to these option grants is
    reflected in the “Option Awards” column of the Summary
    Compensation Table.

Narrative
    Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of
    Plan-Based Awards Table

Total
    Compensation

In 2007, total direct compensation, as described in the Summary
    Compensation Table, consisted primarily of base salary, annual
    PEP awards payable in cash, and long term stock option grants.
    This mix was intended to reflect our philosophy that a
    significant portion of an executive’s compensation should
    be equity-linked

and/or

tied
    to our operating performance. In addition, we provided an
    opportunity for executives to participate in two supplemental
    retirement plans. In 2006, by contrast, total compensation, as
    described in the Summary Compensation Table, was significantly
    impacted by the Merger and related one time events.



Options

In January 2007, New Options to purchase common stock of the
    Company were granted under the 2006 Plan to members of
    management and key employees, including the named executive
    officers. The New Options were designed to be long term equity
    incentive awards, constituting a one-time stock option grant in
    lieu of annual equity grants. The New Options granted in 2007
    have a ten year term and are structured so that


/


are time vested options (vesting in five equal installments on
    the first five anniversaries of the grant date),


/


are EBITDA-based performance vested options and


/


are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors. The terms of the New Options granted in 2007 are
    described in greater detail under “Compensation Discussion
    and Analysis — Long Term Equity Incentive Awards:
    Options.” Compensation expense associated with the New
    Option awards was recognized in 2007 in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) and is included under the “Option
    Awards” column of the Summary Compensation Table. New
    Options granted to the named executive officers in 2007 are
    described in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

As a result of the Merger, all unvested awards under the 2005
    Plan (and all predecessor equity incentive plans) vested in
    November 2006. Generally, all outstanding options under the 2005
    Plan (and any predecessor plans) were cancelled and converted
    into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the number of
    shares of common stock underlying the option multiplied by the
    amount by which the Merger consideration of $51.00 per share
    exceeded the exercise price for the options (without interest
    and less any applicable withholding taxes). However, certain
    members of management, including the named executive officers,
    were given the opportunity to convert options held by them prior
    to consummation of the Merger into options to purchase shares of
    common stock of the surviving corporation (“Rollover
    Options”). Immediately after the consummation of the
    Merger, all Rollover Options (other than those with an exercise
    price below $12.75) were adjusted so that they retained the same
    “spread value” (as defined below) as immediately prior
    to the Merger, but the new per share exercise price for all
    Rollover Options would be $12.75. The term “spread
    value” means the difference between (x) the aggregate
    fair market value of the common stock (determined using the
    Merger consideration of $51.00 per share) subject to the
    outstanding options held by the participant immediately prior to
    the Merger that became Rollover Options, and (y) the
    aggregate exercise price of those options. All previously
    unrecognized compensation expense associated with the Rollover
    Options was recognized in 2006; therefore, we did not record any
    compensation expense related to the Rollover Options in 2007.
    New Options and Rollover Options held by the named executive
    officers are described in the Outstanding Equity Awards at
    Fiscal Year-End Table.

Employment
    Agreements

In connection with the Merger, on November 16, 2006,
    Hercules Holding entered into substantially similar employment
    agreements with each of the named executive officers and certain
    other executives, which agreements were shortly thereafter
    assumed by the Company and which agreements govern the terms of
    each executive’s employment. The term of employment under
    each of these agreements is indefinite and they are terminable
    by either party at any time; provided that an executive must
    give no less than 90 days notice prior to a resignation.

Each employment agreement sets forth the executive’s annual
    base salary, which will be subject to discretionary annual
    increases upon review by the Board of Directors, and states that
    the executive will be eligible to earn an annual bonus as a
    percentage of salary with respect to each fiscal year, based
    upon the extent to which annual performance targets established
    by the Board of Directors are achieved. With respect to the 2007
    fiscal year, each executive was eligible to earn under the 2007
    PEP (i) a target bonus, if 2007 performance targets were
    met; (ii) a specified percentage of the target bonus, if
    “threshold” levels of performance were achieved but
    performance targets were not met; or (iii) a multiple of
    the target bonus if “maximum” performance goals were
    achieved, with the annual bonus amount being interpolated, in
    the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, for performance
    results that exceeded “threshold” levels but do not
    meet or exceed “maximum” levels. As described above,
    awards under the 2007 PEP have already been determined and paid
    out to the named executive officers, at the maximum level, with
    the exception of Mr. Hazen, whose award was paid out at
    175.6% of his target amount. The employment agreements commit us
    to provide each executive with annual bonus opportunities in
    2008 that are consistent with those applicable to the 2007
    fiscal year, unless doing so would be adverse to our interests
    or the interests of our shareholders. For later fiscal years,
    the Board of Directors will set bonus opportunities in
    consultation with our Chief Executive Officer. Each employment
    agreement also sets forth the number of options that the
    executive



received pursuant to the 2006 Plan as a percentage of the total
    equity initially made available for grants pursuant to the 2006
    Plan. Such option awards, the New Options, were made
    January 30, 2007 and are described above.

Pursuant to each employment agreement, if an executive’s
    employment terminates due to death or disability, the executive
    would be entitled to receive (i) any base salary and any
    bonus that is earned and unpaid through the date of termination;
    (ii) reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses
    properly incurred by the executive; (iii) such employee
    benefits, if any, as to which the executive may be entitled
    under our employee benefit plans (the payments and benefits
    described in (i) through (iii) being “accrued
    rights”); and (iv) a pro rata portion of any annual
    bonus that the executive would have been entitled to receive
    pursuant to the employment agreement based upon our actual
    results for the year of termination (with such proration based
    on the percentage of the fiscal year that shall have elapsed
    through the date of termination of employment, payable to the
    executive when the annual bonus would have been otherwise
    payable (the “pro rata bonus”)).

If an executive’s employment is terminated by us without
    “cause” (as defined below) or by the executive for
    “good reason” (as defined below) (each a
    “qualifying termination”), the executive would be
    (i) entitled to the accrued rights; (ii) subject to
    compliance with certain confidentiality, non-competition and
    non-solicitation covenants contained in his or her employment
    agreement and execution of a general release of claims on behalf
    of the Company, an amount equal to the product of (x) two
    (three in the case of Jack O. Bovender, Jr., Richard M.
    Bracken and R. Milton Johnson) and (y) the sum of
    (A) the executive’s base salary and (B) annual
    bonus paid or payable in respect of the fiscal year immediately
    preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, payable
    over a two-year period; (iii) entitled to the pro rata
    bonus; and (iv) entitled to continued coverage under our
    group health plans during the period over which the cash
    severance described in clause (ii) is paid. However, in
    lieu of receiving the payments and benefits described in (ii),
    (iii) and (iv) immediately above, the executive may
    instead elect to have his or her covenants not to compete waived
    by us. The same severance applies regardless of whether the
    termination was in connection with a change in control of the
    Company.

“Cause” is defined as an executive’s
    (i) willful and continued failure to perform his material
    duties to the Company which continues beyond 10 business days
    after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered;
    (ii) willful or intentional engagement in material
    misconduct that causes material and demonstrable injury,
    monetarily or otherwise, to the Company or the Sponsors;
    (iii) conviction of, or a plea of

nolo contendere

to, a crime constituting a felony, or a misdemeanor for
    which a sentence of more than six months’ imprisonment is
    imposed; or (iv) willful and material breach of his
    covenants under the employment agreement which continues beyond
    the designated cure period or of the agreements relating to the
    new equity. “Good Reason” is defined as (i) a
    reduction in the executive’s base salary (other than a
    general reduction that affects all similarly situated employees
    in substantially the same proportions which is implemented by
    the Board in good faith after consultation with the chief
    executive officer and chief operating officer, a reduction in
    the executive’s annual incentive compensation opportunity,
    or the reduction of benefits payable to the executive under the
    SERP; (ii) a substantial diminution in the executive’s
    title, duties and responsibilities; or (iii) a transfer of
    the executive’s primary workplace to a location that is
    more than 20 miles from his current workplace (other than,
    in the case of (i) and (ii), any isolated, insubstantial
    and inadvertent failure that is not in bad faith and is cured
    within 10 business days after executive’s written notice to
    the Company).

In the event of an executive’s termination of employment
    that is not a qualifying termination or a termination due to
    death or disability, he or she will only be entitled to the
    “accrued rights” (as defined above).

In each of the employment agreements with the named executive
    officers, we also commit to grant, among the named executive
    officers and certain other executives, 10% of the options
    initially authorized for grant under the 2006 Plan at some time
    before November 17, 2011 (but with a good faith commitment
    to do so before a “change in control” (as defined in
    the 2006 Plan and set forth above) or a “public
    offering” (as defined in the 2006 Plan) and before the time
    when our Board of Directors reasonably believes that the fair
    market value of our common stock is likely to exceed the
    equivalent of $102.00 per share) at an exercise price per share
    that is the equivalent of $102.00 per share (“2x Time
    Options”). A percentage of these options will be vested at
    the time of the grant, such percentage corresponding to the
    elapsed percentage of the period measured between
    November 17, 2006 and November 17, 2011. When granted,
    these options will be allocated among the recipients by our
    Board of Directors in consultation with our chief executive
    officer based upon the perceived contributions of each recipient
    since November 17, 2006.



The terms of the 2x Time Options will otherwise be consistent
    with other time vesting options granted under the 2006 Plan.
    Additionally, pursuant to the employment agreements, we agree to
    indemnify each executive against any adverse tax consequences
    (including, without limitation, under Section 409A and 4999
    of the Internal Revenue Code), if any, that result from the
    adjustment by us of stock options held by the executive in
    connection with Merger or the future payment of any
    extraordinary cash dividends.

In light of his long-term service to the Company,
    Mr. Bovender’s employment agreement provides for
    certain continued vesting of Mr. Bovender’s New
    Options and any issued 2x Time Options, upon any termination of
    his employment after he has attained 62 years of age (other
    than a termination for cause). Mr. Bovender’s
    agreement further provides that neither Mr. Bovender nor we
    will have any put or call rights with respect to his options
    granted pursuant to the 2006 Plan or stock acquired upon
    exercise of such options. The terms of Mr. Bovender’s
    employment agreement with respect to termination of his
    employment are described in greater detail under
    “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Severance
    and Change in Control Agreements.”

Additional information with respect to potential payments to the
    named executive officers pursuant to their employment agreements
    and the 2006 Plan is contained in “Potential Payments Upon
    Termination or Change in Control.”

Reflects Rollover Options, as further described under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Options,” and
    the 20% of the named executive officer’s EBITDA-based
    performance vested New Options that vested as of
    December 31, 2007 (upon the Committee’s determination
    that the Company achieved the 2007 EBITDA performance target
    under the option awards, as adjusted, as described in more
    detail under “Compensation Discussion and
    Analysis — Long Term Equity Incentive Awards:
    Options”).

(2)

Reflects New Options awarded in January 2007 under the 2006 Plan
    by the Compensation Committee as part of the named executive
    officer’s long term equity incentive award. The New Options
    granted in 2007 are structured so that 1/3 are time vested
    options (vesting in five equal installments on the first five
    anniversaries of the January 30, 2007 grant date), 1/3 are
    EBITDA-based performance vested options (vesting in equal
    increments of 20% at the end of fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009,
    2010 and 2011 if certain annual EBITDA performance targets are
    achieved, subject to “catch up” vesting if at the end
    of any year noted above or at the end of fiscal year 2012, the
    cumulative total EBITDA earned in all prior years exceeds the
    cumulative EBITDA target at the end of such fiscal year) and 1/3
    are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors (vesting with respect to 10% of the common stock
    subject to such options at the end of fiscal years 2007,2008,
    2009, 2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return is at least $102.00
    and with respect to an additional 10% at the end of fiscal years
    2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return is at
    least $127.50, subject to “catch up” vesting if the
    relevant Investor Return is achieved at any time occurring prior
    to January 30, 2017, so long as the named executive officer
    remains employed by the Company). The time vested options are
    reflected in the “Number of Securities Underlying
    Unexercised Options Unexercisable” column, and the
    EBITDA-based performance vested options and investment return
    performance vested options are both reflected in the
    “Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Securities
    Underlying Unexercised Unearned Options” column (with the
    exception of the 20% of the EBITDA-based performance vested
    options that vested as of December 31, 2007, which are
    reflected in the “Number of Securities Underlying
    Unexercised Options Exercisable” column). The terms of
    these option awards are described in more detail under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Options.”



(3)

Immediately after the consummation of the Merger, all Rollover
    Options (other than those with an exercise price below $12.75)
    were adjusted such that they retained the same “spread
    value” (as defined below) as immediately prior to the
    Merger, but the new per share exercise price for all Rollover
    Options would be $12.75. The term “spread value” means
    the difference between (x) the aggregate fair market value
    of the common stock (determined using the Merger consideration
    of $51.00 per share) subject to the outstanding options held by
    the participant immediately prior to the Merger that became
    Rollover Options, and (y) the aggregate exercise price of
    those options.

(4)

The exercise price for the New Options granted under the 2006
    Plan to the named executive officers on January 30, 2007
    was equal to the fair value of our common stock on the date of
    the grant, as determined by our Board of Directors in
    consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and other
    advisors, pursuant to the terms of the 2006 Plan.

Option
    Exercises and Stock Vested

The named executive officers did not exercise any options during
    the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

Pension
    Benefits

Our SERP is intended to qualify as a “top-hat” plan
    designed to benefit a select group of management or highly
    compensated employees. There are no other defined benefit plans
    that provide for payments or benefits to any of the named
    executive officers. Information about benefits provided by the
    SERP is as follows:

Mr. Bovender is eligible for normal retirement.
    Mr. Bracken and Ms. Wallace are eligible for early
    retirement. The remaining named executive officers have not
    satisfied the eligibility requirements for normal or early
    retirement. All of the named executive officers are 100% vested
    in their accrued SERP benefit.

Plan
    Provisions

In the event the employee’s “accrued benefits under
    the Company’s Plans” (computed using “actuarial
    factors”) are insufficient to provide the “life
    annuity amount,” the SERP will provide a benefit equal to
    the amount of the shortfall. Benefits can be paid in the form of
    an annuity or a lump sum. The lump sum is calculated by
    converting the annuity benefit using the “actuarial
    factors.” All benefits with a present value not exceeding
    one million dollars are paid as a lump sum regardless of the
    election made.

Normal retirement eligibility requires attainment of age 60
    for employees who were participants at the time of the change in
    control which occurred as a result of the Merger, including all
    of the named executive officers. Early retirement eligibility
    requires age 55 with 20 or more years of service. The
    service requirement for early retirement is waived for employees
    participating in the SERP at the time of its inception in 2001,
    including all of the named executive officers. The “life
    annuity amount” payable to a participant who takes early
    retirement is reduced by three percent for each full year or
    portion thereof that the participant retires prior to normal
    retirement age.

The “life annuity amount” is the annual benefit
    payable as a life annuity to a participant upon normal
    retirement. It is equal to the participant’s “accrual
    rate” multiplied by the product of the participant’s
    “years of service” times the participant’s
    “pay average.” The SERP benefit for each year equals
    the life annuity amount less the annual life annuity amount
    produced by the employee’s “accrued benefit under the
    Company’s Plans.”

The “accrual rate” is a percentage assigned to each
    participant, and is either 2.2% or 2.4%. All of the named
    executive officers are assigned a percentage of 2.4%.



A participant is credited with a “year of service” for
    each calendar year that the participant performs
    1,000 hours of service for HCA or one of our subsidiaries,
    or for each year the participant is otherwise credited by us,
    subject to a maximum credit of 25 years of service.

A participant’s “pay average” is an amount equal
    to one-fifth of the sum of the compensation during the period of
    60 consecutive months for which total compensation is greatest
    within the 120 consecutive month period immediately preceding
    the participant’s retirement. For purposes of this
    calculation, the participant’s compensation includes base
    compensation, payments under the PEP, and bonuses paid prior to
    the establishment of the PEP.

The “accrued benefits under the Company’s Plans”
    for an employee equals the sum of the employer-funded benefits
    accrued under the HCA Retirement Plan, the HCA 401(k) Plan and
    any other tax-qualified plan maintained by us or one of our
    subsidiaries, the income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the
    participant under any of these plans, the account credit and the
    income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the participant under
    the Restoration Plan and any other nonqualified retirement plans
    sponsored by us or one of our subsidiaries.

The “actuarial factors” include (a) interest at
    the long term Applicable Federal Rate under Section 1274(d)
    of the Code or any successor thereto as of the first day of
    November preceding the plan year in or for which a benefit
    amount is calculated, and (b) mortality based on the
    prevailing commissioner’s standard table (as described in
    Code section 807(d)(5)(A)) used in determining reserves for
    group annuity contracts.

Credited service does not include any amount other than service
    with us or one of our subsidiaries.

Assumptions

The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit is based on a
    measurement date of December 31, 2007. The measurement date
    for valuing plan liabilities on our balance sheet is
    September 30, 2007, but the measurement date will be
    changed at the end of Fiscal 2008 in accordance with the
    requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 158. Using a December 31 measurement date will produce
    consistent results year to year and make sure the most
    up-to-date pay information is included.

The assumption is made that there is no probability of
    pre-retirement death or termination. Retirement age is assumed
    to be the Normal Retirement Age as defined in the SERP for all
    named executive officers, as adjusted by the provisions relating
    to change in control, or age 60. Age 60 also
    represents the earliest date the named executive officers are
    eligible to receive an unreduced benefit.

All other assumptions used in the calculations are the same as
    those used for the valuation of the plan liabilities in this
    annual report.

Supplemental
    Information

In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits his rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any benefits already paid. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation

Amounts shown in the table are attributable to the HCA
    Restoration Plan, an unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution
    plan designed to restore benefits under the HCA Retirement Plan
    based on compensation in excess of Code Section 401(a)(17)
    compensation limit ($225,000 in 2007).

    Ms. Wallace have 28 years of service, 26 years of
    service, 25 years of service, 25 years of service and
    24 years of service, respectively. Hypothetical account
    balances are increased or decreased with investment earnings
    based on the actual investment return in the underlying
    qualified retirement plan trust (the HCA Retirement Plan).

Eligible employees make a one time election prior to
    participation (or prior to December 31, 2006, if earlier)
    regarding the form of distribution of the benefit. Participants
    choose between a lump sum and five or ten installments.
    Distributions are paid (or begin) during the July following the
    year of termination of employment or retirement. All balances
    not exceeding $500,000 are automatically paid as a lump sum. If
    no election is made, the benefit is paid in a lump sum.

Supplemental
    Information

In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any payments already made. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.



Potential
    Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

The following tables show the estimated amount of potential cash
    severance payable to each of the named executive officers, as
    well as the estimated value of continuing benefits, based on
    compensation and benefit levels in effect on December 31,
    2007, assuming the executive’s employment terminates or the
    Company undergoes a Change in Control (as defined in the 2006
    Plan and set forth above under “Narrative to Summary
    Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Options”) effective December 31,
    2007. Due to the numerous factors involved in estimating these
    amounts, the actual value of benefits and amounts to be paid can
    only be determined upon an executive’s termination of
    employment.

Director
    Compensation

During the year ended December 31, 2007, none of our
    directors received compensation for their service as a member of
    our Board. Our directors are reimbursed for any expenses
    incurred in connection with their service.

Compensation
    Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

During 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors was composed of Michael W. Michelson, George A. Bitar,
    John P. Connaughton and Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D.
    Dr. Frist served as an executive officer and Chairman of
    our Board of Directors from January 2001 to January 2002. From
    July 1997 to January 2001, Dr. Frist served as our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Frist served as Vice
    Chairman of the Board of Directors from April 1995 to July 1997
    and as Chairman from February 1994 to April 1995. He was
    Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of HCA-Hospital
    Corporation of America from 1988 to February 1994.



Dr. Frist is the father of Thomas F. Frist III, who also
    serves as a director. None of the other members of the
    Compensation Committee have at any time been an officer or
    employee of HCA or any of its subsidiaries. Each member of the
    Compensation Committee is also a manager of Hercules Holding,
    and the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement
    of Hercules Holding requires that the members of Hercules
    Holding take all necessary action to ensure that the persons who
    serves as managers of Hercules Holding also serve on our Board
    of Directors. Messrs. Michelson, Bitar and Connaughton are
    affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., Merrill
    Lynch Global Private Equity, and Bain Capital Partners,
    respectively, each of which is a party to the sponsor management
    agreement with us. Dr. Frist and certain other members of
    the Frist family, are also party to the sponsor management
    agreement with us. The Amended and Restated Limited Liability
    Company Agreement of Hercules Holding and the sponsor management
    agreement are described in greater detail in Item 13,
    “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”

Item 12.

Security
    Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and
    Related Stockholder Matters

The following table sets forth information regarding the
    beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February 29,
    2008 for:

•

each person who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5%
    of the outstanding shares of our common stock;

•

each of our directors;

•

each of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation
    Table; and

•

all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

The percentages of shares outstanding provided in the tables are
    based on 94,171,740 shares of our common stock, par value
    $0.01 per share, outstanding as of February 29, 2008.
    Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules
    of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power
    with respect to securities. Shares issuable upon the exercise of
    options that are exercisable within 60 days of
    February 29, 2008 are considered outstanding for the
    purpose of calculating the percentage of outstanding shares of
    our common stock held by the individual, but not for the purpose
    of calculating the percentage of outstanding shares held by any
    other individual.

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions

In accordance with its charter, our Audit and Compliance
    Committee reviews and approves all material related party
    transactions. Prior to its approval of any material related
    party transaction, the Audit and Compliance Committee will
    discuss the proposed transaction with management and our
    independent auditor. In addition, our Code of Conduct requires
    that all of our employees, including our executive officers,
    remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of their
    responsibilities to the Company. An executive officer who wishes
    to enter into a transaction in which their interests might
    conflict with ours must first receive the approval of the Audit
    and Compliance Committee. The Amended and Restated Limited
    Liability Company Agreement of Hercules Holding II, LLC
    generally requires that an Investor must obtain the prior
    written consent of each other Investor before it or any of its
    affiliates (including our directors) enter into any transaction
    with us.

Stockholder
    Agreements

On January 30, 2007, our Board of Directors awarded to
    members of management and certain key employees New Options to
    purchase shares of our common stock (New Options together with
    the Rollover Options, “Options”) pursuant to the 2006
    Plan. Our Compensation Committee approved additional option
    awards periodically throughout the year ended December 31,
    2007 to members of management and certain key employees in cases
    of promotions and new hires. In connection with their option
    awards, the participants under the 2006 Plan were required to
    enter into a Management Stockholder’s Agreement, a Sale
    Participation Agreement, and an Option Agreement with respect to
    the New Options. Below are brief summaries of the principal
    terms of the Management Stockholder’s Agreement and the
    Sale Participation Agreement each of which are qualified in
    their entirety by reference to the agreements themselves, forms
    of which were filed as Exhibits 10.12 and 10.13,
    respectively, to our Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The terms of
    the Option Agreement with respect to New Options and the 2006
    Plan are described in more detail in Item 11,
    “Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion
    and Analysis — Long Term Equity Incentive Awards.”

Management Stockholder’s Agreement.

The
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement imposes significant
    restrictions on transfers of shares of our common stock.
    Generally, shares will be nontransferable by any means at any
    time prior to the earlier of a “Change in Control” (as
    defined in the Management Stockholder’s Agreement) or the
    fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, except
    (i) sales pursuant to an effective registration statement
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
    “Securities Act”) filed by the Company in accordance
    with the Management Stockholder’s Agreement, (ii) a
    sale pursuant to the Sale Participation Agreement (described
    below), (iii) a sale to certain “Permitted
    Transferees” (as defined in the Management
    Stockholder’s Agreement), or (iv) as otherwise
    permitted by our Board of Directors or pursuant to a waiver of
    the restrictions on transfers given by



unanimous agreement of the Sponsors. On and after such fifth
    anniversary through the earlier of a Change in Control or the
    eighth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, a
    management stockholder will be able to transfer shares of our
    common stock, but only to the extent that, on a cumulative
    basis, the management stockholders in the aggregate do not
    transfer a greater percentage of their equity than the
    percentage of equity sold or otherwise disposed of by the
    Sponsors.

In the event that a management stockholder wishes to sell their
    stock at any time following the fifth anniversary of the closing
    date of the Merger but prior to an initial public offering of
    our common stock, the Management Stockholder’s Agreement
    provides the Company with a right of first offer on those shares
    upon the same terms and conditions pursuant to which the
    management stockholder would sell them to a third party. In the
    event that a registration statement is filed with respect to our
    common stock in the future, the Management Stockholder’s
    Agreement prohibits management stockholders from selling shares
    not included in the registration statement from the time of
    receipt of notice until 180 days (in the case of an initial
    public offering) or 90 days (in the case of any other
    public offering) of the date of the registration statement. The
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement also provides for the
    management stockholder’s ability to cause us to repurchase
    their outstanding stock and options in the event of the
    management stockholder’s death or disability, and for our
    ability to cause the management stockholder to sell their stock
    or options back to the Company upon certain termination events.

The Management Stockholder’s Agreement provides that, in
    the event we propose to sell shares to the Sponsors, certain
    members of senior management, including the executive officers
    (the “Senior Management Stockholders”) have a
    preemptive right to purchase shares in the offering. The maximum
    shares a Senior Management Stockholder may purchase is a
    proportionate number of the shares offered to the percentage of
    shares owned by the Senior Management Stockholder prior to the
    offering. Additionally, following the initial public offering of
    our common stock, the Senior Management Stockholders will have
    limited “piggyback” registration rights with respect
    to their shares of common stock. The maximum number of shares of
    Common Stock which a Senior Management Stockholder may register
    is generally proportionate with the percentage of common stock
    being sold by the Sponsors (relative to their holdings thereof).

Sale Participation Agreement.

The Sale
    Participation Agreement grants the Senior Management
    Stockholders the right to participate in any private direct or
    indirect sale of shares of common stock by the Sponsors (such
    right being referred to herein as the “Tag-Along
    Right”), and requires all management stockholders to
    participate in any such private sale if so elected by the
    Sponsors in the event that the Sponsors are proposing to sell at
    least 50% of the outstanding common stock held by the Sponsors,
    whether directly or through their interests in Hercules Holding
    (such right being referred to herein as the “Drag-Along
    Right”). The number of shares of common stock which would
    be required to be sold by a management stockholder pursuant to
    the exercise of the Drag-Along Right will be the sum of the
    number of shares of common stock then owned by the management
    stockholder and his affiliates plus all shares of common stock
    the management stockholder is entitled to acquire under any
    unexercised Options (to the extent such Options are exercisable
    or would become exercisable as a result of the consummation of
    the proposed sale), multiplied by a fraction (x) the
    numerator of which shall be the aggregate number of shares of
    common stock proposed to be transferred by the Sponsors in the
    proposed sale and (y) the denominator of which shall be the
    total number of shares of common stock owned by the sponsors
    entitled to participate in the proposed sale. Management
    stockholders will bear their pro rata share of any fees,
    commissions, adjustments to purchase price, expenses or
    indemnities in connection with any sale under the Sale
    Participation Agreement.

Amended
    and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Hercules
    Holding II, LLC

The Investors and certain other investment funds who agreed to
    co-invest with them through a vehicle jointly controlled by the
    Investors to provide equity financing for the Recapitalization
    entered into a limited liability company operating agreement in
    respect of Hercules Holding (the “LLC Agreement”). The
    LLC Agreement contains agreements among the parties with respect
    to the election of our directors, restrictions on the issuance
    or transfer of interests in us, including a right of first
    offer, tag-along rights and drag-along rights, and other
    corporate governance provisions (including the right to approve
    various corporate actions).

Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, Hercules Holding and its members
    are required to take necessary action to ensure that each
    manager on the board of Hercules Holding also serves on our
    Board of Directors. Each of the



Sponsors has the right to appoint three managers to Hercules
    Holding’s board, the Frist family has the right to appoint
    two managers to the board, and the remaining two managers on the
    board are to come from our management team (currently
    Messrs. Bovender and Bracken). The rights of the Sponsors
    and the Frist family to designate managers are subject to their
    ownership percentages in Hercules Holding remaining above a
    specified percentage of the outstanding ownership interests in
    Hercules Holding.

The LLC Agreement also requires that, in addition to a majority
    of the total number of managers being present to constitute a
    quorum for the transaction of business at any board or committee
    meeting, at least one manager designated by each of the
    Investors must be present, unless waived by that Investor. The
    LLC Agreement further provides that, for so long as at least two
    Sponsors are entitled to designate managers to Hercules
    Holding’s board, at least one manager from each of two
    Sponsors must consent to any board or committee action in order
    for it to be valid. The LLC Agreement requires that our
    organizational and governing documents contain provisions
    similar to those described in this paragraph.

Registration
    Rights Agreement

Hercules Holding and the Investors entered into a registration
    rights agreement with us upon completion of the
    Recapitalization. Pursuant to this agreement, the Investors can
    cause us to register shares of our common stock held by Hercules
    Holding under the Securities Act and, if requested, to maintain
    a shelf registration statement effective with respect to such
    shares. The Investors are also entitled to participate on a pro
    rata basis in any registration of our common stock under the
    Securities Act that we may undertake.

Sponsor
    Management Agreement

In connection with the Merger, we entered into a management
    agreement with affiliates of each of the Sponsors and certain
    members of the Frist family, including Thomas F.
    Frist, Jr., M.D. and Thomas F. Frist III,
    pursuant to which such entities or their affiliates will provide
    management services to us. Pursuant to the agreement, in 2007,
    we paid aggregate management fees of $16.85 million
    (comprised of approximately $1.85 million for the period of
    2006 following the Merger and $15 million for
    2007) and reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
    connection with the provision of services pursuant to the
    agreement. The agreement provides that the aggregate annual
    management fee, initially set at $15 million, increases
    annually beginning in 2008 at a rate equal to the percentage
    increase of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Management
    Agreement) in the applicable year compared to the preceding
    year. The agreement also provides that we will pay a one percent
    fee in connection with certain subsequent financing,
    acquisition, disposition and change of control transactions, as
    well as a termination fee based on the net present value of
    future payment obligations under the management agreement, in
    the event of an initial public offering or under certain other
    circumstances. No fees were paid under either of these
    provisions in 2007. The agreement includes customary exculpation
    and indemnification provisions in favor of the Sponsors and
    their affiliates and the Frists.

Other
    Relationships

In connection with the Merger, pursuant to the Offer to Purchase
    and Consent Solicitation dated October 6, 2006, we
    repurchased approximately $1.3 billion in the aggregate of
    our outstanding 8.850% Medium Term Notes due 2007, 7.000% Notes
    due 2007, 7.250% Notes due 2008, 5.250% Notes due 2008 and
    5.500% Notes due 2009.  Merrill Lynch & Co., along with
    other institutions, served as a dealer manager and solicitation
    agent in connection with the offer and consent solicitation. In
    consideration of their services in such capacity, $415,000 was
    paid to Merrill Lynch & Co.

On February 16, 2007, we entered into Amendment No. 1
    to our senior secured Credit Agreement, dated November 17,
    2006, among HCA Inc., HCA UK Capital Limited and the lending
    institutions from time to time parties thereto. Merrill Lynch,
    Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“MLPFS”),
    along with other institutions, served as joint lead arranger and
    joint bookrunner, and Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation
    (“MLCC”) served as documentation agent.  In
    consideration of their services in such capacity, $765,000 was
    paid to MLPFS and MLCC.



Merrill Lynch & Co., MLPFS and MLCC are affiliates of
    certain funds which hold substantial interests in Hercules
    Holding and Christopher J. Birosak, George A. Bitar and Nathan
    C. Thorne, who serve on our Board of Directors.

In 2007, we paid approximately $25 million to HCP, Inc.
    (NYSE: HCP), representing the aggregate annual lease payments
    for certain medical office buildings leased by the Company.
    Charles A. Elcan is an executive officer of HCP, Inc. and is the

son-in-law

and

brother-in-law

of Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and Thomas F.
    Frist, III, respectively, who are members of our Board of
    Directors.

Christopher S. George serves as the chief executive officer of
    an HCA-affiliated hospital, and in 2007, Mr. George
    received total compensation in respect of base salary and bonus
    of approximately $272,000 for his services. Mr. George also
    received certain other benefits, including awards of equity,
    customary to similar positions within the Company.
    Mr. George’s father, V. Carl George, is an executive
    officer of HCA.

Director

    Gordon, Michael W. Michelson, James C. Momtazee, Stephen G.

Indicates management director.

Though not formally considered by our Board because our common
    stock is not currently registered with the SEC or traded on any
    national securities exchange, based upon the listing standards
    of the NYSE, the national securities exchange upon which our
    common stock was traded prior to the Merger, we do not believe
    that any of our directors would be considered
    “independent” because of their relationships with
    certain affiliates of the funds and other entities which hold
    significant interests in Hercules Holding, which owns 97.5% of
    our outstanding common stock, and other relationships with us.
    See “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”
    Accordingly, we do not believe that any of Messrs. Birosak,
    Frist, Gordon or Momtazee, the members of our Audit and
    Compliance committee, would meet the independence requirements
    or

Rule 10A-1

of the Exchange Act or the NYSE’s audit committee
    independence requirements, or that Messrs. Michelson,
    Bitar, Connaughton or Frist, the members of our



Compensation Committee, would meet the NYSE’s independence
    requirements. We do not have a nominating/corporate governance
    committee, or a committee that serves a similar purpose.

Item 14.

Principal
    Accountant Fees and Services

The Audit and Compliance Committee has appointed
    Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public
    accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting
    firm will audit our consolidated financial statements for 2008
    and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008.

Audit Fees.

The aggregate audit fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered
    for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements,
    for the reviews of the condensed consolidated financial
    statements included in our quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

for the audit of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, under the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and services that are normally
    provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in
    connection with statutory and regulatory filings totaled
    $8.9 million for 2007 and $9.0 million for 2006.

Audit-Related Fees.

The aggregate fees billed
    by Ernst & Young LLP for assurance and related
    services not described above under “Audit Fees” were
    $1.3 million for 2007 and $1.5 million for 2006.
    Audit-related services principally include audits of certain of
    our subsidiaries and benefit plans.

Tax Fees.

The aggregate fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered
    for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning were
    $2.2 million for 2007 and $1.6 million for 2006.

All Other Fees.

The aggregate fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for products or services other than
    those described above were $749,000 for 2007 and $79,000 for
    2006.

The Board of Directors has adopted an Audit and Compliance
    Committee Charter which, among other things, requires the Audit
    and Compliance Committee to preapprove all audit and permitted
    nonaudit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be
    performed for us by our independent registered public accounting
    firm.

All services performed for us by Ernst & Young LLP in
    2007 were preapproved by the Audit and Compliance Committee. The
    Audit and Compliance Committee concluded that the provision of
    audit-related services, tax services and other services by
    Ernst & Young LLP was compatible with the maintenance
    of the firm’s independence in the conduct of its auditing
    functions. Our preapproval policy provides that the Audit and
    Compliance Committee shall preapprove nonaudit services and
    audit-related services. Any decisions to preapprove any services
    shall be presented to the Audit and Compliance Committee at its
    next scheduled meeting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ (deficit)
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” on January 1, 2007. As discussed in
    Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
    Company adopted the provisions of FASB Staff Position

NOTE 1 —

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Merger,
    Recapitalization and Reporting Entity

On November 17, 2006 HCA Inc. (the “Company”)
    completed its merger (the “Merger”) with Hercules
    Acquisition Corporation, pursuant to which the Company was
    acquired by Hercules Holding II, LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group including
    affiliates of Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
    Co., Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity (each a
    “Sponsor”) and affiliates of HCA founder,
    Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., (the “Frist Entities,”
    and together with the Sponsors, the “Investors”), and
    by members of management and certain other investors. The
    Merger, the financing transactions related to the Merger and
    other related transactions are collectively referred to in this
    annual report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger
    was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial
    statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our
    assets and liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees and certain other
    investors. Our common stock is not registered under the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not traded
    on a national securities exchange. Effective September 26,
    2007, we registered certain of our senior secured notes issued
    in connection with the Recapitalization with the Securities and
    Exchange Commission, thus subjecting us to the reporting
    requirements of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934.

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate
    hospitals and related health care entities. The term
    “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
    of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
    subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2007, these
    affiliates owned and operated 161 hospitals, 99 freestanding
    surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary
    services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in joint ventures
    that own and operate eight hospitals and nine freestanding
    surgery centers, which are accounted for using the equity
    method. The Company’s facilities are located in
    20 states and England. The terms “HCA,”
    “Company,” “we,” “our” or
    “us,” as used in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise stated or
    indicated by context.

Basis of
    Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
    and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
    “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting
    interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements
    include entities in which we absorb a majority of the
    entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the
    entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
    ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
    entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities that we do not control, but
    in which we have a substantial ownership interest and can
    exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the
    equity method.

We have completed various acquisitions and joint venture
    transactions. The accounts of these entities have been included
    in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent
    to our acquisition of controlling interests. The majority of our
    expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could
    be classified as general and administrative include our
    corporate office costs, which were $169 million,
    $187 million and $185 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
    are recorded based upon established billing rates less
    allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
    during the period the health care services are provided, based
    upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
    payers. Third-party payers

    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —

NOTE 1 —

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES (Continued)

Revenues
    (Continued)

include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial
    insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual
    allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the
    payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
    Contractual payment terms in managed care agreements are
    generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem
    rates or discounted fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
    there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded
    estimates will change by a material amount. The estimated
    reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost
    reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are
    determined (in relation to certain government programs,
    primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the
    “cost report” filing and settlement process). The
    adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
    in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports
    filed during the respective year were $47 million,
    $55 million and $49 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement
    amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related
    primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were
    $83 million, $62 million and $36 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, us to provide services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts
    determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
    revenues. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care,
    who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level,
    are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is
    established by the federal government and is based on income and
    family size. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do
    not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
    similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
    qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance
    subsidiary’s cash equivalent investments in excess of the
    amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims
    during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash
    equivalents as these funds are not available for general
    corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
    approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of
    available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when
    presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks
    totaling $370 million and $429 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been
    included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are
    funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts
    Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state
    agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed
    care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and
    patients. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
    and 2005, 24%, 26% and 27%, respectively, of our revenues
    related to patients participating in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program. We recognize that revenues and receivables
    from government agencies are significant to our operations, but
    do not believe there are significant credit risks associated
    with these government agencies. We do not believe there are any
    other significant concentrations of revenues from any particular
    payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in
    the collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
    means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
    off as uncollectable are deducted from the allowance for
    doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The
    amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical and expected net
    collections, business and economic conditions, trends in
    federal, state and private employer health care coverage and
    other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts
    and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to
    “uninsured” amounts (including copayment and
    deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage)
    due directly from patients. Accounts are written off when all
    reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
    performed. We consider the return of an account from the
    secondary external collection agency to be the culmination of
    our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for
    writing off the account balance (prior to August 1, 2007,
    we wrote accounts off upon their return from the primary
    external agency). Writeoffs are based upon specific
    identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff
    adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management
    relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical
    writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
    of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
    analysis”) as a primary source of information to utilize in
    estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We
    perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling
    twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data.
    At December 31, 2007 and 2006, our allowance for doubtful
    accounts represented approximately 89% and 86%, respectively, of
    the $4.825 billion and $3.972 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net
    of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated
    (“pending Medicaid accounts”). Revenue days in
    accounts receivable were 53 days, 53 days and
    50 days at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Adverse changes in general economic conditions,
    patient accounting service center operations, payer mix or
    trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage
    could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows
    and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market.

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
    was $1.421 billion in 2007, $1.384 billion in 2006,
    and $1.371 billion in 2005. Buildings and improvements are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
    10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
    generally from four to 10 years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the
    respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
    deferred loan costs at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
    $652 million and $668 million, respectively, and
    accumulated amortization was $113 million and
    $54 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is included in
    interest expense and was $78 million, $18 million and
    $14 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES (Continued)

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles (Continued)

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the
    carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
    identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) expected to
    be held and used, might be impaired, we prepare projections of
    the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
    use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the
    projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
    recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value.
    Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that
    include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows,
    reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
    appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
    their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
    close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
    sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
    discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments
    of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the investments of our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as
    “available-for-sale” as defined in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and
    are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held
    for the purpose of providing the funding source to pay
    professional liability claims covered by the insurance
    subsidiary. Management performs a quarterly assessment of
    individual investment securities to determine whether declines
    in market value are temporary or other-than-temporary.
    Management’s investment securities evaluation process
    involves multiple subjective judgments, often involves
    estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a
    significant level of professional judgment in determining
    whether an impairment has occurred. We evaluate, among other
    things, the financial position and near term prospects of the
    issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of
    the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected
    future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of
    the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a
    decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost
    is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and
    extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
    amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the
    investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
    investment’s fair value, are important components of
    management’s investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
    tests. In addition to the annual impairment reviews, impairment
    reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible
    impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at
    the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below
    the business segment level, and our impairment testing is
    performed at the operating division or market level. We compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying
    amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is
    potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair
    value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value
    of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recognized. Fair value of goodwill is estimated based
    upon internal evaluations of the related long-lived assets for
    each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of
    revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar
    facilities. No goodwill impairment losses were recognized during
    2007, 2006 or 2005.

During 2007, goodwill increased by $44 million related to
    acquisitions, decreased by $45 million related to facility
    sales and increased by $29 million related to foreign
    currency translation and other adjustments. During 2006,
    goodwill increased by $38 million related to acquisitions,
    decreased by $86 million related to facility sales and
    increased by $23 million related to foreign currency
    translation and other adjustments.

Physician
    Recruiting Agreements

In order to recruit physicians to meet the needs of our
    hospitals and the communities they serve, we enter into minimum
    revenue guarantee arrangements to assist the recruited
    physicians during the period they are relocating and
    establishing their practices. In November 2005, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued FASB
    Staff Position

No. 45-3,

“Application of FASB Interpretation No. 45 to Minimum
    Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business or Its Owners”
    (“FSP

FIN 45-3”).

Under FSP

FIN 45-3,

a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the stand-ready
    obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

FSP

FIN 45-3

is effective for minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified
    on or after January 1, 2006. For periods before
    January 1, 2006, we expensed physician recruitment
    agreement amounts as the expenses to be reimbursed were incurred
    by the recruited physicians, which was generally over a
    12 month period. For post January 1, 2006 minimum
    revenue guarantees, we expense the total estimated guarantee
    liability amount at the time the physician recruiting agreement
    becomes effective. We determined that expensing the total
    estimated liability amount at the agreement effective date was
    the proper accounting treatment as we could not justify
    recording a contract-based asset based upon our analysis of the
    related control, regulatory and legal considerations.

The physician recruiting liability of $22 million and
    $14 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, represents the amount of expense recognized in
    excess of estimated payments made through December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007 the maximum
    amount of all effective, post January 1, 2006 minimum
    revenue guarantees that could be paid prospectively was
    $66 million.

Professional
    Liability Claims

A substantial portion of our professional liability risks is
    insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves
    for professional liability risks were $1.513 billion and
    $1.584 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The current portion of the reserves,
    $280 million and $275 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively, is included in “other accrued
    expenses” in the consolidated balance sheet. Provisions for
    losses related to professional liability risks were
    $163 million, $217 million and $298 million for
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included in
    “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income
    statement. Provisions for losses related to professional
    liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates.
    Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate
    net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through
    the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves
    for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using
    individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those
    estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity
    and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and
    adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new
    information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated reserve
    amounts are included in current operating results. The declining
    provision for losses trend reflects the recognition by the
    external actuaries of our improving claim frequency and severity
    trends. This improving frequency and moderating severity can be
    primarily attributed to tort reforms enacted in key states,
    particularly Texas, and our risk management and patient safety
    initiatives, particularly in the area of obstetrics. The
    reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately
    2,600 and 3,000 individual claims at December 31, 2007 and
    2006, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential
    claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can
    vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is
    settled or litigated. During 2007 and 2006, $236 million
    and $253 million, respectively, of payments (net of
    reinsurance recoveries of $5 million during each year) were
    made for professional and general liability claims. The
    estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary
    significantly. Although considerable variability is inherent in
    professional liability reserve estimates, management believes
    that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate;
    however, there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability
    will not exceed management’s estimates.

Professional
    Liability Claims (Continued)

Subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured
    retention (in place since January 1, 2007), our facilities
    are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses
    up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary
    has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks
    generally above a retention level of $15 million per
    occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance
    with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
    amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are included in
    the reserves for professional liability risks, as the insurance
    subsidiary remains liable to the extent the reinsurers do not
    meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. The
    amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts of
    $44 million and $42 million at December 31, 2007
    and 2006, respectively, are included in “other assets”
    (including $30 million and $10 million
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, included in
    “other current assets”).

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally, changes
    in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges
    are recorded in earnings, along with the changes in the fair
    value of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains
    and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the
    extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive
    income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the
    impact of the hedged items when they occur. In the event the
    forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no
    longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income is
    recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is
    terminated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not
    qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a hedge that is
    ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining term of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Minority
    Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
    entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded minority
    interests in the earnings and equity of such entities.

Recent
    Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
    establishes a generally accepted accounting principles
    (“GAAP”) framework for measuring fair value, clarifies
    the definition of fair value within that framework and expands
    disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
    SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of
    SFAS 157 to have a material effect on our financial
    position or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 159, “The Fair Value Option
    for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”
    (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 allows entities to

choose, at specified election dates, to measure many financial
    assets and financial liabilities (as well as certain
    nonfinancial instruments that are similar to financial
    instruments) at fair value. The election is made on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis and is irrevocable. If the fair value option is elected
    for an instrument, then all subsequent changes in fair value for
    that instrument should be reported in results of operations.
    SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. Differences between the amounts
    recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the
    adoption of SFAS 159 and the amounts recognized after
    adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment
    recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. We do
    not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material
    effect on our financial position or results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141(R), “Business
    Combinations” (“SFAS 141(R)”). This new
    standard will change the financial accounting and reporting of
    business combination transactions in consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS 141(R) replaces FASB Statement
    No. 141, “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141”). SFAS 141(R) retains the
    fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the acquisition
    method of accounting (which SFAS 141 called the purchase
    method) be used for all business combinations and for an
    acquirer to be identified for each business combination.
    SFAS 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains
    control of one or more businesses in the business combination
    and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the
    acquirer achieves control. The scope of SFAS 141(R) is
    broader than that of SFAS 141, which applied only to
    business combinations in which control was obtained by
    transferring consideration. SFAS 141(R) applies the
    acquisition method to all transactions and other events in which
    one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.
    SFAS 141(R) is effective for business combination
    transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the
    beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or
    after December 15, 2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of
    ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). This new
    standard will change the financial accounting and reporting of
    noncontrolling (or minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare
    consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit
    organizations. SFAS 160 amends certain of ARB 51’s
    consolidation procedures to provide consistency with the
    requirements of SFAS 141(R). SFAS 160 is required to
    be adopted concurrently with SFAS 141(R) and is effective
    for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 will require retroactive
    restatement to provide for consistent presentation of
    noncontrolling interests for all periods presented. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 160.

MERGER
    AND RECAPITALIZATION

On July 24, 2006, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
    Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Hercules Holding
    II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Hercules
    Holding”), and Hercules Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
    corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hercules Holding
    (“Merger Sub”). Our board of directors approved the
    Merger Agreement on the unanimous recommendation of a special
    committee comprised entirely of disinterested directors. The
    Merger was approved by a majority of HCA’s shareholders at
    a special meeting of shareholders held on November 16, 2006.

On November 17, 2006, pursuant to the terms of the Merger
    Agreement, the Investors consummated the acquisition of the
    Company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
    Company. The Company was the surviving corporation in the
    Merger. At December 31, 2007, 97.5% of our common stock is
    owned directly by

Hercules Holding, with the remainder being owned by certain
    members of management of the Company. Affiliates of each of the
    Sponsors indirectly own 24.8% of the common stock of the Company
    through their ownership in Hercules Holding, and affiliates of
    the Frist Entities and certain coinvestors directly and
    indirectly own 23.1% of the common stock of the Company through
    direct ownership and through their ownership in Hercules
    Holding. On the effective date of the Merger, each outstanding
    share of HCA common stock, other than shares contributed by the
    rollover shareholders or shares owned by HCA, Merger Sub or any
    shareholders who were entitled to appraisal rights, were
    cancelled and converted into the right to receive $51.00 in
    cash. The aggregate purchase price paid for all of the equity
    securities of the Company was $20.364 billion and was
    funded by $3.782 billion of equity contributions from the
    Investors, certain members of management and certain other
    coinvestors and by incurring $19.964 billion of
    indebtedness through bank credit facilities and the issuance of
    debt securities.

The Recapitalization transactions included retaining
    $7.750 billion of the Company’s existing indebtedness,
    the retirement of $3.182 billion of the Company’s
    existing indebtedness and the payment of $745 million of
    Recapitalization related fees and expenses.

Rollover
    and Stockholder Agreements And Equity Securities with Contingent
    Redemption Rights

In connection with the Merger, the Frist Entities and certain
    members of our management entered into agreements with the
    Company and/or Hercules Holding, pursuant to which they elected
    to invest in the Company, as the surviving corporation in the
    Merger, through a rollover of employee stock options, a rollover
    of shares of common stock of the Company, or a combination
    thereof. Pursuant to the rollover agreements the Frist Entities
    and management team made rollover investments of
    $885 million and $125 million, respectively.

The stockholder agreements, among other things, contain
    agreements among the parties with respect to restrictions on the
    transfer of shares, including tag along rights and drag along
    rights, registration rights (including customary indemnification
    provisions) and other rights. Pursuant to the management
    stockholder agreements, the applicable employees can elect to
    have the Company redeem their common stock and vested stock
    options in the events of death or permanent disability, prior to
    the consummation of the initial public offering of common stock
    by the Company. At December 31, 2007, 1,513,400 common
    shares and 2,249,100 vested stock options were subject to these
    contingent redemption terms.

Management
    Agreement

Affiliates of the Investors entered into a management agreement
    with us pursuant to which such affiliates will provide us with
    management services. Under the management agreement, the
    affiliates of the Investors are entitled to receive an aggregate
    annual management fee of $15 million, which amount will
    increase annually, beginning in 2008, at a rate equal to the
    percentage increase in our “EBITDA” in the applicable
    year compared to the preceding year, and reimbursement of
    out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the provision
    of services pursuant to the agreement. The management agreement
    has an initial term expiring on December 31, 2016, provided
    that the term will be extended annually for one additional year
    unless we or the Investors provide notice to the other of their
    desire not to automatically extend the term. The management
    agreement provided that affiliates of the Investors receive
    aggregate transaction fees of $175 million in connection
    with certain services provided in connection with the Merger and
    related transactions. In addition, the management agreement
    provides that the affiliates of the Investors are entitled to
    receive a fee equal to 1% of the gross transaction value in
    connection with certain financing, acquisition, disposition, and
    change of control transactions, as well as a termination fee
    based on the net present value of future payment obligations
    under the management agreement in the event of an initial public
    offering or under certain other circumstances. The agreement
    also contains customary exculpation and indemnification
    provisions in favor of the Investors and their affiliates.

Recapitalization
    Transaction Costs

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our results of
    operations include the following expenses related to the
    Recapitalization (dollars in millions):

Compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of stock
    options and restricted stock, and other employee benefits

Consulting, legal, accounting and other transaction costs


Loss on extinguishment of debt

In addition to these amounts, approximately $77 million of

    costs were capitalized as deferred loan costs.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”),
    using the modified prospective application transition method.
    Under this method, compensation cost is recognized, beginning
    January 1, 2006, based on the requirements of
    SFAS 123(R) for all share-based awards granted after the
    effective date, and based on Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), for all awards
    granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006 that were
    unvested on the effective date. Prior to January 1, 2006,
    we applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB
    25”) and related interpretations in accounting for our
    employee stock benefit plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost
    was recognized for stock options granted under the plans because
    the exercise prices for options granted were equal to the quoted
    market prices on the option grant dates and all option grants
    were to employees or directors. Results for periods prior to
    January 1, 2006 have not been restated.

As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), income before taxes
    for 2006 was lower by $78 million ($48 million after
    tax), than if we had continued to account for share-based
    compensation under APB 25. Upon consummation of the Merger, all
    outstanding stock options (other than certain options held by
    certain rollover shareholders) became fully vested, were
    cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment
    equal to the number of shares underlying the options multiplied
    by the amount (if any) by which $51.00 exceeded the option
    exercise price. The acceleration of vesting of stock options
    resulted in the recognition of $42 million of additional
    share-based compensation expense for 2006.

Certain management holders of outstanding HCA stock options were
    permitted to retain certain of their stock options (the
    “Rollover Options”) in lieu of receiving the merger
    consideration (the amount, if any, by which $51.00 exceeded the
    option exercise price). The Rollover Options remain outstanding
    in accordance with the terms of the governing stock incentive
    plans and grant agreements pursuant to which the holder
    originally received the stock option grants. However,
    immediately after the Recapitalization, the exercise price and
    number of shares subject to the rollover option agreement were
    adjusted so that the aggregate intrinsic value for each
    applicable option holder was maintained and the exercise price
    for substantially all the options was adjusted to $12.75 per
    option. Pursuant to the rollover option agreement, 10,967,500
    prerecapitalization HCA stock options were converted into
    2,285,200 Rollover Options, of which 2,249,100 are outstanding
    and exercisable at December 31, 2007.

SFAS 123(R) requires that the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost be reported as
    a financing cash flow, rather than an operating cash flow, as
    required under prior accounting guidance. Tax benefits of
    $1 million and $97 million from tax deductions in
    excess of amounts recognized as

compensation cost were reported as financing cash flows in 2007
    and 2006, respectively, compared to $163 million being
    reported as operating cash flows for 2005.

For periods prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R),
    SFAS 123 required us to determine pro forma net income as
    if compensation cost for our employee stock option and stock
    purchase plans had been determined based upon fair values at the
    grant dates. For 2005, reported net income of
    $1.424 billion would have been reduced to
    $1.401 billion on a pro forma basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2007 we had the
    following share-based compensation plans:

    Stock Incentive Plan

In connection with the Recapitalization, the 2006 Stock
    Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Inc. and its Affiliates
    (the “2006 Plan”) was established. The 2006 Plan is
    designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth
    of the Company and its subsidiaries by attracting and retaining
    management and other personnel and key service providers and to
    motivate management personnel by means of incentives to achieve
    long range goals and further the alignment of interests of
    participants with those of our stockholders through
    opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in
    the Company. The 2006 Plan permits the granting of awards
    covering 10% of our fully diluted equity immediately after
    consummation of the Recapitalization. A portion of the options
    under the 2006 Plan vests solely based upon continued employment
    over a specific period of time, and a portion of the options
    vest based both upon continued employment over a specific period
    of time and upon the achievement of predetermined performance
    Investor return and market targets over time. We granted
    9,328,000 options under the 2006 Plan during 2007. As of
    December 31, 2007, no options granted under the 2006 Plan
    have vested, and there were 1,733,700 shares available for
    future grants under the 2006 Plan.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Prior to the Recapitalization, the HCA 2005 Equity Incentive
    Plan was the primary plan under which stock options and
    restricted stock were granted to officers, employees and
    directors. Upon consummation of the Recapitalization, all shares
    of restricted stock became fully vested, were cancelled and
    converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $51.00 per
    restricted share. During 2006 and 2005, we recognized
    $247 million and $30 million, respectively, of
    compensation costs related to restricted share grants. The
    acceleration of vesting of restricted stock resulted in the
    recognition of $201 million of the total compensation
    expense related to restricted stock for 2006.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”)

Prior to the Recapitalization, our ESPP provided an opportunity
    to purchase shares of HCA common stock at a discount (through
    payroll deductions over six-month periods) to substantially all
    employees. During 2006 and 2005, ESPP purchases of
    931,000 shares and 1,662,400 shares, respectively,
    were made. Due to the Recapitalization, the second six-month
    ESPP purchase for 2006 was cash settled. The fair value of the
    right to purchase ESPP shares was estimated using a valuation
    model with the weighted average assumptions indicated in the
    following table.

Management
    Stock Purchase Plan (“MSPP”)

Prior to the Recapitalization, our MSPP allowed eligible
    employees to defer an elected percentage (not to exceed 25%) of
    their base salaries through the purchase of restricted stock at
    a 25% discount from the average market price. Purchases of
    restricted shares were made twice a year and the shares vested
    after three years. During 2006 and 2005, MSPP purchases of
    156,600 shares and 145,600 shares, respectively, were
    made at weighted average purchase date discounted (25% discount)
    fair values of $35.77 per share and $33.22 per share,
    respectively. For the plan period July 1, 2006 through
    November 17, 2006, the MSPP was cash settled due to the
    Recapitalization. The purchase date discounted price for this
    period would have been $36.79.

grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal to
    the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. We
    use historical option exercise behavior data and other factors
    to estimate the expected term of the options. The expected term
    of the option is limited by the contractual term, and employee
    post-vesting termination behavior is incorporated in the
    historical option exercise behavior data. Compensation cost is
    recognized on the straight-line attribution method. The
    straight-line attribution method requires that total
    compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested
    portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is
    derived using historical stock price information of certain peer
    group companies for a period of time equal to the expected
    option term. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate
    yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to
    the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life
    is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held
    before it is exercised.

ACQUISITIONS
    AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2007, we received proceeds of $661 million and
    recognized a net pretax gain of $443 million
    ($272 million after tax) on the sales of three hospitals.
    We also received proceeds of $106 million and recognized a
    net pretax gain of $28 million ($18 million after tax)
    on the sales of real estate investments. During 2006, we
    received proceeds of $560 million and recognized a net
    pretax gain of $176 million ($85 million after tax) on
    the sales of nine hospitals. We also received proceeds of
    $91 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $29 million ($18 million after tax) on the sales of
    real estate investments and our equity investment in a hospital
    joint venture. During 2005, we received proceeds of
    $260 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $49 million ($19 million after tax) on the sales of
    five hospitals, and we received proceeds of $60 million and
    recognized a net pretax gain of $29 million
    ($17 million after tax) related to the sales of real estate
    investments.

During 2007 and 2005, we did not acquire any hospitals, but paid
    $32 million and $126 million, respectively, for other
    health care entities. During 2006, we paid $63 million to
    acquire three hospitals and $49 million to acquire other
    health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated
    to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
    upon their respective fair values. The purchase price paid in
    excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired
    entities aggregated $44 million, $38 million and
    $129 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
    operations of the acquired entities subsequent to the respective
    acquisition dates. The pro forma effects of the acquired
    entities on our results of operations for periods prior to the
    respective acquisition dates were not significant.

IMPAIRMENTS
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2007, we recorded a pretax charge of $24 million to
    adjust the value of a building in our Central Group to estimated
    fair value. The carrying value for a hospital closed during 2006
    was reduced to fair value of $5 million, based upon
    estimates of sales value, resulting in a pretax charge of
    $16 million that affected our Corporate and Other Group.
    During 2006 we also decided to terminate a construction project
    and incurred a pretax charge of $8 million that affected
    our Corporate and Other Group. No asset impairment charges were
    incurred during 2005.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
    on our operations or cash flows and are not expected to
    significantly impact cash flows for future periods. The
    impairment charges affected our property and equipment asset
    category.

Based on new information received in 2007, related primarily to
    tax positions taken in prior taxable periods, we reduced our
    provision for income taxes by $85 million. During 2007, we
    also recorded reductions to the provision for income taxes of
    $39 million to adjust 2006 state tax accruals to the
    amounts recorded on completed tax returns and based upon an
    analysis of the Recapitalization costs. During 2005, we
    recognized tax benefits of $48 million related to a
    favorable tax settlement regarding our divestiture of certain
    noncore business units in 1998 and 2001 and $24 million
    related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.

The tax benefits associated with share-based compensation
    decreased the current tax payable by $1 million in 2007 and
    increased the current tax receivable by $97 million and
    $163 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Such benefits
    were recorded as increases to stockholders’ equity.

At December 31, 2007, state net operating loss
    carryforwards (expiring in years 2008 through
    2027) available to offset future taxable income
    approximated $106 million. Utilization of net operating
    loss carryforwards in any one year may be limited and, in
    certain cases, result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Net
    deferred tax assets related to such carryforwards are not
    significant.

We are currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
    Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) certain claimed
    deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection
    with its examination of the 2001 and 2002 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and 15 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). We expect the IRS will complete its
    examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns for
    HCA and 19 affiliated partnerships during the first quarter of
    2008 and intend to contest certain claimed deficiencies and
    adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection with these audits
    before the IRS Appeals Division.

The disputed items pending before the IRS Appeals Division for
    2001 and 2002, or proposed by the IRS Examination Division for
    2003 and 2004, include the deductibility of a portion of the
    2001 and 2003 government settlement payments, the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2001 through
    2004, the method for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful
    accounts in 2002 through 2004, and the amount of insurance
    expense deducted in 2001 and 2002.

Thirty-two taxable periods of HCA, its predecessors,
    subsidiaries and affiliated partnerships ended in 1987 through
    2000, for which the primary remaining issue is the computation
    of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are pending before
    the IRS Examination Division or the United States Tax Court as
    of December 31, 2007. HCA, its predecessors and
    subsidiaries are also subject to examination in approximately
    36 states for taxable periods ended in 1987 through 2007.
    Our international operations are subject to examination by
    United Kingdom taxing authorities for taxable periods from 2004
    through 2007 and by Swiss taxing authorities for taxable periods
    from 2002 through 2007.

The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns for HCA during the first quarter of 2008. We expect the
    IRS will open examinations of the 2005 and 2006 federal income
    tax returns for one or more affiliated partnerships during 2008.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 creates a
    single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and
    clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
    minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet
    before being recognized in the financial statements. It also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure and transition. FIN 48 applies to all tax
    positions related to income taxes subject to FASB Statement
    No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” Interest
    expense of $17 million related to taxing authority
    examinations is included in the provision for income taxes for
    the year ended December 31, 2007.

Differences of $38 million between the amounts recognized
    in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of
    FIN 48 and the amounts recognized after adoption were
    recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment, decreasing our
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits and increasing the
    balance of our retained earnings as of January 1, 2007.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our
    unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions):

Unrecognized tax benefits of $271 million, plus accrued interest
    of $218 million, as of December 31, 2007, would affect the
    effective tax rate, if realized. Our liability for unrecognized
    tax benefits was $760 million and $828 million,
    including accrued interest of $209 million and
    $218 million and excluding $4 million and $12 million that
    were recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets,
    as of January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007,
    respectively. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits does
    not reflect deferred tax assets related to the deductibility of
    interest and state taxes included therein or a $215 million
    refundable deposit that we made in 2006, which is recorded in
    noncurrent assets.

Depending on the resolution of the IRS disputes, the completion

    possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve
    months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range
    of any possible change.

Interest
    Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
    agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
    interest payments between two parties based on common notional
    principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate
    swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate
    instruments to fixed interest rate obligations. The net interest
    payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements,
    generally match the timing of the related liabilities. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis.

    Pound) of the parties executing the trade. In order to better
    match the cash flows of our obligations and intercompany
    transactions with cash flows from operations, we entered into
    various cross currency swaps. Our credit risk related to these
    agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are
    with creditworthy financial institutions.

    consisting of a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.857 billion available at December 31, 2007 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($2.638 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2007), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    ($8.712 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2007) and a €1.0 billion European term loan
    (€663 million, or $967 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2007) under which one of our European
    subsidiaries is the borrower.

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to, as determined by the type of
    borrowing, either an applicable margin plus, at our option,
    either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the
    higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus


/


of 1% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or
    (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the
    relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable
    margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior
    secured credit facilities, with the exception of term loan B
    where the margin is static, may be reduced subject to attaining
    certain leverage ratios. On February 16, 2007, we amended
    the cash flow credit facility to reduce the applicable margins
    with respect to the term loan borrowings thereunder. On
    June 20, 2007, we amended the ABL credit facility to reduce
    the applicable margin effective January 1, 2008, with
    respect to borrowings thereunder.

The ABL facility and the $2.000 billion revolving credit
    facility portion of the cash flow credit facility expire
    November 2012. We began making required, quarterly installment
    payments on each of the term loan facilities during March 2007.
    The final payment under term loan A is in November 2012. The
    final payments under term loan B and the European term loan are
    in November 2013. The senior secured credit facilities contain a
    number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain
    exceptions, our (and some or all of our subsidiaries’)
    ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated
    indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make
    investments,

loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with
    affiliates, pay dividends and distributions, and enter into sale
    and leaseback transactions. In addition, we are required to
    satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant
    under the cash flow facility and, in certain situations under
    the ABL credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio
    covenant.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the floating rate
    exposure of our debt portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2006,
    we entered into two interest rate swap agreements, in a total
    notional amount of $8 billion, in order to hedge a portion
    of our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated
    with the senior secured credit facility. The interest rate swaps
    expire in November 2011. The effect of the interest rate swaps
    is reflected in the effective interest rate for the senior
    secured credit facilities.

Senior
    Secured Notes

In November 2006, we issued $4.200 billion of senior
    secured notes (comprised of $1.000 billion of


/


% notes
    due 2014 and $3.200 billion of


/


% notes
    due 2016), and $1.500 billion of


/


% senior
    secured toggle notes (which allow us, at our option, to pay
    interest in-kind during the first five years) due 2016, which
    are subject to certain standard covenants.

Significant
    2006 Financing Activities

Proceeds from the senior secured credit facilities and the
    senior secured notes were used in connection with the closing of
    the Recapitalization. Amounts owed under our previous bank
    credit agreements were repaid at the close of the
    Recapitalization. In connection with the Recapitalization, we
    also tendered for all amounts outstanding under the
    8.85% notes due 2007, the 7.00% notes due 2007, the
    7.25% notes due 2008, the 5.25% notes due 2008 and the
    5.50% notes due 2009 (collectively, the “Notes”).
    Approximately 97% of the $1.365 billion total outstanding
    amount under the Notes was repurchased pursuant to the tender.

In February 2006, we issued $1.000 billion of
    6.5% notes due 2016. Proceeds were used to refinance
    amounts outstanding under a bank term loan and to pay down
    amounts advanced under a prior bank revolving credit facility.

General
    Information

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all
    existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material
    domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted
    Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16,
    1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only
    guarantee and pledge their assets under our ABL credit
    facility). In addition, borrowings under the European term loan
    are guaranteed by all material, wholly-owned European
    subsidiaries.

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2009 through 2012 are
    $400 million, $1.506 billion, $1.091 billion and
    $4.097 billion, respectively.

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was
    $26.127 billion and $28.096 billion at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, compared to
    carrying amounts aggregating $27.308 billion and
    $28.408 billion, respectively. The estimates of fair value
    are generally based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.

CONTINGENCIES

Significant
    Legal Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse affect on our results of operations or financial
    position in a given period.

In 2005, the Company and certain of its executive officers and
    directors were named in various federal securities law class
    actions and several shareholders filed derivative lawsuits
    purportedly on behalf of the Company. Additionally, a former
    employee filed a complaint against certain of our executive
    officers pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
    (“ERISA”), and the Company was served with a
    shareholder demand letter addressed to our Board of Directors.
    The securities and derivative actions have been settled. We have
    also reached an agreement in principle to settle the ERISA
    action, subject to court approval.

In connection with the Merger, eight asserted class action
    lawsuits related to the Merger were filed against us, certain of
    our executive officers, our directors and the Sponsors, and one
    lawsuit was filed against us and one of our affiliates seeking
    enforcement of contractual obligations allegedly arising from
    the Merger. These lawsuits have all been settled.

General
    Liability Claims

We are subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
    staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may
    seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by
    insurance. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate
    resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will
    not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial position.

Investigations

In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
    Services. Violation or breach of the CIA, or violation of
    federal or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar
    programs, could subject us to substantial monetary fines, civil
    and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs. Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or
    through private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed
    against us as a result of such actions could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Capital
    Stock

In connection with the Recapitalization, the Company’s
    certificate of incorporation and by-laws were amended and
    restated, effective November 17, 2006, so that they read,
    in their entirety, as the certificate of incorporation and
    by-laws of Merger Sub read immediately prior to the effective
    time of the Merger. Among other things, the restated certificate
    of incorporation reduced the number of shares of common stock
    the Company is authorized to issue from
    1,650,000,000 shares to 125,000,000 shares and the
    amended and restated by-laws set the number of directors
    constituting the board of directors of the Company at not less
    than one nor more than 15.

Stock
    Repurchase Programs

In October 2005, we announced the authorization of a modified
    “Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
    $2.500 billion of our common stock. In November 2005, we
    closed the tender offer and repurchased 28.7 million shares
    of our common stock for $1.437 billion ($50.00 per share).

approximately 6% of our outstanding shares at the time of the
    tender offer. During 2005, we also repurchased 8.0 million
    shares of our common stock for $412 million, through open
    market purchases. During 2006, we repurchased 13.0 million
    shares of our common stock for $651 million, through open
    market purchases, which completed this authorization.

During 2006 and 2005, the share repurchase transactions reduced
    stockholders’ equity by $653 million and
    $1.856 billion, respectively.

NOTE 12 —

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain noncontributory, defined contribution retirement
    plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits are
    determined as a percentage of a participant’s salary and
    vest over specified periods of employee service. Retirement plan
    expense was $203 million for 2007, $190 million for
    2006 and $210 million for 2005. Amounts approximately equal
    to retirement plan expense are funded annually.

We maintain contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
    that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
    requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match
    specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain
    maximum levels (generally 50% of the first 3% of compensation
    deferred by participants). The cost of these plans totaled
    $86 million for 2007, $71 million for 2006 and
    $60 million for 2005. Our contributions are funded
    periodically during each year.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
    to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the
    value of a prescribed life annuity from the combination of the
    SERP and our other benefit plans. Compensation expense under the
    plan was $20 million for 2007, $15 million for 2006
    and $9 million for 2005. Accrued benefits liabilities under
    this plan totaled $109 million at December 31, 2007
    and $107 million at December 31, 2006.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from
    certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Compensation
    expense under these plans was $27 million for 2007,
    $31 million for 2006, and $29 million for 2005.
    Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled
    $48 million at December 31, 2007 and $79 million
    at December 31, 2006.

Adoption
    of Statement 158

During September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)”
    (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires an entity
    to: recognize in its balance sheet an asset for a defined
    benefit postretirement plan’s overfunded status or a
    liability for a plan’s underfunded status; measure a
    defined benefit postretirement plan’s assets and
    obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of
    the employer’s fiscal year; and recognize changes in the
    funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in
    comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. On
    December 31, 2006, we adopted the recognition and
    disclosure provisions of SFAS 158. On January 1, 2008,
    we adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS 158. We
    do not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a
    material effect on our financial position or results of
    operations. SFAS 158 required us to recognize the funded
    status (the difference between the fair value of plan assets and
    the projected benefit obligations) of our defined benefit plans
    in the December 31, 2006 consolidated balance sheet, with a
    corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax. The adjustment to accumulated other
    comprehensive income at adoption represents the unrecognized
    actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. In
    periods subsequent to December 31, 2006, these amounts are
    being recognized as components of net periodic pension cost.

SEGMENT
    AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals
    and related health care entities. During the years ended
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 24%, 26%
    and 27%, respectively, of our revenues related to patients
    participating in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program.

Our operations are structured into three geographically
    organized groups: the Eastern Group includes 49 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Eastern United States, the Central
    Group includes 52 consolidating hospitals located in the Central
    United States and the Western Group includes 54 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Western United States. We also operate
    six consolidating hospitals in England, and these facilities are
    included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
    and amortization, interest expense, gains on sales of
    facilities, impairment of long-lived assets, transaction costs,
    minority interests and income taxes. We use adjusted segment
    EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating
    resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance.
    Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical
    indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a
    measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted
    segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of
    financial performance under generally accepted accounting
    principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA
    are significant components in understanding and assessing
    financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a
    measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying
    calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be
    comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
    companies. The geographic distributions of our revenues, equity
    in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA, depreciation
    and amortization, assets and goodwill are summarized in the

    (Continued)

NOTE 16 —

SUPPLEMENTAL
    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER
    COLLATERAL-RELATED INFORMATION (Continued)

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company
    (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA
    Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as
    collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior
    secured notes described in Note 9.

Rule 3-16

of

Regulation S-X

under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate
    financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose
    securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral
    for any class of securities registered or being registered. We
    believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to
    Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral
    for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure
    relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating
    subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust.
    The corporate structure relationship, combined with the
    application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s
    consolidated financial statements related to HCA’s debt and
    financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial
    statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the
    consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated
    financial statements of HCA and Healthtrust present the
    identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets,
    liabilities, total stockholders’ (deficit) equity, net cash
    provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing
    activities and net cash used in financing activities. Certain
    individual line items in the HCA consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows are combined
    into one line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of
    stockholder’s (deficit) equity and cash flows.

Reconciliations of the HCA Inc. Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity and Consolidated Statements
    of Cash Flows presentations to the Healthtrust, Inc. —

    Stockholder’s (Deficit) Equity and Consolidated Statements
