PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading health
care services companies in the United States. At December 31, 2013, we operated 165 hospitals, comprised of 159 general, acute care hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. In addition, we operated 115
freestanding surgery centers. Our facilities are located in 20 states and England.

The terms
“Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization (as defined
below) and to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the Corporate Reorganization. The term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
partners. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA, and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of quality health care services in the most cost-effective
manner possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as
diagnostic and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored
by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners and HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. (collectively, the “Investors”) and by members of management and certain other investors. The
transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and liabilities.

During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87,719,300 shares of our common stock. Certain of our stockholders also sold 57,410,700 shares of our common stock in this
offering. During December 2012, February 2013 and November 2013, certain Investors sold 32,000,000 shares, 50,000,000 shares and 30,000,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the
selling stockholders in any of these offerings. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “HCA”).

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and our
telephone number is (615) 344-9551.

Corporate Reorganization

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a new holding company structure (the “Corporate
Reorganization”). We are the parent company, and HCA Inc. is our 100% owned direct subsidiary. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of capital stock were automatically converted, on a share for share
basis, into identical shares of our common stock. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, we are deemed the successor registrant to HCA Inc. under the Exchange Act. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, we became a guarantor but did not
assume the debt of HCA Inc.’s outstanding secured notes.



Following the Corporate Reorganization, the right to receive HCA Inc.’s
common stock under its various compensation plans and agreements automatically converted into rights for the same number of shares of our common stock, with the same rights and conditions as the corresponding HCA Inc. rights prior to the Corporate
Reorganization.

Available Information

We file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including annual reports on
Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549.
The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. We are an electronic filer, and the SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains the reports, proxy and

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while
growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:

•

grow our presence in existing markets;

•

achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures;

•

recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services;

•

continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and

•

selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate
hospitals; freestanding surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2013, we owned and operated 159 general, acute care hospitals with 42,240 licensed beds. Most of our
general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as
outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical research and education programs. However, some of our
hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other education programs.



At December 31, 2013, we operated five psychiatric hospitals with 556
licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers
(“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and various other facilities. These
outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each
partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply contracts; equipment
purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental reimbursement assistance; construction planning and coordination; information technology systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resources services; and
internal audit services.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.

We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under
their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues from third-party payers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are summarized in the
following table (dollars in millions):

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical
benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals



located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established
hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established
charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans,
including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”). These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, “Business —
Competition.” Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but are
responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more
difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care under our charity care policy. These discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed
care plans. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these
programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the
“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. These automatic spending
reductions began on March 1, 2013, with CMS imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims beginning on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2024.

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we
receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the
patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis.
MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS
reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional
“outlier” payments.

MS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using
cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health
care industry in purchasing goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), provides for annual decreases
to the market basket, including the following reductions for each of the following federal fiscal years: 0.3% in 2014; 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the
annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019. The American Taxpayer
Relief Act of 2012 requires a negative



documentation and coding adjustment for four years beginning in federal fiscal year 2014. It is estimated that this documentation and coding adjustment will reduce Medicare inpatient PPS payments
by $10.5 billion. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.

For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 2.8%. This increase reflected a 2.6% market basket increase, the 0.1% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.7%
productivity adjustment, a negative 1.9% prospective documentation and coding adjustment and a positive 2.9% retrospective documentation and coding adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS issued a final rule that results in a net increase of
0.7%. This increase reflects a 2.5% market basket increase, the 0.3% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, a negative 0.8% prospective documentation and coding adjustment and a negative 0.2% adjustment
to offset projected spending increases associated with new admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the “two midnight rule.” Under the rule, Medicare beneficiaries are only to be admitted as inpatients
when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Compliance with the two midnight rule was required beginning October 1, 2013 and will
become subject to Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) audits beginning October 1, 2014.

CMS has
implemented or is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals receive a 2% reduction to their market basket
updates if they fail to submit data for patient care quality indicators to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that do not participate will lose an
additional one-quarter of the percentage increase in their payment updates. All of our hospitals paid under the Medicare inpatient PPS are participating in the quality initiative by submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor to
comply with all data submission requirements as additional requirements continue to be added, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle all of our hospitals to the full market basket adjustment.

Further, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected
hospital acquired condition (“HAC”) was not present on admission. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 11 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS
has established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The Health Reform Law provides for reduced payments based on a
hospital’s HAC rates. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments.

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Beginning in federal
fiscal year 2013 and continuing in each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia
or other conditions that may be designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the
excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospital’s performance for each condition using three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established
by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions was capped at 1% for federal fiscal year 2013, but this reduction increased to 2% for federal fiscal year 2014, and will increase to 3% for federal fiscal year 2015 and
thereafter. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

The Health Reform Law additionally
establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link payments to quality and efficiency. For each federal fiscal year, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by the following: 1.25% for 2014; 1.5% for
2015; 1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to



reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative
to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater
reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored based on a weighted
average of patient experience scores using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and certain clinical measures. In federal fiscal year 2014, there are 17 measures by which hospitals will be scored. CMS estimates
that it will distribute $1.1 billion in federal fiscal year 2014 to hospitals under the value-based purchasing program.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS established an outlier threshold of $21,821, and for
federal fiscal year 2014, CMS reduced the outlier threshold to $21,748. We do not anticipate that the decrease to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2014 will have a material impact on our results of operations.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for
physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing
facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment
classifications (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC
for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. The Health Reform Law provides for reductions to the market basket update, including the following reductions for each of the following calendar years: 0.3% in 2014; 0.2%
in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in
specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the outpatient PPS by $26.3 billion from 2010 to 2019. For calendar
year 2013, CMS increased APC payment rates by 1.8%, which represented the full market basket update of 2.6%, a negative 0.7% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.1% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. For calendar year 2014, CMS has
issued a final rule that increases the APC payment rate by 1.7%, which includes the full market basket update of 2.5%, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.3% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. CMS requires hospitals
to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient
rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers) and functional
capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law also provides for
reductions to the market basket update, including the following reductions for each of the following federal fiscal years: 0.3% in 2014; 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law
provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving



average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments
under the IRF PPS by $5.7 billion from 2010 to 2019. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS updated inpatient rehabilitation rates by 1.9%, which reflected a 2.7% market basket increase, a negative 0.7% productivity adjustment and a 0.1% reduction
required by the Health Reform Law. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS has issued a final rule updating inpatient rehabilitation rates by 1.8%, which reflects a 2.6% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and a 0.3% reduction
required by the Health Reform Law. In addition, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, IRFs are required to report quality measures to CMS or they will receive a 2% reduction to the market basket update.

In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent
12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to
pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under the
acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2013, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 48 hospital rehabilitation units.

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed under a prospective payment system (the
“IPF PPS”), a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base
payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care market basket update is used to update the IPF
PPS. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including the following reductions for the following federal fiscal years: 0.1% in 2014; 0.3% in 2015, 0.2% in 2016 and 2017 and 0.75% in 2018, 2019 and 2020. For
each payment year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of
enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the IPF PPS by $4.3 billion from 2010 to 2019. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment
rates by 1.9%, including a market basket increase of 2.7%, reduced by a 0.7% productivity adjustment and a reduction of 0.1% as required by the Health Reform Law. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS has increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by
2%, including a market basket increase of 2.6%, reduced by a 0.5% productivity adjustment and 0.1% as required by the Health Reform Law. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, inpatient psychiatric facilities will be required to report quality
measures to CMS or will receive a 2% reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2013, we had five psychiatric hospitals and 45 hospital psychiatric units.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ASCs
using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines
that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical
procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more
Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be



moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be
reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2014, CMS has issued a final rule that provides for a 1.2% annual update to ASC payments, which
includes the market basket update of 1.7% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has also established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures will receive a 2%
reduction in reimbursement.

Physician Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (“PFS”) system, under which CMS has assigned
a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a
combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a
geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. The aggregated amount is multiplied by a conversion factor that accounts for inflation and targeted growth in Medicare expenditures (as calculated by the
sustainable growth rate (“SGR”)) to arrive at the payment amount for each service. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments
made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made.

The PFS rates are adjusted each year, and reductions in both current and future payments are anticipated. The SGR formula, if implemented as mandated by statute, would result in significant reductions to
payments under the PFS. These reductions are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2014. Since 2003, the U.S. Congress has passed multiple legislative acts delaying application of the SGR to the PFS. The most recent legislative delay provided a
0.5% increase in payment rates through March 31, 2014. The Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently agreed upon legislation that, if enacted, will discontinue use of the
SGR formula, thereby eliminating the scheduled payment reductions. The legislation would also provide an annual payment increase of 0.5% beginning in 2014 and extending through 2018 and would maintain 2018 rates through 2023. In addition, the
legislation would require CMS to transition physician payments to a more value-based model beginning in 2018.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor
(“wage index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes, while slightly negative in the
aggregate, is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2014. Based on the Health Reform Law’s mandate, HHS submitted recommendations on reform to the Medicare wage index system, but Congress has not yet acted on the proposed
reforms.

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance
amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Jobs Creation Act of 2012 (the “Jobs Creation Act”) reduced the percentage of bad debt amounts that Medicare reimburses from 70% to 65%. These
reductions were intended to offset, in part, the impact of the legislative delay of the SGR reductions in physician compensation under the PFS. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address the SGR reductions, but has not yet enacted it
into law.

As required by the MMA, CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the
Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given



jurisdiction. CMS awarded initial contracts to all 15 MAC jurisdictions, but CMS is currently engaged in a consolidation strategy to move from 15 MAC jurisdictions to 10. While chain providers
had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a
result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow.

Under the RAC program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. CMS has implemented
the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis as required by statute. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of
overpayments and underpayments they identify.

Historically, RACs have conducted their reviews on a
post-payment basis. However, CMS has also established the Recovery Audit Prepayment Review (“RAPR”) demonstration, that allows RACs to perform prepayment reviews. Under the RAPR demonstration, RACs conduct prepayment reviews on certain
types of claims that historically result in high rates of improper payments, beginning with claims for short stay inpatient hospital services. These reviews focus on seven states (Florida, California, Michigan, Texas, New York, Louisiana and
Illinois) with high populations of fraud and error-prone providers and four states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Missouri) with high claims volumes of short inpatient hospital stays. The RAPR demonstration began in 2012 and runs for a
three year period.

We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment
denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We are incurring additional costs related
to responding to RAC requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Amounts that have
not been reversed upon appeal have not been significant, but the number and amount of claims subject to RAC review has been steadily increasing, and we expect this trend to continue. Further, HHS has suspended the assignment of new Medicare appeals
to Administrative Law Judges for at least two years beginning July 16, 2013, so that HHS may work through a backlog of appeals. Thus, we will experience a significant delay in appealing any RAC payment denials that occur during the suspension
period. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Managed Medicare

Under the Managed Medicare program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans
can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries to choose enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. MMA increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and expanded Medicare
beneficiaries’ health care options. The Health Reform Law reduces, over a three year period starting in 2012, premium payments to managed Medicare plans such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments are, on average, equal to
traditional Medicare. In addition, the Health Reform Law requires managed Medicare plans to keep annual administrative costs lower than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law also implements fee payment adjustments based on service
benchmarks and quality ratings. The Congressional Budget Office (“CBO”) has estimated that, as a result of these changes, payments to plans will be reduced by $138 billion between 2010 and 2019, while CMS has estimated the reduction
to be $145 billion. In addition, the Health Reform Law expands the RAC program to include managed Medicare plans. In light of the current economic environment and the Health Reform Law, managed Medicare plans may experience reduced premium
payments from CMS, which may lead to increased beneficiary premiums or limits on benefits which, in turn, may cause decreased enrollment in such plans.



Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under
approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. Although the Health Reform
Law requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (“FPL”) by 2014, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid
funding. For those states that expand Medicaid coverage, the Health Reform Law requires states to apply a “5% income disregard” to the Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will effectively be extended to those with
incomes up to 138% of the FPL. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. It is unclear how many states will ultimately decline
to implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law.

Because most states must operate with balanced
budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic environment has increased the
budgetary pressures on most states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states.

Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid
programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid
systems. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for children until October 1, 2019.

Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat
certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by
the state.

Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse
in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In
addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the MIC program and expands the RAC program’s scope to include Medicaid claims
by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers.

Managed
Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient
enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities,
usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in
managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these
plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans.

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment
Initiatives

Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program
(“MSSP”) that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations



(“ACOs”). The program allows certain providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) to voluntarily form ACOs and work together along
with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational
efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of the program. Participants may
choose between two different ACO tracks, the first of which allows ACOs to share only in the savings under the MSSP. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and losses under the MSSP but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings
realized under the MSSP. As authorized by the Health Reform Law, certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. CMS has approved over 300 ACOs to participate in the MSSP.

The Health Reform Law created the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation with responsibility for establishing
demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality
of care. One initiative announced by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation is a voluntary bundled payment initiative involving over 400 participants that links payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode
of care. As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS established a separate five-year, voluntary, national pilot program on payment bundling for Medicare services. Under the program, organizations enter into payment arrangements that include financial
and performance accountability for episodes of care, and these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Participating providers agree to receive one payment for services provided
to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. The Health Reform Law also provides for a bundled payment demonstration project for Medicaid services, but CMS has not yet implemented this project. HHS may select up to eight
states to participate, and these state programs may target particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs will provide one payment for both hospital and physician services
provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of inpatient care.

Disproportionate Share Hospital
Payments

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes
additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). DSH payments are determined annually based on certain statistical
information required by HHS and are calculated as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments.

Under the Health
Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments are reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively
pooled, and this pool will be reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured nationally, the more the
Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is then to be paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. In 2013, CMS issued final rules to implement
these reductions.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may
receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define
which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, provides for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2016
through 2020 by the following amounts: 2016 ($1.2 billion); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020 ($4 billion). The Jobs Creation Act, the



American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provide for additional Medicaid DSH reductions in federal fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 estimated at $4.1 billion,
$4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. CMS has issued a final rule establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. States largely
retain the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health
care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to
that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.

Annual cost reports required
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the
final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 30%, 30%, and 31% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 4% to 6% from managed care payers during 2013, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate
reimbursement increases or the impact of plans offered through the Exchanges on us.

Uninsured and Self-Pay
Patients

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 83% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. The Health Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. Further, the Health
Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives, most of which



became effective on January 1, 2014, for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. These mandates may reduce the financial impact of screening for and
stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, many factors are unknown regarding the impact of the Health Reform Law, including how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the law, the change, if any, in the
volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals, any changes to the payer mix and any increases in plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts.

Electronic Health Record Incentives

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive
payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology and provides for penalties for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that do not
adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. Through December 2013, approximately $19 billion in incentive payments have been made through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals.

Under the Medicare incentive program, eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use will receive incentive payments
for up to four fiscal years. The Medicare incentive payment amount is the product of three factors: (1) an initial amount comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000, plus $200 for each acute care inpatient discharge, beginning with a
hospital’s 1,150th discharge of the applicable year and ending with a hospital’s 23,000th discharge of the applicable year; (2) the “Medicare share,” which is the sum of Medicare Part A and Part C acute care
inpatient-bed-days divided by the product of the total acute care inpatient-bed-days and a charity care factor; and (3) a transition factor applicable to the payment year. In order to maximize their incentive payments, acute care hospitals must
have begun participating in the incentive program by federal fiscal year 2013. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, acute care hospitals that have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting
period will receive reduced market basket updates under inpatient PPS.

Eligible professionals who demonstrate
meaningful use are entitled to incentive payments for up to five payment years in an amount equal to 75% of their estimated Medicare allowed charges for covered professional services furnished during the relevant calendar year, subject to an annual
limit. Eligible professionals must have begun participating in the incentive payment program by calendar year 2012 in order to maximize their incentive payments and must participate by calendar year 2014 in order to receive any incentive payments.
Beginning in calendar year 2015, eligible professionals who have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period will face Medicare payment reductions.

The Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntary for states to implement. For participating states, the Medicaid EHR
incentive program provides incentive payments for acute care hospitals and eligible professionals that meet certain volume percentages of Medicaid patients, as well as children’s hospitals. Providers may only participate in a single
state’s Medicaid EHR incentive program. Eligible professionals can only participate in either the Medicaid incentive program or the Medicare incentive program and can change this election only one time. Eligible hospitals may participate in
both the Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs.

To qualify for incentive payments under the Medicaid
program, providers must either adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology during their first participation year or successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in subsequent
participation years. Payments may be received for up to six participation years. For hospitals, the aggregate Medicaid EHR incentive amount is the product of two factors: (1) the overall EHR amount, which is comprised of a base amount of
$2,000,000 plus a discharge-related amount, multiplied by the Medicare share (which is set at one by statute) multiplied by a transition factor, and (2) the “Medicaid share,” which is the estimated Medicaid inpatient-bed days plus
estimated Medicaid managed care inpatient bed-days, divided by the product of the estimated total inpatient bed-days and a charity care factor. Under the Medicaid incentive program, eligible professionals may



receive payments based on their EHR costs, up to a total amount of $63,750, or for pediatricians, $42,500. There is no penalty for hospitals or professionals under Medicaid for failing to meet
EHR meaningful use requirements.

Hospital Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions
and market penetration of managed care programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics
for our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months. The data set forth in this
table includes only those facilities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

(a)

Excludes eight facilities in 2010 and 2009 that were not consolidated (accounted for using the equity method) for financial reporting purposes.

(b)

Excludes one facility in 2012 and 2011, nine facilities in 2010 and eight facilities in 2009 that were not consolidated (accounted for using the
equity method) for financial reporting purposes.

(c)

Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency.

(d)

Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned.

(e)

Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient
volume.

(f)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent
admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation
“equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

(g)

Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals.

(h)

Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day.

(i)

Represents the percentage of hospital licensed beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and occupancy rate provide measures of the
utilization of inpatient rooms.



(j)

Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms.

(k)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in outpatient surgeries.

(l)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in inpatient surgeries.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our hospitals provide services similar to those
offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has
increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by
tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and
support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized
facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore,
our psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to
attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. The Health Reform Law requires
hospitals to publish annually a list of their standard charges for items and services. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients, and increased predictability
and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital
are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the
hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the
medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients.
Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models.

Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts with
purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers
continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care services purchasers on the
basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on



our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed
care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care
companies to contract with us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, as various provisions of the Health Reform Law are implemented, including the
Exchanges and limitations on rescissions of coverage and pre-existing condition exclusions, non-government payers may increasingly demand reduced fees or be unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the plans offered through the
Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. The
importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes
in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types
or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures
before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing
with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing
challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected
by payer-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by
Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or
construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and
services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to
the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission with the exception of three hospitals acquired in the third quarter of 2013 which
are accredited by Det Norske Veritas. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the
facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal,
state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.



The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities,
equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required
notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.

Certificates of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public
need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change ownership or other
penalties.

State Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital
revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in
states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by
statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospital’s participation in the federal health care
programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits
providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted
this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that
knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of a claim for
services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”).

The HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying
and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and
“Special Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the



force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other federal
health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or
significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a physician’s
office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder,
(f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for conferences, (h) coverage on the
hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician,
(j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l)
physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that
physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care providers.
These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of
giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of
risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed
protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner
recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements,
obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud
Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government
enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either
refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar
relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into



the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships
with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no
assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act
and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a
provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these
entities provide certain “designated health services” reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid
from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely
basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to
$15,000 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties
and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians
and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law
exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after
December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the
Health Reform Law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations
were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or
judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot
assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians
for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their
interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.



Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud
and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and
Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud.
Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had
no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in
excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care
program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the
Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Under the Health Reform Law, civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding
cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other
fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and in some cases may result in penalties of up to three
times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law,
especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of
at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.

The Federal False Claims Act and
Similar State Laws

The

qui tam

, or whistleblower, provisions of the FCA allow private individuals
to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. Further, the government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing
for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. The Health Reform Law expanded the scope of the FCA to cover payments in connection with the Exchanges created under the Health Reform Law, if those payments include any federal funds.
When a private party brings a

qui tam

action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined
by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many
potential bases for liability under the FCA, including knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment in a timely manner. Liability often arises
when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with
reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability.

The Health Reform Law provides that submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases,
whistleblowers



and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false
claims under the FCA. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and
whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have
adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic
data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. As required by the Health Reform
Law, HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each
provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS has also published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. Implementing the ICD-10 code sets will require
significant administrative changes. Use of the ICD-10 code sets is required beginning October 1, 2014.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of
individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to
protect the security of such information. ARRA broadened the scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In addition, ARRA extends the application of certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations to business associates
(entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities) and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. HHS has implemented many of these ARRA provisions through a final
rule that became effective March 26, 2013. The final rule subjects business associates and their subcontractors to direct liability under the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and revises the requirements for agreements with business
associates. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Compliance with the final rule was required beginning
September 23, 2013, except that existing business associate agreements may qualify for an extended compliance date of September 23, 2014.

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered
entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500
individuals. In its 2013 final rule, HHS modified this breach notification requirement by creating a presumption that all non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business
associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable
information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal
penalties, and ARRA has strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, including requiring HHS to perform compliance audits, which may result in increased enforcement activity. For example, ARRA broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty
provisions to employees of covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. In addition, ARRA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking



either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. ARRA also significantly increases the amount of the
civil penalties, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. The 2013 final rule implemented many of the ARRA enforcement requirements. In the
rule, HHS removed the requirement that HHS attempt to resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, prior to imposing penalties. Instead, HHS has the discretion to resolve
violations by moving directly to impose monetary penalties. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA
privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state
privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate
enforcement actions in response to data breaches.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss
as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The
government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a
patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the
future. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of
Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other
entities from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the
recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the
physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public
attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of



the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate
and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private
litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny
of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this
area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In
some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal
enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or
other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including $40 million in federal fiscal year 2014. In addition,
governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide
variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges
and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and
Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may
receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as
adverse publicity.

Health Care Reform

The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of
uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects
of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. Most of the provisions of the Health Reform Law that seek to
decrease the number of uninsured became effective January 1, 2014.

Expanded Coverage

Based on the CBO’s February 2014 projection, by 2022, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 25 million
additional individuals. This increased coverage will occur through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms.



Medicaid Expansion

The primary public program coverage expansion is occurring through changes in Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, expansion
of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”). The most significant changes expand the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permit individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. Although the
Health Reform Law requires, as of January 1, 2014, all state Medicaid programs to provide, and the federal government to subsidize, Medicaid coverage to virtually all adults under 65 years old with incomes at or under 133% of the federal
poverty level (“FPL”), states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. For states that expand Medicaid coverage, the Health Reform Law also requires those states to apply a “5% income
disregard” to the Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will effectively be extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. States that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion will forego funding established
by the Health Reform Law to cover most of the expansion costs. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have chosen not to participate in the expanded Medicaid program, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later
date. For states that do not participate, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. According to the CBO’s February 2014 projection, the new eligibility
requirements will expand Medicaid and CHIP coverage by an estimated 13 million persons nationwide by 2022.

As Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, the federal government provides states with “matching funds”
in a defined percentage, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (“FMAP”). Beginning in 2014, states will receive an enhanced FMAP for the individuals enrolled in Medicaid pursuant to the Health Reform Law. The FMAP percentage
is as follows: 100% for calendar years 2014 through 2016; 95% for 2017; 94% in 2018; 93% in 2019; and 90% in 2020 and thereafter. CMS has indicated that states that only partially expand their Medicaid programs will not receive an enhanced FMAP.

The Health Reform Law also provides that the federal government will subsidize states that create
non-Medicaid plans for residents whose incomes are greater than 133% of the FPL but do not exceed 200% of the FPL. Approved state plans will be eligible to receive federal funding. The amount of that funding per individual will be equal to 95% of
subsidies that would have been provided for that individual had he or she enrolled in a health plan offered through one of the Exchanges, as discussed below.

Historically, states often have attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least
maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for children until October 1, 2019.

Private Sector Expansion

The expansion of health coverage
through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law occurs through new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. Health insurers must keep their annual nonmedical costs lower than 15% of premium revenue for
the group market and lower than 20% in the small group and individual markets or rebate to enrollees the amount spent in excess of the percentage. In addition, health insurers are not permitted to deny coverage to children based upon a pre-existing
condition and must allow dependent care coverage for children up to 26 years old. As of January 1, 2014, health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing
conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage.

Larger employers will be subject to new requirements and incentives to provide health insurance benefits to their full
time employees. Employers with 50 or more employees that do not offer health insurance will be held subject to a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. The employer penalties will range from $2,000 to
$3,000 per employee, subject to certain thresholds and conditions. This requirement was originally effective January 1, 2014, but has been delayed until January 1, 2015. For employers with 50 to 99 employees, this requirement has been
further delayed until January 1, 2016.



The Health Reform Law uses various means to induce individuals who do not
have health insurance to obtain coverage. Effective January 1, 2014, individuals are required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or pay a tax penalty. The penalty in most cases is the greater of $95 or 1% of
income in 2014, $325 or 2% of income in 2015, $695 or 2.5% of income in 2016, and indexed to a cost of living adjustment in subsequent years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), in consultation with HHS, is responsible for enforcing the
tax penalty, although the Health Reform Law limits the availability of certain IRS enforcement mechanisms. In addition, for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL, the cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges will be
subsidized by the federal government. Those with lower incomes will be eligible to receive greater subsidies. It is anticipated that those at the lowest income levels will have the majority of their premiums subsidized by the federal government, in
some cases in excess of 95% of the premium amount.

To facilitate the purchase of health insurance by
individuals and small employers, the Health Reform Law mandated that each state establish or participate in an Exchange or default to a federally-operated Exchange by January 1, 2014. Based on CBO estimates issued in May 2013, approximately
24 million individuals will obtain their health insurance coverage through an Exchange by 2022. This amount will include individuals who were previously uninsured and individuals who have switched from their prior insurance coverage to a plan
obtained through an Exchange. The Health Reform Law requires that the Exchanges be designed to make the process of evaluating, comparing and acquiring coverage simple for consumers. For example, each state’s Exchange must maintain an internet
website through which consumers may access health plan ratings that are assigned by the state based on quality and price, view governmental health program eligibility requirements and calculate the actual cost of health coverage. Health insurers
participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, as defined by HHS, and may offer more benefits. Health insurers must offer at least two, and up to five, levels of plans that vary by the percentage of medical expenses that must be
paid by the enrollee. These levels are referred to as platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic plans, with gold and silver being the two mandatory levels of plans. Each level of plan must require the enrollee to share the following
percentages of medical expenses up to the deductible/copayment limit: platinum, 10%; gold, 20%; silver, 30%; bronze, 40%; and catastrophic, 100%. Health insurers may establish varying deductible/copayment levels, up to the statutory maximum ($6,250
for 2013 and $6,350 in 2014 for an individual, subject to increases in future years). The health insurers must cover 100% of the amount of medical expenses in excess of the deductible/copayment limit. For example, an individual making 100% to 200%
of the FPL will have copayments and deductibles reduced to about one-third of the amount payable by those with the same plan with incomes at or above 400% of the FPL.

Public Program Spending

The Health Reform Law provides for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care program spending reductions between 2010 and 2019. In March 2010, CMS estimated Medicare fee-for-service reductions from
2010 to 2019 would be $233 billion and the Medicare and Medicaid DSH reductions would be an additional $64 billion. In July 2012, the CBO estimated that from 2013 to 2022, the Health Reform Law reductions would include $415 billion in Medicare
fee-for-service market basket and productivity reimbursement reductions, the majority of which will come from hospitals. The CBO estimate included an additional $56 billion in reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding.

Payments for Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers

Inpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment

. Under the Medicare program, hospitals receive
reimbursement under a PPS for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. CMS establishes fixed PPS payment amounts per inpatient discharge based on the patient’s assigned MS-DRG. These MS-DRG rates are updated each federal fiscal year,
which begins October 1, using a market basket index that takes into account inflation experienced by hospitals and other entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services.



The Health Reform Law provides for three types of annual reductions in the
market basket. The first is a general reduction of a specified percentage each federal fiscal year that began in 2010 and extends through 2019. The remaining reductions are as follows: 2014 (0.3%); 2015 (0.2%); 2016 (0.2%); 2017 (0.75%); 2018
(0.75%); and 2019 (0.75%).

The second type of reduction to the market basket is a “productivity
adjustment” that was implemented by HHS beginning in federal fiscal year 2012. The amount of that reduction is the projected nationwide productivity gains over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection, HHS uses the BLS 10-year
moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS has announced a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment to the market basket. In 2010, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity
adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019.

The
third type of reduction is in connection with the value-based purchasing program discussed in more detail below. For each federal fiscal year, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by the following: 1.25% for 2014; 1.5%
for 2015; 1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. For each federal fiscal year, the total amount collected from these reductions will be pooled and used to fund payments to hospitals that satisfy certain quality metrics. While some or
all of these reductions may be recovered if a hospital satisfies these quality metrics, the recovery amounts may be delayed.

If the aggregate of the three market basket reductions described above is more than the annual market basket adjustments made to account for inflation, there will be a reduction in the MS-DRG rates paid
to hospitals.

Quality-Based Payment Adjustments and Reductions for Inpatient Services

.

The
Health Reform Law establishes or expands three provisions to promote value-based purchasing and to link payments to quality and efficiency. First, in federal fiscal year 2013, HHS was directed to implement a value-based purchasing program for
inpatient hospital services. This program rewards hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by HHS. The Health Reform Law provides HHS considerable discretion over the value-based purchasing program. Under the value-based
purchasing program for hospital inpatient services, CMS will distribute an estimated $1.1 billion in federal fiscal year 2014 to hospitals based on their overall performance on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical
processes of care and patient satisfaction. Hospitals are scored based on a weighted average of patient experience scores using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and certain clinical measures. In federal
fiscal year 2014, there are 17 measures by which hospitals will be scored. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable
measure. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards set by HHS will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they
would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. CMS published the value-based incentive payment adjustment factor for each hospital for federal fiscal
year 2014 discharges on November 14, 2013.

Second, beginning in federal fiscal year 2013 and continuing
in each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess readmissions” within the 30-day period from the date of discharge for heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions that may be
designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as “excess readmissions” for these conditions will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission
standard. The amount by which payments will be reduced if a hospital experiences excess readmissions is determined by comparison of the hospital’s readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average and is subject to a cap established
by CMS. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

Third, reimbursement will be reduced
based on a facility’s HAC rates. A HAC is a condition that is acquired by a patient while admitted as an inpatient in a hospital, such as a surgical site infection. Beginning in federal



fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments. In
addition, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs. CMS implemented this prohibition for services with dates beginning July 1, 2012.
States may add additional provider-preventable conditions to the list of HACs for which Medicaid reimbursement will not be allowed.

Outpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment

.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into APCs. The APC payment rates are updated each calendar year based on
the market basket. The first two market basket changes outlined above — the general reduction and the productivity adjustment — apply to outpatient services as well as inpatient services, although these are applied on a calendar
year basis. The percentage changes specified in the Health Reform Law summarized above as the general reduction for inpatients — e.g., 0.2% in 2015 — are the same for outpatients.

Medicare and Medicaid DSH Payments

.

The Medicare DSH program provides for additional payments to
hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments are reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The
remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively pooled, and this pool will be reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years
of age. In other words, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each hospital is then paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its level
of uncompensated care, which was not the basis for DSH payments prior to implementation of the Health Reform Law. In 2013, CMS issued final rules to implement these reductions.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments.
The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. Although federal Medicaid law defines some level of hospitals that must
receive Medicaid DSH funding, states have broad discretion to define additional hospitals that also may qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013,
provides for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2016 through 2020 by the following amounts: 2016 ($1.2 billion); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020
($4 billion). The Jobs Creation Act and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provide for additional Medicaid DSH reductions in federal fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 estimated at $4.1 billion, $4.2
billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. CMS has issued a final rule establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. States largely
retain the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state.

ACOs

.

Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, HHS established the MSSP, which seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. The MSSP allows certain
providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) to voluntarily form ACOs and work together along with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve
high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a
portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. Participants may choose between two different ACO tracks, the first of which allows ACOs to share only in the savings under the MSSP. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and
losses under the MSSP but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings realized under the MSSP. As authorized by the Health Reform Law, certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. CMS has approved over 300 ACOs to participate in
the MSSP.



Bundled Payment Pilot Programs

.

The Health Reform Law
created the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation with responsibility for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for
health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality of care. One initiative announced by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation is a voluntary bundled payment initiative involving over 400
participants that will link payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. In addition, as required by the Health Reform Law, HHS established a five-year, voluntary, national pilot program on payment bundling
for Medicare services. Under the program, organizations may enter into payment arrangements that include financial and performance accountability for episodes of care, and these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at
a lower cost to the Medicare program. Participating providers agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. HHS has discretion to determine how the program will function,
including what medical conditions will be included in the program and the amount of the payment for each condition. The Health Reform Law also provides for a five-year bundled payment pilot program for Medicaid services, but CMS has not yet
implemented this program. HHS may select up to eight states to participate based on the potential to lower costs under the Medicaid program while improving care. State programs may target particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or
geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs will provide one payment for both hospital and physician services provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of inpatient care. For both pilot programs, HHS will determine the
relationship between the programs and restrictions in certain existing laws, including the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the HIPAA privacy, security and transaction standard requirements. However, the
Health Reform Law does not authorize HHS to waive other laws that may impact the ability of hospitals and other eligible participants to participate in the pilot programs, such as antitrust laws.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

.

The Health Reform Law reduces reimbursement for ASCs through a
productivity adjustment to the market basket similar to the productivity adjustment for inpatient and outpatient hospital services. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on
required quality measures will receive a 2% reduction in reimbursement beginning with the calendar year 2014 payment determination.

Medicare Managed Care (Medicare Advantage or “MA”)

.

Under the MA program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide inpatient and outpatient
benefits to beneficiaries who enroll in such plans. In 2013, approximately 14.4 million Medicare beneficiaries elected to enroll in MA plans. Effective in 2014, the Health Reform Law requires MA plans to keep annual administrative costs lower
than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law reduces, over a three year period starting in 2012, premium payments to the MA plans such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments are, on average, equal to traditional
Medicare. In addition, the Health Reform Law implements fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. As a result of these changes, payments to MA plans are estimated to be reduced by $138 to $145 billion between 2010
and 2019. These reductions to MA plan premium payments paid by the federal government may cause some plans to raise beneficiary premiums or limit benefits, which in turn might cause some Medicare beneficiaries to terminate their MA coverage and
enroll in traditional Medicare.

Physician-Owned Hospital Limitations

Over the last decade, we have faced competition from hospitals that have physician ownership. The Health Reform Law
prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and
Medicaid after December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.



Program Integrity and Fraud and Abuse

The Health Reform Law makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional
enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law:
(1) provides $350 million in increased federal funding over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse; (2) expands the scope of the RAC program to include MA plans and Medicaid; (3) authorizes HHS, in consultation
with the OIG, to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services or a supplier “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud;” (4) provides Medicare contractors with additional flexibility to conduct
random prepayment reviews; and (5) tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments.

Impact of Health Reform Law on the Company

The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in an increase in the number of patients
using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, the Health Reform Law provides for initiatives that create possible sources of additional revenue, such as ACOs. However, any positive effects of the Health Reform
Law could be offset, and the Company could be significantly impacted, by reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the net effect of the Health Reform Law on the Company because the resolution of a
number of material factors remains unclear, including the following:

•

how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms;

•

the potential for and impact of further delays in or complications related to implementation of the Health Reform Law (for example, there were
significant problems during the initial implementation of the Exchanges that negatively impacted the ability of individuals to enroll in Medicaid and to purchase health insurance);

•

the possibility of enactment of additional federal or state health care reforms and possible changes to the Health Reform Law;

•

our ability to participate in health insurance plans offered through the Exchanges and the terms of our participation as well as treatment of out of
network claims;

•

how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law (based on the CBO’s February 2014
estimates, by 2022, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 25 million additional individuals);

•

what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health
insurers;

•

the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;

•

the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;

•

the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;

•

the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals and individuals with existing coverage, including those covered through
the Exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid program;

•

the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;

•

the effect of the value-based purchasing provisions of the Health Reform Law on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality
programs;



•

the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have
traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;

•

the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented (42% of our
revenues in 2013 were from Medicare and Medicaid);

•

the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;

•

the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions and the allocation of the Medicaid DSH reductions to our hospitals;

•

how successful ACOs will be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement;

•

the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care
programs;

•

whether the Company’s revenues from Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a federally approved waiver program (“Waiver
Program”), will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs; and

•

the impact of efforts to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and remaining or new federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.

General Economic and Demographic Factors

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state and local
government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. The federal deficit, the growing
magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential
declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures, increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of
health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in our collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts. The Health Reform Law seeks to decrease over time the number of uninsured
individuals, but it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law.

Compliance Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics
and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health
Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify
our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other



practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.
Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination
in the future that could adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we
are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
$50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with
unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

We
purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The directors and officers liability coverage includes a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition,
we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per claim up to 5% of
the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 215,000 employees, including approximately
53,000 part-time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to
employment. At December 31, 2013, certain employees at 38 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2014, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider
our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse
and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and
productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and
physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their
affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and
benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs



could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and
the National Labor Relations Board’s (the “NLRB”) modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs
could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect
labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations.

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit
our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.

We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2013, our total indebtedness was $28.376 billion. As of
December 31, 2013, we had availability of $1.942 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $60 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base
limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government
regulations;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore
reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product or service line development, debt service
requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less
highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness
in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
intensify.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not
be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.



In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries.
Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not
be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash
from our subsidiaries. We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness with longer-maturity debt at a higher interest rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected
by the current global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of
our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital
expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available
cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to
consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit
our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our
asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into
any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to cash collateralize letters of credit issued
thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified
financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both
the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the
senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate



all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to
secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured
credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.

Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for
patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the local communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website performance data related
to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality
measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Further, the Health Reform Law requires every hospital to establish and update annually a public listing of the
hospital’s standard charges for items and services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher
than our competitors, our patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty
hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive
environment. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance
capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in
ACOs or other clinical integration models. Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel.
If ambulatory surgery centers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ambulatory surgery
centers. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at
their facilities than our hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”

The growth of uninsured and patient due accounts and a deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could
adversely affect our results of operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable
relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain
outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Although Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion of Medicare bad debts, the Jobs Creation Act reduced the reimbursement level from 70% of
eligible bad debts to 65% beginning in federal fiscal year 2013.

The amount of the provision for doubtful
accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state



governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2013, our allowance for doubtful
accounts represented approximately 93% of the $5.927 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from $11.214 billion for 2011 to
$13.841 billion for 2012 and to $15.565 billion for 2013.

Any increase in the amount or
deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care as a result of a number of
factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and continued high unemployment. The Health Reform Law seeks to decrease, over time, the number of uninsured individuals through reforms, most of which became effective January 1,
2014, but it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law. For example, a number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. These states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date, and it is unclear how many
states will ultimately decline to implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law. Further, the President has delayed until January 1, 2015, implementation of the employer mandate, which requires firms with 50 or more full-time employees
to offer health insurance or pay fines. For employers with 50 to 99 employees, this mandate has been further delayed until January 1, 2016. Even after full implementation of the Health Reform Law, we may continue to experience bad debts and have to
provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for
certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, implementation of the Health Reform Law could result in some patients terminating their current insurance plans in favor of lower cost Medicaid plans or other insurance coverage with lower
reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures, including health savings accounts, narrow networks and tiered networks, which shift
greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.

Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and
Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 42% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2013. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of
operations.

In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some
cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “BCA”) provides for new spending on program integrity initiatives intended to reduce
fraud and abuse under the Medicare program. The BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage
reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The BCA spending reductions began on March 1, 2013, with CMS imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims
beginning on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended by Congress through 2024. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress or whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure
the automatic budget cuts. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates
and Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For
example, CMS has established what is referred to as the “two midnight rule,” which provides that Medicare beneficiaries are only to be admitted as inpatients when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically
necessary and will be required across two midnights



absent unusual circumstances. Compliance with the rule became required for admissions beginning October 1, 2013 and will become subject to RAC audits beginning October 1, 2014.

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a
state’s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll
Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. The economic downturn increased the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary
pressures have resulted, and likely may continue to result, in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental
payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. CMS approved a five-year Medicaid waiver in December 2011 that
allows Texas to continue receiving supplemental Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its Medicaid managed care program. However, we cannot predict whether the Texas private supplemental Medicaid Waiver Program will continue or guarantee that
revenues recognized from the program will not decrease.

The Health Reform Law made changes to the Medicaid
program and will likely cause additional changes in the future. For example, the Health Reform Law provides for material reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. The Health Reform Law will result in increased state legislative and regulatory changes in
order for states to comply with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish or participate in Exchanges and to participate in grants and other incentive opportunities. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion
provisions of the Health Reform Law, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. It is unclear how many states will ultimately decline to implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law.

In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment
rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.

Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care
programs and changes to commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We are unable to predict the impact of the Health Reform Law, which represents a significant change to the health care
industry.

The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed
through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the establishment and expansion of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. In
addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement and establishes ACOs and bundled payment pilot programs. The expansion of health insurance coverage under the
Health Reform Law may result in an increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage, and our facilities may benefit from Health Reform Law initiatives that create possible sources of
additional revenue. However, any positive effects of the Health Reform Law could be offset and the Company could be significantly impacted by reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the net effect
of the Health Reform Law on the Company because the resolution of a number of material factors remains unclear, including the following:

•

how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms;

•

the potential for and impact of further delays in or complications related to implementation of the Health Reform Law (for example, there were
significant problems during the initial implementation of



the Exchanges that negatively impacted the ability of individuals to enroll in Medicaid and to purchase health insurance);

•

the possibility of enactment of additional federal or state health care reforms and possible changes to the Health Reform Law;

•

our ability to participate in health insurance plans offered through the Exchanges and the terms of our participation as well as treatment of out of
network claims;

•

how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law (based on the CBO’s February 2014
estimates, by 2022, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 25 million additional individuals);

•

what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health
insurers;

•

the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;

•

the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;

•

the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;

•

the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals and individuals with existing coverage including those covered through
the Exchanges, and those who might be covered under the Medicaid program;

•

the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;

•

the effect of the value-based purchasing provisions of the Health Reform Law on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality
programs;

•

the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have
traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;

•

the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented (42% of our
revenues in 2013 were from Medicare and Medicaid);

•

the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;

•

the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions and the allocation of the Medicaid DSH reductions to our hospitals;

•

how successful ACOs will be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement;

•

the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care
programs;

•

whether the Company’s revenues from Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a federally approved waiver program (“Waiver
Program”), will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs; and

•

the impact of efforts to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and remaining or new federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.

If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment payers,
including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.

Our ability to obtain favorable contracts with
nongovernment payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities. Revenues derived



from these entities and other insurers (domestic only) accounted for 54.6%, 54.5% and 52.9% of our revenues for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Nongovernment payers, including managed care
payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. As various provisions of the Health Reform Law are implemented,
including the Exchanges, nongovernment payers increasingly may demand reduced fees and utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose significantly higher cost sharing
obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For
example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and
renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other payers imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on
our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in plan networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts
received from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our performance depends on our ability to
recruit and retain quality physicians.

The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and
quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although
we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians
may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may
be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.

Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We
compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some
markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical
support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate.
Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the NLRB’s modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is
possible our labor costs could increase materially. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation
process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place.
State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise
rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management,
nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.



If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we
could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

The health care
industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;

•

classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;

•

necessity and adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical
records;

•

screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and certification;

•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

preparing and filing of cost reports;

•

operating policies and procedures;

•

activities regarding competitors; and

•

addition of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the federal FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either
refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that
outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with
physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute
but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be
brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law
by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies
fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be
found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”



We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have
operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In
addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law, the FCA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including civil penalties (including the loss of
our licenses to operate one or more facilities), exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws and regulations, criminal
penalties.

We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these
laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes
in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these
laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level
may be adopted that adversely affect our business.

We have been and could become the subject of
governmental investigations, claims and litigation.

Health care companies are subject to numerous
investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain
overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject
to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare
Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal
audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position,
results of operations and liquidity.

CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency fee basis to conduct
post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. In February 2012, CMS initiated a RAC prepayment demonstration program in 11 states. The Health Reform Law expands the RAC program’s scope to
include managed Medicare plans and Medicaid claims. RAC denials are appealable; however, HHS has imposed a suspension of assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges for at least two years beginning July 16, 2013. This
suspension will delay our ability to appeal RAC payment denials during this period. In addition, CMS employs MICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the
MIC program. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities.

Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be
negatively impacted.



Physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies or
governmental or managed care controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in
some instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by health plans. Inpatient
utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery
services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. For example, the Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions
on their use. Although we are unable to predict the effect these changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material, adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical
volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.

Our overall
business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.

Budget deficits at federal,
state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer
sources for our hospitals. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and
nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in our collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables.

The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based
purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report
certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”). The Health Reform Law also prohibits the use of
federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will
receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments.

Hospitals with excess
readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS will receive a reduction in operating payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in
payments to hospitals with excess readmissions is capped at 2% for federal fiscal year 2014 and 3% for federal fiscal year 2015 and thereafter.

As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 1.25% in federal
fiscal year 2014. This percentage will increase by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years. HHS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed
certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that it will distribute $1.1 billion to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2014 based on their achievement (relative to other



hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under
the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.

Many large commercial payers currently
require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees
or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.

We expect value-based purchasing programs,
including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict our future reductions and payments under these
programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues.

Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or availability of our systems could adversely affect
operations or delay the collection of revenues. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures through technology, processes, and our people; utilize current security technologies; and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested
internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced new attacks against information technology systems create risk of cyber security incidents that could impact
availability of systems. The occurrence of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems or liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

The performance of our information technology and systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our
shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management;

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and

•

monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.

If we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems and transition to the ICD-10 coding
system, our operations could be adversely affected.

As required by ARRA, the Secretary of HHS has
developed and implemented an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology. HHS uses the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (“PECOS”) to
verify Medicare enrollment prior to making EHR incentive program payments. During 2013, we received Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for being a meaningful user of certified EHR technology and recorded incentive income of $216 million for
the year.

We have incurred and will continue to incur both capital costs and operating expenses in order to
implement our certified EHR technology and meet meaningful use requirements. These expenses are ongoing and are projected to continue over all stages of implementation of meaningful use. The timing of expenses will not



correlate with the receipt of the incentive payments and the recognition of incentive income. During 2013, we incurred $113 million of operating expenses to implement our certified EHR
technology and to meet meaningful use. If our eligible hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be
eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing certified EHR technology. Further, eligible providers that have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior
reporting period will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare, beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 for eligible hospitals and calendar year 2015 for eligible professionals. Failure to implement and continue to demonstrate meaningful use of
certified EHR technology could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Health plans and providers, including our hospitals, are required to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system, which greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for inpatient claims. Use
of the ICD-10 system is required beginning October 1, 2014. Transition to the new ICD-10 system requires significant investment in training of staff and physicians involved in the coding and billing process as well as investment in coding
technology and software. In addition to these upfront costs of transition to ICD-10, it is possible that our hospitals could experience disruption or delays in payment due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving our
systems or the systems and implementation efforts of health plans and their business partners. Further, the transition to the more detailed ICD-10 coding system could result in decreased reimbursement if the use of ICD-10 codes results in conditions
being reclassified to MS-DRGs or commercial payer payment groupings with lower levels of reimbursement than assigned under the previous system.

State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval,
often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or
expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The
failure to obtain any requested CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our
revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may encounter difficulty
acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.

A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may
encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or
other facility or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states
have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community
involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These
conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements
and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may



negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well
as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing
operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health
care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek
indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of
acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.

Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.

We operated 165 hospitals at December 31, 2013, and 78 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our
Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented approximately 46% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and
competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business
results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other areas across the Gulf Coast are located in
hurricane-prone areas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a
particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims by the Internal Revenue Service.

We expect the IRS Examination Division will begin an audit of HCA Holdings, Inc.’s 2011 federal income tax return in
2014.

Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported
taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if
payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and
others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional
liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our 100% owned liability
insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts are included in its reserves for professional liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the
reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance



contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and
financial position could be adversely affected.

We are exposed to market risks related to changes in the
market values of securities and interest rate changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes
in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $506 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013. These investments are carried at fair value,
with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2013, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our
100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize
other-than-temporary impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into
interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and
maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.

The Investors continue to have influence over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the future.

Through their investment in Hercules Holdings II, LLC, the Investors continue to hold a significant
interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 29% as of January 31, 2014). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holdings II, LLC, representatives of the Investors have the continued right to
designate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, the Investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and to potentially prevent changes in the
composition of our Board of Directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval.

Additionally,
the Investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or more of the Investors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be
complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number of hospitals (general, acute care, psychiatric and rehabilitation)
directly or indirectly owned and operated by us as of December 31, 2013:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we directly or indirectly operate
115 freestanding surgery centers. We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Fourteen of our general, acute care
hospitals and three of our other properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under our senior secured cash flow credit facility and first lien secured notes.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately 1,400,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee area. In
addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain regional service centers related to our shared services initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in general,
adequate for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating their operation. Management does not believe that compliance with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect
our financial position or results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position
in a given period.



Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal
False Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some
states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by,
federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

As initially disclosed in 2010, the DOJ has contacted the Company in connection
with its nationwide review of whether, in certain cases, hospital charges to the federal government relating to implantable cardio-defibrillators (“ICDs”) met the CMS criteria. In connection with this nationwide review, the DOJ has
indicated that it will be reviewing certain ICD billing and medical records at 95 HCA hospitals; the review covers the period from October 2003 to the present. In August 2012, HCA, along with non-HCA hospitals across the country subject to the
DOJ’s review, received from the DOJ a proposed framework for resolving the DOJ’s review of ICDs. The Company is cooperating in the review. The review could potentially give rise to claims against the Company under the federal FCA or other
statutes, regulations or laws. At this time, we cannot predict what effect, if any, this review or any resulting claims could have on the Company.

In July 2012, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami requested information on reviews assessing the medical necessity of interventional cardiology services provided at any Company
facility (other than peer reviews). The Company is cooperating with the government’s request and has produced medical records associated with particular reviews at eight hospitals, located primarily in Florida. At this time, we cannot
predict what effect, if any, the request or any resulting claims, including any potential claims under the federal FCA, other statutes, regulations or laws, could have on the Company.

Securities Class Action Litigation

On October 28, 2011, a shareholder action, Schuh v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al., was filed in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee seeking monetary relief. The case sought to include as a class all persons who acquired the Company’s stock pursuant or traceable to the Company’s Registration Statement issued in
connection with the March 9, 2011 initial public offering. The lawsuit asserted a claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the Company, certain members of the board of directors, and certain underwriters in the
offering. It further asserted a claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the same members of the board of directors. The action alleged various deficiencies in the Company’s disclosures in the Registration Statement.
Subsequently, two additional class action complaints, Kishtah v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al. and Daniels v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al., setting forth substantially similar claims against substantially the same defendants were filed in the same
federal court on November 16, 2011 and December 12, 2011, respectively. All three of the cases were consolidated. On May 3, 2012, the court appointed New England Teamsters & Trucking Industry Pension Fund as Lead Plaintiff
for the consolidated action. On July 13, 2012, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 against the Company, certain members of the board of directors, and
certain underwriters in the offering. It further asserts a claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the same members of the board of directors and Hercules Holdings II, LLC, a majority shareholder of the Company at the time
of the initial public offering. The consolidated complaint alleges deficiencies in the Company’s disclosures in the Registration Statement and Prospectus relating to: (1) the accounting for the Company’s 2006 recapitalization and 2010
reorganization; (2) the Company’s failure to maintain effective internal controls relating to its accounting for such transactions; and (3) the Company’s Medicare and Medicaid revenue growth rates. The Company and other
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on September 11, 2012. The Court granted the motion in part on May 28, 2013. The action is proceeding to discovery on the remaining claims.



In addition to the above described shareholder class actions, on
December 8, 2011, a federal shareholder derivative action, Sutton v. Bracken, et al., putatively initiated in the name of the Company, was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against certain officers
and present and former directors of the Company seeking monetary relief. The action alleges breaches of fiduciary duties by the named officers and directors in connection with the accounting and earnings claims set forth in the shareholder class
actions. Setting forth substantially similar claims against substantially the same defendants, an additional federal derivative action, Schroeder v. Bracken, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee
on December 16, 2011, and a state derivative action, Bagot v. Bracken, et al., was filed in Tennessee state court in the Davidson County Circuit Court on December 20, 2011. The federal derivative actions were consolidated in the Middle
District of Tennessee and stayed pending developments in the shareholder class actions. The state derivative action had also been stayed pending developments in the shareholder class actions, but that stay has expired. The plaintiff in the state
derivative action subsequently filed an amended complaint on September 9, 2013 that added additional allegations made in the shareholder class actions. On September 24, 2013, an additional state derivative action, Steinberg v. Bracken, et
al., was filed in Tennessee state court in the Davidson County Circuit Court. This action against our board of directors has been consolidated with the earlier filed state derivative action. The plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a
consolidated complaint on December 4, 2013. The Company has filed a motion to again stay the state derivative action pending developments in the class action, but the Court has not yet acted on that motion.

Health Midwest Litigation

In October 2009, the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against HCA Inc. in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri and alleged that HCA did not
fund the level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA’s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central issue in the case was whether HCA’s construction of new hospitals counted
towards its $450 million five-year capital commitments. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. On January 24, 2013, the Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and
awarded at least $162 million. The Court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA’s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care during the ten years following the purchase. Should the
accounting fail to satisfy the Court concerning HCA’s compliance with its capital and charity care commitments, the amount of the judgment award could substantially increase. The Court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees,
which the parties have stipulated are about $12 million. HCA recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling. The accounting for HCA’s capital expenditures and charity and uncompensated care is
ongoing and will likely not be concluded before the fourth quarter of 2014. HCA plans to appeal the trial court’s ruling on the breach of contract claim and order for the accounting once the trial court rules on the accounting and enters final
judgment.

General Liability and Other Claims

We are subject to claims for additional income taxes and related interest.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal
injuries or for wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of
management, the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Financing Activities” for a description of the restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.

During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87,719,300 shares of our common stock. Our first day of
trading was March 10, 2011. During September 2011, we repurchased 80,771,143 shares of our common stock, beneficially owned by affiliates of Bank of America Corporation, at a purchase price of $18.61 per share. The shares repurchased
represented approximately 15.6% of our total shares outstanding at the time of the repurchase. During November 2013, we repurchased 10,656,436 shares of our common stock at a price of $46.92 per share. Our common stock is traded on the New York
Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) (symbol “HCA”).

During 2012, our Board of Directors declared
three distributions to the Company’s stockholders and holders of certain vested share-based awards. The distributions totaled $6.50 per share and vested share-based award (subject to limitations for certain awards), or $3.142 billion in
the aggregate. Pursuant to the terms of our share-based award plans, the holders of nonvested stock options and SARs received $6.50 per share reductions to the exercise price of the applicable share-based awards (subject to certain limitations for
certain share-based awards that resulted in deferred distributions for a portion of the declared distribution, which will be paid upon the vesting of the applicable share-based award). The holders of nonvested RSUs will be paid the applicable
distribution amounts upon the vesting of the applicable RSUs. There were no distributions declared during 2013.

The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated, the high and low sales prices per share reported on the
NYSE for our common stock.

At the close of business on January 31, 2014, there were approximately 270 holders
of record of our common stock.

Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals.

(h)

Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day.

(i)

Represents the percentage of hospital licensed beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and occupancy rate provide measures of the
utilization of inpatient rooms.

(j)

Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms.

(k)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in outpatient surgeries.

(l)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in inpatient surgeries.

2013 Operations Summary

Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $1.556 billion, or $3.37 per diluted share, for 2013, compared
to $1.605 billion, or $3.49 per diluted share, for 2012. The 2013 results include net losses on sales of facilities of $10 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share, and a loss on retirement of debt of $17 million (pretax), or $0.02 per
diluted share. The 2012 results include legal claim costs of $175 million (pretax), or $0.24 per diluted share, and net gains on sales of facilities of $15 million (pretax), or $0.02 per diluted share. All “per diluted share”
disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 461.913 million shares and 459.403 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Revenues increased to $34.182 billion for 2013 from $33.013 billion for 2012. Revenues increased
3.5% and 3.1%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2013, compared to 2012. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent
admission and a 0.4% increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted primarily from a 3.0% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.1% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

During 2013, consolidated admissions increased 0.2% and same facility admissions increased 0.1%, compared to
2012. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 0.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.3% on a same facility basis during 2013, compared to 2012. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.9% on a consolidated basis and declined 0.5% on a same
facility basis during 2013, compared to 2012. Emergency room visits increased 0.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.7% on a same facility basis during 2013, compared to 2012.

For 2013, the provision for doubtful accounts increased $88 million, compared to 2012. The self-pay revenue
deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $404 million and $1.232 billion, respectively, for 2013, compared to 2012. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum
of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 31.3% for 2013, compared to 29.5% for 2012. Same facility uninsured admissions increased 7.6% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased
2.2% for 2013, compared to 2012.

Interest expense totaled $1.848 billion for 2013, compared to
$1.798 billion for 2012. The $50 million increase in interest expense for 2013 was due primarily to an increase in the average debt balance.

Cash flows from operating activities declined $495 million, from $4.175 billion for 2012 to $3.680 billion for 2013. The decline in cash flows from operating activities was primarily
related to net negative changes in working capital items of $521 million.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our
business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:

Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets.

We believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing
markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community and adding
attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points, including surgery
centers, rural outreach, freestanding emergency departments and walk-in clinics.

Achieve Industry-Leading
Performance in Clinical and Satisfaction Measures.

Achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business model. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of
initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways
to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an
environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.

Recruit
and Employ Physicians to Meet Need for High Quality Health Services.

We depend on the quality and dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth
strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced
technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.

Continue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to Enhance Profitability.

We believe there is significant
opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our franchise. We are currently pursuing next generation performance improvement initiatives such as contracting for services on a multistate
basis and expanding our support infrastructure for additional clinical and support functions, such as physician credentialing, medical transcription and electronic medical recordkeeping. We believe our centrally managed business processes and
ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our Parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including
revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions and are offering these services to other hospital companies.

Selectively Pursue a Disciplined Development Strategy.

We continue to believe there are significant growth
opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our in-market opportunities. To complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring
new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. We believe the challenges faced by the hospital industry may spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us
well to participate in any such consolidation. We have a

strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make
changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are
based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a
payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to
consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have invested significant resources to refine and improve our computerized
billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related training programs to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare
program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment.
Federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care
services they receive. The Health Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. Further,
the Health Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements or incentives, which become effective during 2014, for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance
coverage. These mandates may reduce the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, many factors are unknown regarding the impact of the Health Reform Law, including how many previously uninsured
individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the law, the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals and overall changes in the payer mix.

Revenues (continued)

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our
guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The federal
poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to those
provided to many local managed care plans. After the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients’ accounts, and we record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon our
historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.

Due
to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject to interpretations that could result in payments
that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective
year were $41 million, $50 million and $40 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during
previous years were $68 million, $242 million and $30 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2012 amount related to cost reports filed during previous years includes two adjustments to Medicare revenues that affected
multiple annual cost report periods for the majority of our hospitals (the Rural Floor Provision Settlement which increased revenues by approximately $271 million and the implementation of revised Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”)
ratios which reduced revenues by approximately $75 million). Excluding the effect of these Medicare adjustments, the 2012 amount related to previous years would have been $46 million. We expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to
Medicare and Medicaid cost report filings and settlements and disproportionate-share funds will result in increases to revenues within generally similar ranges.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable
agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance
for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a
review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external
collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). Writeoffs are based
upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly
changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations. At both December 31, 2013 and 2012, the
allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 93%, of the $5.927 billion and $5.228 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured
portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance.

To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the revenue
deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in
millions):

The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as
a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from 27.4% for 2011, to 29.5% for 2012 and to 31.3% for 2013.

Days revenues in accounts receivable were 54 days, 51 days and 52 days at December 31, 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage, general economic conditions,
patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payer classification
as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 is set forth in the following table:

Professional Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our
facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention. We purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in
excess of $50 million per occurrence. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $314 million, $331 million and $244 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and
unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of
our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves
are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and
retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including:
paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims)
and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and
other information. Company-specific claim reporting and settlement data collected over an approximate 20-year period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including
historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.

Professional Liability Claims (continued)

Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon
actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.137 billion to $1.359 billion at December 31, 2013 and $1.130 billion to $1.346 billion at
December 31, 2012. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and
monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the
number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2% change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by
$18 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $17 million. A 2% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $73 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $67
million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate
liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,600 individual claims and 2,700 individual claims at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and estimates for unreported
potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time period between the occurrence and payment of final settlement for our
professional liability claims is approximately five years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an occurrence-to-settlement timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments
beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.279 billion and
$1.297 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $331 million and $324 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.”
Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for
professional liability risks (net of $24 million and $49 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively) were $1.255 billion and $1.248 billion at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2013 and 2012 are comprised of $710 million and $789 million, respectively, of case reserves for known
claims and $545 million and $459 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

Changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance

Income Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our
income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.

Although we believe we have
properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the
impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related
to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results
may vary from our estimates.

Results of Operations

Revenue/Volume Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and
negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health
plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our
guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care that are similar to the discounts provided to many local managed care
plans.

Trends (continued)

Revenues increased 3.5% to $34.182 billion for 2013 from
$33.013 billion for 2012 and increased 11.2% for 2012 from $29.682 billion for 2011. The increase in revenues in 2013 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.4%
increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2012 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.0% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 9.1% increase in equivalent admissions
compared to 2011. The increase in revenues (and volume metrics) for 2012 compared to 2011 related primarily to the impact of the financial consolidation of the HCA-HealthONE LLC venture for periods subsequent to our acquisition of controlling
interests during October 2011 (HealthONE revenues and related volume metrics are not included in our same facility amounts). HealthONE revenues included in our consolidated revenues increased from $347 million for 2011 to $2.203 billion in 2012.

Same facility revenues increased 3.1% for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2012 and increased 4.5% for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The 3.1% increase for 2013 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 3.0% increase in same facility
revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.1% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 4.5% increase for 2012 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 0.3% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a
4.1% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

Consolidated admissions increased 0.2% in 2013 compared
to 2012 and increased 7.4% in 2012 compared to 2011. Consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 0.5% and consolidated outpatient surgeries increased 0.9% during 2013 compared to 2012. Consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 4.5% and consolidated
outpatient surgeries increased 9.3% during 2012 compared to 2011. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 0.8% during 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 12.5% during 2012 compared to 2011.

Same facility admissions increased 0.1% in 2013 compared to 2012 and increased 3.0% in 2012 compared to 2011. Same

The approximate percentages of our inpatient revenues, before provision for doubtful
accounts, related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care plans and other insurers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are set forth below.

At December 31, 2013, we owned and operated 42 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in
the state of Florida. Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $7.545 billion, $7.336 billion and $6.989 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2013, we owned and
operated 36 hospitals and 24 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $8.192 billion, $8.012 billion and $7.829 billion for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
During 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 55%, 55% and 57% of our admissions and 46%, 47% and 50% of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 62%, 61% and 63% of our
uninsured admissions during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our
revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) approved a
Medicaid waiver that allows Texas to continue receiving supplemental Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its Medicaid managed care program. Thus, Texas is operating pursuant to a Waiver Program. The Texas Waiver Program includes two primary
components: the continuation of an indigent care component and the establishment of a Delivery System Reform Incentive

Trends (continued)

Payment (“DSRIP”) component. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system
reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. We provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation with other hospitals.
The state of Texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. As a result of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in Texas have available
funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some
portion of these available funds to the state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal Medicaid
funds. The state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. Our Texas
Medicaid revenues included $393 million ($76 million DSRIP related and $317 million indigent care related), $387 million (all indigent care related) and $540 million (all indigent care related) during 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, of Medicaid supplemental payments. In addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made
waiver requests to the CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs
being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

Electronic Health Record Incentive Payments

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments, beginning in
2011, for eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model
that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the
incentive payment is available.

During 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, we recognized $216 million, $336
million and $210 million of electronic health record incentive income related to Medicare ($183 million, $252 million and $123 million) and Medicaid ($33 million, $84 million and $87 million) incentive programs. At December 31, 2013, we
have $78 million of deferred EHR incentive income, which represents initial incentive payments received for which EHR incentive income has not been recognized.

We have incurred and will continue to incur both capital costs and operating expenses in order to implement our certified EHR technology and meet meaningful use requirements. These expenses are ongoing
and are projected to continue over all stages of implementation of meaningful use. The timing of recognizing the expenses may not correlate with the receipt of the incentive payments and the recognition of incentive income. During 2013, 2012 and
2011, respectively, we incurred $113 million, $80 million and $77 million of operating expenses to implement our certified EHR technology and meet meaningful use.

Electronic
Health Record Incentive Payments (continued)

For 2014, we estimate EHR incentive income will be recognized in the
range of $110 million to $130 million and that related EHR operating expenses will be in the range of $110 million to $130 million. Actual incentive payments and EHR operating expenses could vary from these estimates due to certain factors such as
availability of federal funding for both Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments and our ability to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. The failure of our ability to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR
technology could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.

(a)

Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient
volume.

(b)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent
admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation
“equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

(c)

Same facility information excludes the operations of hospitals and their related facilities that were either acquired, divested or removed from
service during the current and prior year.

consolidated admissions increased 0.2% and same facility admissions increased 0.1% for 2013 compared to 2012. Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes increased 0.5%, and same facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.3% during 2013 compared to 2012.
Consolidated outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.9%, and same facility outpatient surgeries declined 0.5% during 2013 compared to 2012. Emergency room visits increased 0.8% on a consolidated basis and increased 0.7% on a same facility basis
during 2013 compared to 2012.

Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 3.4% to $38.040
billion for 2013 from $36.783 billion for 2012. Provision for doubtful accounts increased $88 million from $3.770 billion in 2012 to $3.858 billion in 2013. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $404 million and
$1.232 billion, respectively, during 2013 compared to 2012. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and
charity care, was 31.3% for 2013 compared to 29.5% for 2012. At December 31, 2013, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 93% of the $5.927 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts,
net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased 3.5% to $34.182 billion for 2013 from $33.013 billion for 2012. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent
admission and a 0.4% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2012. Same facility revenues increased 3.1% due primarily to the combined impact of a 3.0% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.1% increase in same
facility equivalent admissions compared to 2012.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were
45.8% in 2013 and 45.7% in 2012. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 3.2% in 2013 compared to 2012. Same facility labor rate increases averaged 1.8% for 2013 compared to 2012. Share-based compensation expense increased from $56
million in 2012 to $113 million in 2013, and we expect the 2014 expense will increase by approximately $50 million to $60 million.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 17.5% in 2013 and 17.3% in 2012. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.0% in 2013 compared to 2012. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined to 18.2%
in 2013 from 18.3% in 2012. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes.
Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $314 million and $331 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively.

During 2013 and 2012, respectively, we recognized $216 million and $336 million of electronic health record incentive income related to Medicare ($183 million and $252 million) and Medicaid ($33
million and $84 million) incentive programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR
technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Equity in earnings of affiliates declined from $36 million for 2012 to $29 million for 2013.

Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was 5.1% in 2013 and 2012. Depreciation expense was
$1.733 billion for 2013 and $1.673 billion for 2012.

Interest expense increased to $1.848 billion
for 2013 from $1.798 billion for 2012. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the average debt balance. Our average debt balance was $28.377 billion for 2013 compared to $27.397 billion for 2012. The average
interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 6.6% for 2012 to 6.5% for 2013.

Net losses on sales of
facilities were $10 million for 2013 and related to the sale of a hospital facility and other real estate investments. Net gains on sales of facilities were $15 million for 2012 and related to the sales of health care entity investments.

During 2013, we redeemed all $201 million aggregate principal amount of our 9

% senior secured second lien notes due 2017, at a redemption price of 104.938% of the principal amount. The pretax loss on retirement of debt related to this redemption was $17 million.

During January 2013, a Missouri judge ruled in favor of a nonprofit health foundation in a lawsuit against HCA. In the
case, the plaintiff alleged HCA did not make the full level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with its purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. We recorded $175 million of legal claim costs during the
fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling.

The effective tax rate was 37.9% and 35.6% for 2013 and 2012,
respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provision for income taxes for 2012 was reduced by $33 million related to a reduction in
interest expense related to taxing authority examinations. Excluding the effect of this adjustment, the effective tax rate for 2012 would have been 36.9%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $401 million for 2012 to $440 million for 2013. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related
primarily to growth in operating results of a hospital joint venture in one of our Texas markets.

years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87.719 million shares of our common stock, and during September 2011, we repurchased 80.771 million shares of our
common stock.

During 2012, consolidated admissions increased 7.4% and same facility admissions increased 3.0%

patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues
increased 11.2% to $33.013 billion for 2012 from $29.682 billion for 2011. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.0% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 9.1% increase in equivalent
admissions compared to 2011. Same facility revenues increased 4.5% due primarily to the combined impact of a 0.3% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.1% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2011.
The increase in revenues (and volume metrics) for 2012 compared to 2011 related primarily to the impact of the financial consolidation of the HCA-HealthONE LLC venture for periods subsequent to our acquisition of controlling interests during October
2011 (HealthONE revenues and volume metrics are not included in our same facility amounts). HealthONE revenues included in our consolidated revenues increased from $347 million in 2011 to $2.203 billion in 2012. Two adjustments (Rural Floor
Provision Settlement and SSI ratios) related to Medicare revenues for prior period cost reports and the current period resulted in a net increase of $188 million to 2012 revenues.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.7% in 2012 and 45.3% in 2011. Salaries and benefits per
equivalent admission increased 2.9% in 2012 compared to 2011. Same facility labor rate increases

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined to 18.3% in 2012 from 18.5% in 2011. Other operating
expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Other operating expenses include
$234 million and $317 million of indigent care costs in certain Texas markets during 2012 and 2011, respectively. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $331 million and $244 million for 2012 and 2011,
respectively.

During 2012 and 2011, respectively, we recognized $336 million and $210 million of
electronic health record incentive income related to Medicare ($252 million and $123 million) and Medicaid ($84 million and $87 million) incentive programs. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain
contingency model that is based upon when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final
calculation of the incentive payment is available.

Equity in earnings of affiliates declined from
$258 million for 2011 to $36 million for 2012. Equity in earnings of affiliates during 2011 related primarily to our Denver, Colorado market joint venture, which effective November 1, 2011, we began consolidating due to our
acquisition of the approximate 40% remaining ownership interest.

Depreciation and amortization increased, as
a percentage of revenues, to 5.1% in 2012 from 4.9% in 2011. The consolidation of HealthONE for periods subsequent to November 1, 2011 represents $113 million of the increase in depreciation and amortization. Depreciation expense was
$1.673 billion for 2012 and $1.461 billion for 2011.

Interest expense declined to
$1.798 billion for 2012 from $2.037 billion for 2011. The decline in interest expense was due to a decline in the average interest rate. Our average debt balance was $27.397 billion for 2012 compared to $26.588 billion for 2011.
The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 7.7% for 2011 to 6.6% for 2012.

During October 2011, we completed our acquisition of the Colorado Health
Foundation’s (“Foundation”) approximate 40% remaining ownership interest in the HealthONE joint venture for $1.450 billion. We recorded a gain on the acquisition of a controlling interest in an equity investment of $1.522 billion
related to the remeasurement of our previous equity investment in HealthONE based upon our acquisition of the Foundation’s ownership interest and the resulting consolidation of the entire enterprise at estimated fair value.

Our Investors provided management and advisory services to the Company, pursuant to a management agreement among HCA and
the Investors executed in connection with the Investors’ acquisition of HCA in November 2006. In March 2011, the management agreement was terminated pursuant to its terms upon completion of the initial public offering of our common stock, and
the Investors were paid a final fee of $181 million.

The effective tax rate was 35.6% and 22.6% for 2012
and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provision for income taxes for 2012 was reduced by $33 million related to a
reduction in interest expense related to taxing authority examinations. Our income before income taxes for 2011 included $1.255 billion of nontaxable gain related to the reported gain on the acquisition of a controlling interest in an equity
investment. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 would have been 36.9% and 37.3%, respectively.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $377 million for 2011 to $401 million for 2012. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related
primarily to growth in operating results of certain surgery center joint ventures.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing
properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from operating activities,
issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.

Cash
provided by operating activities totaled $3.680 billion in 2013 compared to $4.175 billion in 2012 and $3.933 billion in 2011. Working capital totaled $2.342 billion at December 31, 2013 and $1.591 billion at
December 31, 2012. The $495 million decline in cash provided by operating activities for 2013, compared to 2012, was primarily related to net negative changes in working capital items of $521 million. The $242 million increase in cash
provided by operating activities for 2012, compared to 2011, was primarily related to a positive

impact from changes in working capital items of $236 million, as cash benefits from income items were offset by increased tax payments. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $185
million for 2013 compared to 2012 and increased $610 million for 2012 compared to 2011.

Cash used in
investing activities was $2.346 billion, $2.063 billion and $2.995 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $1.943 billion in 2013, $1.862 billion in 2012 and
$1.679 billion in 2011. We expended $481 million, $258 million and $1.682 billion for acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions in 2013 included three hospitals,
expenditures for acquisitions in 2012 included one hospital and expenditures for acquisitions in 2011 included eight hospital facilities, seven of which were related to the acquisition of the remaining interests in HealthONE. Planned capital
expenditures are expected to approximate $2.2 billion in 2014. At December 31, 2013, there were projects under construction which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately
$1.8 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2013, we received cash of $33 million from sales of a hospital, real estate investments and other health care
entities. We also received net cash proceeds of $36 million related to net changes in our investments. During 2012, we received cash of $30 million from sales of real estate investments and other health care entities. We also received net cash
proceeds of $16 million related to net changes in our investments. During 2011, we received cash of $281 million from sales of one hospital, other health care entities and real estate investments. We also received net cash proceeds of $80 million
related to net changes in our investments.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.625 billion in 2013,
$1.780 billion in 2012 and $976 million in 2011. During 2013, we had a decline of $692 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $500 million for repurchases of common stock. During 2012, we had a net increase of $1.724 billion in our
indebtedness. During 2011, we received cash of $2.506 billion related to the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our initial public offering; we used cash of $1.503 billion for repurchases of common stock; and we used cash proceeds from
issuance of common stock and available cash provided by operations to make net debt repayments of $1.589 billion. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we paid $16 million, $3.148 billion and $31 million, respectively, in distributions to our
stockholders. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $435 million, $401 million and $378 million, respectively. We paid debt issuance costs of $5 million, $62 million and $92 million
for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we received income tax benefits of $113 million, $174 million and $63 million, respectively, for certain items (primarily the cash distributions to holders of our stock options
and exercises of stock options) that were deductible expenses for tax purposes, but were recognized as adjustments to stockholders’ deficit for financial reporting purposes. We or our affiliates, including affiliates of the Investors, may in
the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal
requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. Funds for the repurchase of debt or equity securities
have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

In addition
to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.002 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $1.972 billion as of January 31, 2014) and
anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.

During 2012, our Board of Directors declared three
distributions to our stockholders and holders of certain vested share-based awards. The distributions totaled $6.50 per share and vested share-based award, or $3.142 billion in the aggregate. The distributions were funded using funds available
under our existing senior secured credit facilities and proceeds from the December 2012 issuance of $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021. There were no distributions declared during 2013 or
2011.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay
claims, totaled $510 million and $570 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $315 million and $352 million at December 31,
2013 and 2012, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net
reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $940 million and $896 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are
expected to approximate $326 million. We estimate that approximately $264 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $28.376 billion and $28.930 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our interest
expense was $1.848 billion for 2013 and $1.798 billion for 2012.

During February 2012, we issued
$1.350 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior secured first lien notes due 2022. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

During October 2012, we issued $2.500 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of $1.250 billion of
4.75% senior secured first lien notes due 2023 and $1.250 billion of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which included the repayment of an
existing term loan due November 2013.

During December 2012, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal
amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the net proceeds to pay a distribution to our stockholders and holders of certain vested stock awards.

During March 2013, we redeemed all $201 million aggregate principal amount of our 9

% senior secured second lien notes due 2017, at a redemption price of 104.938% of the principal amount. The pretax loss on retirement of debt related to this redemption was $17 million.

During November 2013, our $329 million senior secured European term loan facility matured.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2013, maturities of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are presented in the
table below (dollars in millions):

(a)

We have not included obligations to pay net estimated professional liability claims ($1.255 billion at December 31, 2013, including net
reserves of $315 million relating to the 100% owned insurance subsidiary) in this table. The estimated professional liability claims, which occurred prior to 2007, are expected to be funded by the designated investment securities that are
restricted for this purpose ($510 million at December 31, 2013). We also have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $462 million at December 31, 2013, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or
amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b)

Estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at December 31, 2013, remain constant during the period
presented.

(c)

Amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance
sheet. Amounts also include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

(d)

Amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers who have provided surety bonds to cover
self-insured workers’ compensation claims, utility deposits and damages for malpractice cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts. These cases are currently under appeal and the bonds will not be released by the courts until the
cases are closed.

(e)

Amounts relate primarily to various insurance programs and employee benefit plan obligations for which we have letters of credit outstanding.

(f)

In consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the
benefit of the respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians’ practices. The actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the
financial results of the physicians’ private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. The physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at December 31, 2013.

(g)

We have entered into guarantee agreements related to certain leases.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $506 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as
adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2013, we had a net unrealized gain of $10 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short
notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with
creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these
derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income, and changes in the fair value of derivatives which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in operations.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $3.540 billion of long-term debt at
December 31, 2013 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $24.836 billion at December 31, 2013 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and,
for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit
facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or
(b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest
rate for our long-term debt declined from 6.6% for 2012 to 6.5% for 2013.

The estimated fair value of our
total long-term debt was $29.603 billion at December 31, 2013. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in
interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $35 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at
fixed rates.

Our international operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies are
currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and
are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as
a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
the hedged items when they occur. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting
from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare patients are
established under the federal government’s prospective payment system. Total fee-for-service Medicare revenues were 23.3%, 25.1% and 25.8% of our revenues for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure
because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to
maintain operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.

IRS Examinations

We expect the IRS Examination Division will begin an audit of HCA Holdings, Inc.’s 2011 federal income tax return in
2014.

Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable
income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments
due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Controls and Procedures

1. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective, can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, has issued a report on our internal
control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

(b) Attestation Report of the Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited HCA Holdings, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992
framework) (the “COSO criteria”). HCA Holdings, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Holdings, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of HCA Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of HCA Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2013. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HCA Holdings, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HCA Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework), and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Reporting Entity and Corporate Reorganization

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored
by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners and HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr. (collectively, the “Investors”) and by members of management and certain other investors. The
transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and liabilities.

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a new holding company structure (the “Corporate Reorganization”). HCA Holdings, Inc. became the parent company, and HCA Inc. became
HCA Holdings, Inc.’s 100% owned direct subsidiary. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of common stock were automatically converted, on a share for share basis, into identical shares of HCA Holdings,
Inc.’s common stock. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, HCA Holdings, Inc. was deemed the successor registrant to HCA Inc. under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87,719,300 shares of our common stock. Upon the
completion of a secondary offering in February 2013, we no longer qualify as a “controlled company” under the applicable New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing standards and were required to appoint a board of directors
comprised of a majority of independent members within one year of such date. Our common stock is traded on the NYSE (symbol “HCA”).

HCA Holdings, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA
Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2013, these affiliates owned and operated 165 hospitals, 115 freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and
ancillary services. HCA Holdings, Inc.’s facilities are located in 20 states and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or
indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization and to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the Corporate Reorganization. The term “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to
entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
“control” as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in which we have a
substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

We have completed various acquisitions and joint venture transactions. The accounts of these entities have been included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to our acquisition
of controlling interests. The majority of our expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be classified as general and

F-8


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Basis of
Presentation (continued)

administrative include our corporate office costs, which were $287 million, $248 million and $228 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates less allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded during the period the
health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial
insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed care agreements are
generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates. Revenues related to uninsured patients and copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts
applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to these uninsured accounts to record net self pay revenues at the estimated
amounts we expect to collect. Our revenues from third party payers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject
to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates will change by a material amount. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final
settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $41 million, $50 million and $40 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $68 million, $242 million and $30 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. The 2012 amount related to cost reports filed during previous years includes two adjustments to Medicare revenues that affected multiple

F-9


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Revenues (continued)

annual cost report periods for the majority of our hospitals (the Rural Floor Provision Settlement increased revenues by approximately $271 million and the implementation of revised Supplemental
Security Income ratios reduced revenues by approximately $75 million). Excluding the effect of these Medicare adjustments, the 2012 amount related to previous years would have been $46 million.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the Medicare
program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment.
Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. Because we do not pursue
collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to those provided to many
local managed care plans. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
uninsured discount is applied.

To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we
believe it is beneficial to view charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

A summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended
December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Revenues (continued)

The sum of charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for
doubtful accounts, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts increased from 27.4% for 2011, to 29.5% for 2012 and to 31.3% for 2013.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance subsidiaries’ cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts
required to pay estimated professional liability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash equivalents as these funds are not available for general corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Our cash management system provides
for daily investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling $461 million and $437 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, have
been included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. We
recognize that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not believe there are significant credit risks associated with these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other significant
concentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts and
subsequent recoveries are added. The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate to “uninsured” amounts due directly from patients (including copayment and deductible amounts from
patients who have health care coverage). Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. We consider the return of an account from the secondary collection agency to be the culmination of
our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management
relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information to utilize in
estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At both December 31, 2013 and 2012, the allowance for
doubtful accounts represented approximately 93% of the $5.927 billion and $5.228 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our
accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance. Days revenues in accounts

receivable were 54 days, 51 days and 52 days at December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, patient accounting service center
operations, payer mix or trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method, was $1.733 billion in 2013, $1.673 billion in
2012 and $1.461 billion in 2011. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from 10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to 10 years.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain long-lived assets expected to be
held and used, might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair
value less costs to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the investments of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were classified as “available-for-sale” as defined in Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) No. 320,

Investments — Debt and Equity Securities

and are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of providing a funding source to pay liability claims covered by the
insurance subsidiaries. We perform a quarterly assessment of individual investment securities to determine whether declines in market value are temporary or other-than-temporary. Our investment securities evaluation process involves multiple
subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a significant level of professional judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. We evaluate, among other things, the financial position and
near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to
determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and our ability and
intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair value, are important components of our investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets (continued)

Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our impairment testing is performed at the operating
division or market level. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit assets is less than their
carrying value, we compare the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value of goodwill is estimated based upon internal evaluations
of the related long-lived assets for each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar facilities. No goodwill impairments were recognized during 2013, 2012 and
2011. Since January 1, 2000, we have recognized total goodwill impairments of $102 million in the aggregate. None of the goodwill impairments related to evaluations of goodwill at the reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill
impairments during this period related to goodwill allocated to asset disposal groups.

During 2013, goodwill
increased by $265 million related to acquisitions, declined by $1 million related to facility sales and declined by $13 million related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments. During 2012, goodwill increased by $288 million related to
acquisitions, declined by $3 million related to facility sales and increased by $3 million related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments.

During 2013, identifiable intangible assets increased by $113 million and are being amortized over estimated lives ranging generally from three to 15 years. During 2012, there were no changes in
identifiable intangible assets. During 2011, indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets increased by $269 million. Indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets are not amortized, but all identifiable intangible assets are subject to annual
impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.

Deferred Loan Costs

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of deferred loan costs at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $542 million and
$571 million, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $305 million and $281 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is included in interest expense and was $55 million, $62 million and
$70 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Physician Recruiting Agreements

In order to recruit physicians to meet the needs of our hospitals and the communities they serve, we enter into minimum
revenue guarantee arrangements to assist the recruited physicians during the period they are relocating and establishing their practices. A guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
stand-ready obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. We expense the total estimated guarantee liability amount at the time the physician recruiting agreement becomes effective as we are not able to justify recording a contract-based asset
based upon our analysis of the related control, regulatory and legal considerations.

The physician recruiting
liability amount of $15 million at both December 31, 2013 and 2012 represents the amount of expense recognized in excess of payments made through December 31, 2013 and 2012. At December 31, 2013 the maximum amount we could have to pay
under all effective minimum revenue guarantees was $39 million.

Professional Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.279 billion and $1.297 billion at December 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively. The current portion of the reserves, $331 million and $324 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were $314 million, $331 million and $244 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are included in “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income statements.
Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the
respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and
frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results. The reserves for
professional liability risks cover approximately 2,600 individual claims and 2,700 individual claims at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims
can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2013 and 2012, $307 million and $335 million, respectively, of net payments were made for professional and general liability claims. The
estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there
can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates.

A portion of our professional
liability risks is insured through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per
occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers
for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance
and excess insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance and excess insurance
contracts. The amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include $19 million and $17 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, recorded in “other assets”, and $5 million and $32 million at
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, recorded in “other current assets”.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate and foreign
currency exposures, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting,
and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally, changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, along with the changes in the fair value of the hedged items
related to the hedged risk. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the
forecasted transactions when they

F-14

Financial
Instruments (continued)

occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings and generally the
derivative is terminated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting
from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt originally associated with the terminated swap.

Electronic Health Record Incentive Payments

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for eligible
hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon
when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is
available.

Medicaid EHR incentive calculations and related payment amounts are based upon prior period cost
report information available at the time our eligible hospitals adopt, implement or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period, and are not subject to revision for cost report data filed for a subsequent period.
Thus, incentive income recognition occurs at the point our eligible hospitals adopt, implement or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period, as the cost report information for the full cost report year that
will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is known at that time.

Medicare EHR incentive
calculations and related initial payment amounts are based upon the most current filed cost report information available at the time our eligible hospitals demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period. However,
unlike Medicaid, this initial payment amount will be adjusted based upon an updated calculation using the annual cost report information for the cost report period that began during the applicable payment year. Thus, incentive income recognition
occurs at the point our eligible hospitals demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive
payment is available.

We recognized $216 million ($183 million Medicare and $33 million Medicaid),
$336 million ($252 million Medicare and $84 million Medicaid) and $210 million ($123 million Medicare and $87 million Medicaid) of electronic health record incentive income during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $78 million and $113 million, respectively, of deferred EHR incentive income, which represent initial incentive payments received for which EHR incentive income has not been recognized.

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities.

Stock Incentive Plan

The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Holdings Inc. and its Affiliates, as Amended and Restated (the “Stock Incentive Plan”) is designed to promote the long term financial
interests and growth of the Company by attracting and retaining management and other personnel and to motivate them to achieve long range goals and further the alignment of interests of participants with those of our stockholders through
opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in the Company. Portions of the options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted share units (“RSUs”) granted under the Stock Incentive Plan vest solely based
upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and portions of the options, SARs and RSUs vest based both upon continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the achievement of predetermined financial targets over time. We
granted 4,864,000 and 6,348,000 SARs and 4,858,800 and 4,647,400 RSUs under the Stock Incentive Plan during 2013 and 2012, respectively. At December 31, 2013, there were 25,088,200 stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable, and there
were 32,269,100 shares available for future grants under the Stock Incentive Plan.

Stock Option, SAR and RSU Activity

The fair value of each stock option and SAR award is estimated on the grant date, using valuation models
and the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards under the Stock Incentive Plan generally vest based on continued employment (“Time Stock Options and SARs” and “Time RSUs”) and based upon achievement
of certain financial targets (“Performance Stock Options and SARs” and “Performance RSUs”). Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal to the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. We use
historical exercise behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of the options and SARs. The expected term of the share-based award is limited by the contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior is incorporated
in the historical exercise behavior data.

Stock
Option, SAR and RSU Activity (continued)

Compensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution method.
The straight-line attribution method requires that total compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is derived using historical stock price information for our common
stock and that of certain peer group companies. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected share-based award life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate
of the number of years a share-based award will be held before it is exercised.

HealthONE Acquisition (continued)

The total cost of the HealthONE acquisition has been allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values in accordance with ASC No. 805,

Business Combinations

. The purchase price represented a premium over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets acquired due to the value of the expected cash flows and HealthONE’s assembled workforce.

We identified and analyzed the acquired fixed assets, contracts, contractual commitments and legal contingencies to record the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, resulting in
goodwill of $2.261 billion being recorded as of December 31, 2011. We also recorded a gain of $1.522 billion related to this acquisition due to the remeasurement of our previous equity investment in HealthONE, based upon our acquisition of the
Foundation’s ownership interest and the resulting consolidation of the entire enterprise at estimated fair value. During 2012, we recorded final adjustments to the purchase price allocation which resulted in a $30 million increase to
noncontrolling interests, a $26 million reduction to property and equipment and a $56 million increase to goodwill. The amount of tax deductible goodwill is $981 million.

A summary of the final purchase price allocation, including assumed liabilities, follows (dollars in millions):

revenues, the deductibility of certain debt retirement costs and our method for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $462 million, including accrued interest of $30 million and excluding $13 million that was recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax
assets, as of December 31, 2013 ($426 million, $14 million and $13 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2012). Unrecognized tax benefits of $160 million ($125 million as of December 31, 2012) would
affect the effective rate, if recognized.

Depending on the resolution of any IRS disputes, the completion of
examinations by federal, state or international taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate obligations
to fixed interest rate obligations. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. The net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing of the related liabilities, for the
interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related
to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.

The following table sets forth our interest rate swap agreements, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, at

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

Accounting Standards Codification 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC
820”) emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As
a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the
reporting entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets, as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable

F-25


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)

inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the
fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value
measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

Cash Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or
alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash traded instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price
transparency. The valuation of these securities involves management’s judgment, after consideration of market factors and the absence of market transparency, market liquidity and observable inputs. Our valuation models derived fair market
values compared to tax-equivalent yields of other securities of similar credit worthiness and similar effective maturities.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate and cross currency swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency risks. The valuation of these instruments is determined
using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable
market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied volatilities. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the
respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although we determined the
majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to
evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. We assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions, and at December 31, 2013 and 2012, we
determined the credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

NOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT

A summary of long-term debt at December 31, including related interest rates at December 31, 2013, follows
(dollars in millions):

2013 Activity

During March 2013, we redeemed all $201 million aggregate principal amount of our 9


/


% senior secured second lien notes due 2017, at a redemption price of 104.938% of the principal amount. The pretax loss on retirement of debt related to this redemption was $17 million.

During November 2013, our $329 million senior secured European term loan facility matured.

2012 Activity

During February 2012, we issued $1.350 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior secured first lien notes due 2022. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the proceeds for
general corporate purposes.

During October 2012, we replaced our $2.000 billion senior secured revolving
credit facility maturing on November 17, 2015, with a new facility on substantially the same terms other than foregoing a scheduled increase in interest rates and extending the maturity date to November 17, 2016.

During October 2012, we issued $2.500 billion aggregate principal amount of notes, comprised of $1.250 billion of 4.75%
senior secured first lien notes due 2023 and $1.250 billion of 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2023. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes.

During December 2012, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due 2021. After
the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the proceeds to pay a distribution to our stockholders and holders of certain vested stock awards.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities And Other First Lien Debt

We have entered into the following senior secured credit facilities: (i) a $2.500 billion asset-based revolving
credit facility maturing on September 30, 2016 with a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and eligibility criteria ($2.440 billion outstanding at December 31, 2013) (the

“ABL credit facility”); (ii) a $2.000 billion senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on November 17, 2016 (none outstanding at December 31, 2013 without giving
effect to certain outstanding letters of credit); (iii) a $512 million senior secured term loan A-2 facility maturing on May 2, 2016; (iv) a $724 million senior secured term loan A-4 facility maturing on February 2, 2016;
(v) a $2.367 billion senior secured term loan B-4 facility maturing on May 1, 2018; and (vi) a $1.995 billion senior secured term loan B-5 facility maturing on March 31, 2017. We refer to the facilities described under
(ii) through (vi) above, collectively, as the “cash flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit facility, the “senior secured credit facilities.”

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a
base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period, plus, in each
case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios.

The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and
some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends
and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the ABL credit
facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant.

Senior secured first lien notes
consist of (i) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 8

indebtedness. Capital leases and other secured debt totaled $448 million at December 31, 2013.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate exposure of our debt portfolio. At December 31, 2013, we had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a total notional
amount of $4.500 billion, in order to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the senior secured credit facilities. The effect of the interest rate swaps is reflected in the effective interest rates
for the senior secured credit facilities.

Senior Unsecured Notes

Senior unsecured notes consist of (i) $6.541 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities
ranging from 2014 to 2033; (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $246 million medium-term notes with maturities ranging from 2014 to 2025; (iii) an aggregate principal amount of $886 million debentures with maturities ranging from 2015 to
2095; (iv) an aggregate principal amount of $1.525 billion senior notes due 2021 issued by HCA Holdings, Inc.; (v) an aggregate principal amount of $1.000 billion senior notes due 2021 issued by HCA Holdings, Inc.; and

NOTE 9 — LONG-TERM DEBT (continued)

General Debt Information

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially
all existing and future, direct and indirect, 100% owned material domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted Subsidiaries” under our Indenture (the “1993 Indenture”) dated December 16, 1993 (except for certain special
purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under our ABL credit facility).

All
obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and each guarantor
under such ABL credit facility (the “Receivables Collateral”).

All obligations under the cash flow
credit facility and the guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted liens and other exceptions, by:

•

a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc., or by any U.S. guarantor, in each of their respective first-tier subsidiaries;

•

a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future assets of HCA Inc. and of each U.S. guarantor other than (i) “Principal
Properties” (as defined in the 1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts, cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other exceptions; and

•

a second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral.

Our senior secured first lien notes and the related guarantees are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted
liens, on our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to certain exceptions, that secure our cash flow credit facility on a first-priority basis and are secured by second-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on our and our
subsidiary guarantors’ assets that secure our ABL credit facility on a first-priority basis and our other cash flow credit facility on a second-priority basis.

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2015 through 2018, excluding amounts under the ABL credit facility, are $1.065
million, $2.282 billion, $2.028 billion and $2.803 billion, respectively.

NOTE 10 — CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL CLAIM COSTS

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and
legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful
restriction of, or interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and
regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal
False Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some
states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our

F-31

NOTE 10 — CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL CLAIM COSTS (continued)

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation (continued)

individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending
on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

As initially disclosed in 2010, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has contacted the
Company in connection with its nationwide review of whether, in certain cases, hospital charges to the federal government relating to implantable cardio-defibrillators (“ICDs”) met the CMS criteria. In connection with this nationwide
review, the DOJ has indicated that it will be reviewing certain ICD billing and medical records at 95 HCA hospitals; the review covers the period from October 2003 to the present. In August 2012, HCA, along with non-HCA hospitals across the country
subject to the DOJ’s review, received from the DOJ a proposed framework for resolving the DOJ’s review of ICDs. The Company is cooperating in the review. The review could potentially give rise to claims against the Company under the
federal FCA or other statutes, regulations or laws. At this time, we cannot predict what effect, if any, this review or any resulting claims could have on the Company.

In July 2012, the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Miami requested information on reviews assessing
the medical necessity of interventional cardiology services provided at any Company facility (other than peer reviews). The Company is cooperating with the government’s request and has produced medical records associated with particular
reviews at eight hospitals, located primarily in Florida. At this time, we cannot predict what effect, if any, the request or any resulting claims, including any potential claims under the federal FCA, other statutes, regulations or laws, could
have on the Company.

Securities Class Action Litigation

On October 28, 2011, a shareholder action, Schuh v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al., was filed in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee seeking monetary relief. The case sought to include as a class all persons who acquired the Company’s stock pursuant or traceable to the Company’s Registration Statement issued in
connection with the March 9, 2011 initial public offering. The lawsuit asserted a claim under Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the Company, certain members of the board of directors, and certain underwriters in the
offering. It further asserted a claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the same members of the board of directors. The action alleged various deficiencies in the Company’s disclosures in the Registration Statement.
Subsequently, two additional class action complaints, Kishtah v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al. and Daniels v. HCA Holdings, Inc. et al., setting forth substantially similar claims against substantially the same defendants were filed in the same
federal court on November 16, 2011 and December 12, 2011, respectively. All three of the cases were consolidated. On May 3, 2012, the court appointed New England Teamsters & Trucking Industry Pension Fund as Lead Plaintiff
for the consolidated action. On July 13, 2012, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 against the Company, certain members of the board of directors, and
certain underwriters in the offering. It further asserts a claim under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 against the same members of the board of directors and Hercules Holdings II, LLC, a majority shareholder of the Company at the time
of the initial public offering. The consolidated complaint alleges deficiencies in the Company’s disclosures in the Registration Statement and Prospectus relating to: (1) the accounting for the Company’s 2006 recapitalization and 2010
reorganization; (2) the Company’s failure to maintain effective internal controls relating to its accounting for such transactions; and (3) the Company’s Medicare and Medicaid revenue growth rates. The Company and other
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on September 11, 2012. The Court granted the motion in part on May 28, 2013. The action is proceeding to discovery on the remaining claims.

Securities Class Action Litigation (continued)

In addition to the above described shareholder class actions, on
December 8, 2011, a federal shareholder derivative action, Sutton v. Bracken, et al., putatively initiated in the name of the Company, was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee against certain officers
and present and former directors of the Company seeking monetary relief. The action alleges breaches of fiduciary duties by the named officers and directors in connection with the accounting and earnings claims set forth in the shareholder class
actions. Setting forth substantially similar claims against substantially the same defendants, an additional federal derivative action, Schroeder v. Bracken, et al., was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee
on December 16, 2011, and a state derivative action, Bagot v. Bracken, et al., was filed in Tennessee state court in the Davidson County Circuit Court on December 20, 2011. The federal derivative actions were consolidated in the Middle
District of Tennessee and stayed pending developments in the shareholder class actions. The state derivative action had also been stayed pending developments in the shareholder class actions, but that stay has expired. The plaintiff in the state
derivative action subsequently filed an amended complaint on September 9, 2013 that added additional allegations made in the shareholder class actions. On September 24, 2013, an additional state derivative action, Steinberg v. Bracken, et
al., was filed in Tennessee state court in the Davidson County Circuit Court. This action against our board of directors has been consolidated with the earlier filed state derivative action. The plaintiffs in the consolidated action filed a
consolidated complaint on December 4, 2013. The Company has filed a motion to again stay the state derivative action pending developments in the class action, but the Court has not yet acted on that motion.

Health Midwest Litigation

In October 2009, the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against HCA Inc. in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri and alleged that HCA did not
fund the level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA’s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central issue in the case was whether HCA’s construction of new hospitals counted
towards its $450 million five-year capital commitments. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. On January 24, 2013, the Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and
awarded at least $162 million. The Court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA’s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care during the ten years following the purchase. Should the
accounting fail to satisfy the Court concerning HCA’s compliance with its capital and charity care commitments, the amount of the judgment award could substantially increase. The Court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees,
which the parties have stipulated are about $12 million. HCA recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling. The accounting for HCA’s capital expenditures and charity and uncompensated care is
ongoing and will likely not be concluded before the fourth quarter of 2014. HCA plans to appeal the trial court’s ruling on the breach of contract claim and order for the accounting once the trial court rules on the accounting and enters final
judgment.

NOTE 11 — LEASES

We lease medical office buildings and certain equipment under operating lease agreements. Commitments
relating to noncancellable operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in millions):

NOTE 12 — CAPITAL STOCK

The amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue up to
1,800,000,000 shares of common stock, and our amended and restated by-laws set the number of directors constituting the board of directors of the Company at not less than three members, the exact number to be determined from time to time by
resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of directors then in office.

During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87,719,300 shares of our common stock at a price of
$30.00 per share and realized net proceeds (after costs of the offering) of $2.506 billion. During September 2011, we repurchased 80,771,143 shares of our common stock beneficially owned by affiliates of Bank of America Corporation at a
purchase price of $18.61 per share, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 14, 2011. The shares repurchased represented approximately 15.6% of our total shares outstanding at the time of
the repurchase. During November 2013, we repurchased 10,656,436 shares of our common stock at a price of $46.92 per share.

Distributions

During 2012, our Board of Directors declared three distributions to the Company’s stockholders and holders of certain vested share-based awards. The distributions totaled $6.50 per share and vested
share-based award (subject to limitations for certain awards), or $3.142 billion in the aggregate. Pursuant to the terms of our share-based award plans, the holders of nonvested stock options and SARs received $6.50 per share reductions to the
exercise price of the applicable share-based awards (subject to certain limitations for certain share-based awards that resulted in deferred distributions for a portion of the declared distribution, which will be paid upon the vesting of the
applicable share-based award). The holders of nonvested RSUs will be paid the applicable distribution amounts upon the vesting of the applicable RSUs. There were no distributions declared during 2013 and 2011.

NOTE 13 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain contributory, defined contribution benefit plans that are available to employees who meet
certain minimum requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match specified percentages of participant

F-34

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 13 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS (continued)

contributions up to certain maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending upon years of vesting service, of compensation deferred by participants). The cost of these plans
totaled $374 million for 2013, $371 million for 2012 and $322 million for 2011. Our contributions are funded periodically during each year.

We maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan to provide certain retirement benefits for eligible employees. Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning eligible
compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base and attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan year. Company credits to participants’ account balances (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon participants’
compensation, years of vesting service and certain IRS limitations related to the HCA 401(k) plan. Benefits expense under this plan was $29 million for 2013, $20 million for 2012 and $25 million for 2011. Accrued benefits liabilities
under this plan totaled $137 million at December 31, 2013 and $120 million at December 31, 2012.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the value of a prescribed life
annuity from the combination of the SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the plan was $43 million for 2013, $51 million for 2012 and $33 million for 2011. Accrued benefits liabilities under this plan totaled
$214 million at December 31, 2013 and $242 million at December 31, 2012.

We maintain
defined benefit pension plans which resulted from certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Benefits expense under these plans was $37 million for 2013, $49 million for 2012, and $39 million for 2011. Accrued benefits liabilities
under these plans totaled $81 million at December 31, 2013 and $196 million at December 31, 2012.

NOTE 14 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals and related health care entities.
Effective January 1, 2013, we reorganized our operational groups into two geographically organized groups: the National and American Groups. The acquired HealthONE operating results have been included in the American Group operating results for
periods subsequent to November 1, 2011. Prior to November 1, 2011, the American Group recorded its share of the HealthONE operating results in equity in earnings of affiliates.

At December 31, 2013, the National Group included 82 hospitals located in Alaska, California, Florida, southern
Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia, and the American Group included 77 hospitals located in Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. We also operate six hospitals in England, and these facilities are included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs, gain on
acquisition of controlling interest in equity investment, termination of management agreement, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating
resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted
segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial
performance. Because

(“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes described in Note 9. Rule 3-16 of
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class of securities registered or being
registered. We believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure relationship of HCA and Healthtrust,
HCA’s operating subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust. The corporate structure relationship, combined with the application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s consolidated financial statements related to
HCA’s debt and financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated financial statements of HCA and Healthtrust
present the identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, total stockholders’ deficit, net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.
Certain individual line items in the HCA consolidated statements of stockholders’ deficit are combined into one line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of stockholder’s deficit.

Due to the consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical
to the consolidated financial statements of HCA, except for the items presented in the table above, the separate consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust are not presented.
