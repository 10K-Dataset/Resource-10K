PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in
the United States. At December 31, 2004, the Company
operated 189 hospitals, comprised of 174 general, acute care
hospitals; seven psychiatric hospitals; one rehabilitation
hospital; and seven hospitals (one of which is a rehabilitation
hospital) included in joint ventures, which are accounted for
using the equity method. In addition, the Company operated 92
freestanding surgery centers, eight of which are accounted for
using the equity method. The Company’s facilities are
located in 23 states, England and Switzerland. The terms
“Company” and “HCA,” as used herein, refer
to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise stated or
indicated by context. The term “affiliates” means
direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and partnerships
and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. The
terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to
entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and references
to “employees” refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.

HCA’s primary objective is to provide the communities it
serves a comprehensive array of quality health care services in
the most cost-effective manner possible. HCA’s general,
acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services
to accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine,
general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics
and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic and emergency services.
Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by
HCA’s general, acute care hospitals and through HCA’s
freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and
rehabilitation facilities. HCA’s psychiatric hospitals
provide a full range of mental health care services through
inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. HCA’s
principal executive offices are located at One Park Plaza,
Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and its telephone number is
(615) 344-9551.

Business Strategy

HCA is committed to providing the communities it serves high
quality, cost-effective health care while maintaining
consistency with HCA’s ethics and compliance program,
governmental regulations and guidelines, and industry standards.
As a part of this strategy, HCA’s management focuses on the
following areas:

Health Care Facilities

HCA currently owns, manages or operates hospitals; freestanding
surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2004, HCA owned and operated 174 general,
acute care hospitals with 41,158 licensed beds, and an
additional six general, acute care hospitals with 2,103 licensed
beds are operated through joint ventures, which are accounted
for using the equity method. Most of HCA’s general, acute
care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including
inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic
services and emergency services. The general, acute care
hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient
surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology
and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical
staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up
of members of the local community.

Like most hospitals, HCA’s hospitals do not engage in
extensive medical research and education programs. However, some
of HCA’s hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and
may participate in the clinical rotation of medical interns and
residents and other education programs.

At December 31, 2004, HCA operated seven psychiatric
hospitals with 630 licensed beds. HCA’s psychiatric
hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child,
adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent
alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

Outpatient health care facilities operated by HCA include
freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers,
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
integral component of HCA’s strategy to develop
comprehensive health care networks in select communities.

In addition to providing capital resources, HCA affiliates
provide a variety of management services to its health care
facilities, including patient safety programs; ethics and
compliance programs; national supply contracts; equipment
purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting, financial and
clinical systems; governmental reimbursement assistance;
construction planning and coordination; information technology
systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resource services;
and internal audit.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
depending on the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical,
intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of
the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various
reasons, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.



HCA receives payment for patient services from the Federal
government primarily under the Medicare program, state
governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs,
managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients.
The approximate percentages of the Company’s patient
revenues from such sources were as follows:

(a)

Prior to 2004, managed Medicaid revenues were classified as
    either Medicaid or managed care.

Medicare is a Federal program that provides certain hospital and
medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
Medicaid is a Federal-state program, administered by the states,
which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying
individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of
HCA’s general, acute hospitals located in the United States
are certified as health care services providers for persons
covered under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts
received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally
significantly less than the hospitals’ established gross
charges for the services provided.

HCA’s hospitals generally offer discounts from established
charges to certain group purchasers of health care services,
including Blue Cross, other private insurance companies,
employers, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans. These
discount programs limit HCA’s ability to increase revenues
in response to increasing costs. See Item 1,
“Business — Competition.” Patients are
generally not responsible for the total difference between
established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for
such services under Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross plans, HMOs
or PPOs, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions,
deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The
amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance has been
increasing each year. Collection of amounts due from individuals
is typically more difficult than from governmental or
third-party payers. In 2003, HCA implemented changes to its
uninsured care policies, to provide financial relief to more of
its uninsured patients. On January 1, 2005, HCA modified
its policies to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do
not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
implementing the discount policy, HCA will first attempt to
qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other Federal or state
assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount will be
applied. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Results of Operations —
Revenue/ Volume Trends.”

Medicare

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, HCA receives reimbursement under a
prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
care hospital inpatient services. Under hospital inpatient PPS,
fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established
based on the patient’s assigned diagnosis related group
(“DRG”). DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources
necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. DRG
weights represent the average resources for a given DRG relative
to the average resources for all DRGs. When the cost to treat
certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution,
providers typically receive additional “outlier”
payments. DRG payments do not consider a specific
hospital’s cost, but are adjusted for area wage
differentials. Hospitals, other than those



defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for
inpatient capital costs based on DRG weights multiplied by a
geographically adjusted Federal rate.

DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are recalibrated each
Federal fiscal year. The index used to update the DRG rates (the
“market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation
experienced by hospitals and entities outside of the health care
industry in purchasing goods and services. However, for several
years the percentage increases to the DRG rates have been lower
than the percentage increases in the costs of goods and services
purchased by hospitals. In Federal fiscal year 2004, the DRG
rate increase was market basket of 3.4%. For Federal fiscal year
2005, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) set the DRG rate increase at full market
basket of 3.3%. Through recent legislation, including the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act
of 2003 (“MMA”), Congress equalized the DRG payment
rate for urban and rural hospitals at the large urban rate for
all hospitals for discharges on or after April 1, 2003.
Further, MMA provides for DRG rate increases for Federal fiscal
years 2005, 2006, and 2007 at full market basket, if data for
ten patient care quality indicators is submitted to the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Those
hospitals not submitting data on the ten quality indicators will
receive an increase equal to the market basket rate minus 0.4%.
All HCA hospitals paid under Medicare inpatient DRG PPS are
participating in the quality initiative by the Secretary of HHS
by submitting the quality data requested. Although MMA provides
for a full market basket update for fiscal year 2006, the
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”)
recently recommended that Congress update inpatient PPS payments
for fiscal year 2006 by the market basket minus 0.4%. It is
uncertain whether Congress will adopt this recommendation.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.1% of
Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. During
Federal fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, the CMS payments for
cost outlier cases exceeded the 5.1% set aside. Outlier payments
are made by CMS for those DRG cases where the cost of the case
exceeds the total DRG payments plus a fixed threshold amount.
CMS increased the threshold from $16,350 at the end of Federal
fiscal year 2001, to $21,025 for 2002, and $33,560 for 2003. In
June 2003, CMS adopted significant regulatory changes to outlier
payments. Included in the regulatory changes were provisions to:
(1) use the most recent settled cost report to establish
the hospital’s cost-to-charge ratio, (2) eliminate the
use of the statewide average when the hospital’s
cost-to-charge ratio falls three standard deviations below the
national average, and (3) permit CMS to reconcile outlier
payments in the Medicare cost report for hospitals meeting CMS
defined audit criteria. As a result of these changes, CMS set
the outlier threshold at $31,000 for Federal fiscal year 2004.
CMS estimates that outlier payments will be 3.5% of total
operating DRG payments for the Federal fiscal year 2004, which
is 31.4% below the 5.1% projected set aside. For the Federal
fiscal year 2005, CMS revised its methodology to more fully
reflect the regulatory changes adopted in June 2003. For the
Federal fiscal year 2005, CMS has established an outlier
threshold of $25,800, using the revised methodology. Decreasing
the outlier threshold in Federal fiscal year 2005 will increase
both the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments and
the amount of payments for qualifying outlier cases, compared to
Federal fiscal year 2004; however, outlier payments are not
expected to return to Federal fiscal year 2003 and prior payment
levels.

In order to calculate whether outlier payments are due, the
Medicare fiscal intermediary multiplies the hospital’s
billed (or gross) charges on each Medicare claim by its
cost-to-charge ratio from the most recent settled Medicare cost
report. The product of that calculation is considered the cost
of the claim. An outlier payment is made for 80% of such costs
in excess of the sum of the total DRG payments for that claim
plus the fixed threshold amount ($25,800 for Federal fiscal year
2005).

HCA recorded $124 million, $221 million and
$284 million of revenues related to Medicare operating
outlier cases for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These
amounts represent 2.0%, 3.7% and 5.1% of HCA’s Medicare
revenues and 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.4% of HCA’s total revenues
for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There can be no
assurances that HCA will continue to receive these levels of
Medicare outlier payments in future periods.



Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS-basis. CMS has
continued to use existing fee schedules to pay for physical,
occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment,
clinical diagnostic laboratory services and nonimplantable
orthotics and prosthetics. Freestanding surgery centers and
independent diagnostic testing facilities, including imaging
centers, are reimbursed on a fee schedule.

All PPS hospital outpatient services that are paid under PPS are
classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications
(“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2003 and
2004 by market basket of 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively. The update
for calendar year 2005 is market basket of 3.3%. MedPAC recently
recommended that Congress update outpatient PPS payments for
fiscal year 2006 by a conversion factor equal to the market
basket minus 0.4%. It is uncertain whether Congress will adopt
this recommendation.

Rehabilitation

PPS for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”)
was implemented for Medicare cost reporting periods beginning on
or after October 1, 2002. Under PPS, patients are
classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
comorbidities and functional capability. Inpatient
rehabilitation facilities are paid a predetermined amount per
discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group and is
adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas
and high-cost outliers. For Federal fiscal years 2003 and 2004,
CMS updated the PPS rate for rehabilitation hospitals and units
by market basket of 3.0% and 3.2%, respectively. For Federal
fiscal year 2005, CMS has updated the PPS rate for IRFs by
market basket of 3.1%. As of December 31, 2004, HCA had two
rehabilitation hospitals, one of which is operated through a
joint venture, and 55 hospital rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
criteria for being classified as an inpatient rehabilitation
facility, commonly known as the “75 percent
rule”. CMS revised the medical conditions for patients
served by rehabilitation facilities from ten medical conditions
to thirteen conditions. The final rule provides for a transition
to targeting payments to facilities that treat a large share of
patients with diagnoses likely to require intensive
rehabilitation. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 2004, and before July 1, 2005, the compliance
threshold is set at 50% of the IRF’s total patient
population. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 2005, and before July 1, 2006, the compliance
threshold is set at 60% of the IRF’s total patient
population. For cost reporting periods beginning on or after
July 1, 2006, and before July 1, 2007, the compliance
threshold is set at 65% of the IRF’s total patient
population. The compliance threshold will be set at 75% for cost
reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 2007. In
2004, Congress enacted legislation preventing CMS from enforcing
the final rule until the General Accountability Office completes
a study on the rule’s impact on IRFs and patients. Full
implementation of the 75 percent rule can be expected to
significantly restrict the treatment of patients whose medical
conditions do not meet the thirteen approved conditions.

Medicare fiscal intermediaries have been given the authority to
develop and implement Local Coverage Determination
(“LCD”) to determine the medical necessity of care
rendered to Medicare patients where there is no national
coverage determination. A consortium of Medicare fiscal
intermediaries has been working together to develop a
restrictive LCD on rehabilitation care. Some intermediaries are
starting to finalize their LCDs for rehabilitation services. A
restrictive rehabilitation LCD has the potential to
significantly impact Medicare rehabilitation payments. The
financial impact to HCA of any final rehabilitation LCD is
uncertain.

Psychiatric

Payments to PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals and units are based
upon reasonable cost, subject to a cost-per-discharge target
(the TEFRA limits) for cost reporting periods beginning before
January 1, 2005. These limits are updated annually by a
market basket index. The update to a hospital’s target
amount for its



cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal years 2003 and 2004
was market basket of 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively. CMS has
updated the target amount by market basket of 3.3% for Federal
fiscal year 2005. Caps had been established for the
cost-per-discharge target at the 75th percentile for each
category of PPS-exempt hospitals and units. For cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, payments to
these PPS-exempt hospitals and units are no longer subject to
these caps. However, if a PPS-exempt hospital or unit was
subject to the cap in the cost report for the year prior to
October 1, 2002, such limitation will be included in its
future target amount. The cost-per-discharge for new hospitals
and hospital units cannot exceed 110% of the national median
target rate for hospitals in the same category.

On November 15, 2004, CMS published a final regulation to
implement a PPS for inpatient hospital services furnished in
psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute
care hospitals and critical access hospitals (“IPF
PPS”). The new prospective payment system replaces the
cost-based system for reporting periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2005. IPF PPS is a per diem prospective payment
system with adjustments to account for certain patient and
facility characteristics. IPF PPS contains an
“outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and
an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains
a full-service emergency department. IPF PPS is being
implemented over a three-year transition period with full
payment under PPS to begin in the fourth year. Also, CMS has
included a stop-loss provision to ensure that hospitals avoid
significant losses during the transition. CMS has established
the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget
neutral and has adopted a July 1 update cycle. Thus, the
initial IPF PPS per diem payment rate will be effective for the
18-month period January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006.
As of December 31, 2004, HCA had seven psychiatric
hospitals and 41 hospital psychiatric units.

Skilled Nursing Facilities

CMS has established a PPS for Medicare skilled nursing
facilities under which facilities are paid a per diem rate for
virtually all covered services. The skilled nursing facilities
PPS payment rates were updated for Federal fiscal year 2004 by
market basket of 3.0% and by a positive market basket forecast
error adjustment of 3.26%. For Federal fiscal year 2005, the PPS
payment rates were updated by market basket of 2.8%. As of
December 31, 2004, HCA had 22 skilled nursing units.

Other

Under PPS, the prospective payment rates are adjusted for the
area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage
index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the
geographic area compared to the national average wage level.
Effective October 1, 2004 for inpatient PPS and
January 1, 2005 for outpatient PPS, CMS implemented a
number of changes to the wage index calculation. These changes
include adopting new standards for defining labor market
geographic areas based on standards for defining Core-Based
Statistical Areas (“CBSA”) issued by the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”). Hospitals that will be
harmed by this new definition will receive a blended (50/50)
wage index based on the old and new wage geographic definitions
for one year. Further, CMS has applied an occupational mix
adjustment factor to the wage index amounts for the first time,
but has limited the adjustment to 10% of the wage index. CMS has
not announced what percentage of the wage index will be impacted
by the occupational mix adjustment for future years. CMS has
also lowered the labor share for inpatient PPS payment from
71.1% to 62% unless the lower percentage would result in lower
payments to the hospital. This change, in effect, increases
payments for all hospitals whose wage index is less than 1.0.
The geographic definition changes and the occupational mix
adjustment have not been applied to the rehabilitation, skilled
nursing facility and psychiatric prospective payment systems at
this time. The financial impact, if any, that these changes will
have upon the Company beyond 2005 is uncertain.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the Federal government
and the states and are administered by states under approved
plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual
hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a
hospital’s cost of services. The Federal government and
many states are currently considering altering the level of



Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
eligibility that could adversely affect future levels of
Medicaid reimbursement received by HCA’s hospitals. As
permitted by law, certain states in which HCA operates have
adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund their Medicaid
programs.

Managed Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs relate to situations where states
contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care
management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not
abdicate program responsibilities for financing, eligibility
criteria and core benefit plan design. HCA generally contracts
directly with one of the designated entities, usually a managed
care organization. The provisions of these programs are state
specific.

Uninsured

HCA also provides services to patients who are not covered by
insurance or by the Medicare, Medicaid or other programs. HCA
provides care to patients who are financially unable to pay for
the health care services they receive, and because HCA does not
pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity
care, they are not reported in revenues. In the first quarter of
2003, the Company announced that patients treated at an HCA
wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care who have income at or
below 200% of the Federal poverty level are eligible for charity
care, a standard HCA estimates that 70% of its hospitals were
previously using. The Federal poverty level is established by
the Federal government and is based on income and family size.
On January 1, 2005, HCA modified its policies to provide a
discount to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid
or charity care. These discounts are similar to those provided
to many local managed care plans. In implementing the discount
policy, HCA will first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for
Medicaid, other Federal or state assistance or charity care. If
an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
uninsured discount will be applied.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
revenue, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to
HCA under these reimbursement programs. These audits often
require several years to reach the final determination of
amounts due to or from HCA under these programs. Providers also
have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised
in audits of prior years’ reports.

In June 2003, HCA announced that the Company and the Civil
Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) had
signed agreements whereby the United States would dismiss the
various claims it had brought related to physician relations,
cost reports and wound care issues (the “DOJ
Agreement”). The DOJ Agreement received court approval in
July 2003, and HCA paid the DOJ $641 million (including
accrued interest of $10 million) during July 2003. HCA also
finalized an agreement with a negotiating team representing
states that may have claims against HCA. Under this agreement,
HCA paid $17.7 million in July 2003 to state Medicaid
agencies to resolve these claims. HCA also paid $33 million
for legal fees of the private parties.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of HCA’s hospitals offer discounts from established
charges to certain large group purchasers of health care
services, including managed care plans, Blue Cross, other
private insurance companies and employers. HCA’s admissions
reimbursed by managed care and other discounted plans were 42%,
44% and 47% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Managed care contracts are



typically negotiated for two-year terms. While HCA has generally
received annual average price increases of seven to eight
percent from managed care payers during the previous two years,
there can be no assurance that HCA will continue to receive
increases in the future.

Hospital Utilization

HCA believes that the most important factors relating to the
overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number and quality of
physicians and other health care professionals providing patient
care within the facility. Generally, HCA believes that the
ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its
breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of
care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors
that impact utilization include the growth in local population,
local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care
programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
HCA hospitals. Hospital operations are subject to certain
seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient
utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold
weather months.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
most of HCA’s hospitals provide services similar to those
offered by HCA’s hospitals. Additionally, in the past
several years the number of freestanding surgery centers and
diagnostic centers (including facilities owned by physicians) in
the geographic areas in which HCA operates has increased
significantly. As a result, most of HCA’s hospitals operate
in an increasingly competitive environment. The rates charged by
HCA’s hospitals are intended to be competitive with those
charged by other local hospitals for similar services. In some
cases, competing hospitals are more established than HCA’s
hospitals. Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported
government agencies and many others by not-for-profit entities
that may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions
and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such
exemptions and support are not available to HCA’s
hospitals. In addition, in certain localities served by HCA
there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly
specialized facilities, equipment and services which may not be
available at most of HCA’s hospitals. HCA is facing
increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals
and freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin
services. Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from
areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional
hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute
care hospitals.

HCA’s strategies are designed to ensure HCA’s
hospitals are competitive. HCA believes that its hospitals
compete within local communities on the basis of many factors,
including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain
quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health
care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology
offered and prices charged. HCA has increased its focus on
operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and
more convenient service for patients, and increased
predictability and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may at any
time terminate their affiliation with a hospital operated by
HCA, the Company’s hospitals seek to retain physicians with
varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to
attract other qualified physicians. HCA believes that physicians
refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and
scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the
quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the
hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities,
equipment and employees. Accordingly, HCA strives to maintain
and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and
services for physicians and their patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
is management’s ability to negotiate service contracts with
purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans
attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and
obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges.
In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are
increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations
with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from
established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for
service contracts with group health care services purchasers on
the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location,
quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and
convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed
care organizations varies from community to community depending
on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
restricting competition. In those states which have no CON laws
or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they
become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form
of new services, facilities and capital spending is more
prevalent. See Item 1, “Business —
Regulation and Other Factors.”



HCA, and the health care industry as a whole, face the challenge
of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
and interpretations and competitive contracting for provider
services by private and government payers remain ongoing
challenges. These challenges may require changes in HCA’s
operations in the future.

Admissions and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively
affected by payer-required pre-admission authorization,
utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and
alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill
patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer
pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges,
HCA intends to expand many of its facilities or acquire or
construct new facilities to better enable the provision of a
comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer discounts to
private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and
offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
numerous Federal, state and local regulations relating to the
adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
for licensing and accreditation. HCA believes that its health
care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state
laws. All of HCA’s general, acute care hospitals are
certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs and are accredited by the Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“Joint
Commission”). Certain of HCA’s psychiatric hospitals
do not participate in these programs. If any facility were to
lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its
certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the
facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Management believes that
HCA’s facilities are in substantial compliance with current
applicable Federal, state, local and independent review body
regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure,
certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in
order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for HCA to
make changes in its facilities, equipment, personnel and
services.

Certificates of Need

In some states where HCA operates hospitals, the construction or
expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing
facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition
of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior
approval of state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such
laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine
the public need for additional or expanded health care
facilities and services. Failure to obtain necessary state
approval can result in the inability to expand facilities,
complete an acquisition or change ownership.

State Rate Review

Some states where HCA operates hospitals have adopted
legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or
have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or
licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In
the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions
have not materially, adversely affected HCA’s results of
operations.

Utilization Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that
services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients
meet professionally recognized standards and are medically
necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed.
These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of
admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by
quality improvement organizations to



assess the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient
admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the
validity of DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases
of extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality improvement
organizations may deny payment for services provided, may assess
fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department
of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider,
which is in substantial noncompliance with the appropriate
standards, be excluded from participating in the Medicare
program. Most nongovernmental managed care organizations also
require utilization review.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any Federal health care program, including the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
hospital’s participation in the Federal health care
programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
or both.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
“Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
paying, any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
or orders for services, or items covered by a Federal health
care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly.
Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a
criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or
imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of
the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Federal
health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and
Human Services (“OIG”), among other regulatory
agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud,
abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a
nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. In
order to provide guidance to health care providers, the OIG
issues “Special Fraud Alerts.” These alerts do not
have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or
transactions that may indicate that the arrangements or
transactions violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other Federal
health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive
arrangements, which, if accompanied by inappropriate intent,
constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any
incentive by the hospital each time a physician refers a patient
to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly
discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually
located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or
significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff
services, (d) free training for a physician’s office
staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory
techniques, (e) guarantees which provide that, if the
physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level,
the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder,
(f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may
be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital,
(g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and
expenses for conferences, (h) coverage on the
hospital’s group health insurance plans at an
inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for
services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which
require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician,
(j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices
in excess of their fair market value, or (k) certain
“gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of
giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s
costs for patient care attributable in part to the
physician’s efforts. The OIG has encouraged persons having
information about hospitals who offer the above types of
incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

In addition to issuing fraud alerts, the OIG from time to time
issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health
care providers. In January 2005, the OIG published Supplemental
Compliance Guidance for Hospitals, supplementing its 1998
guidance for the hospital industry. In the supplemental
guidance, the OIG identifies a number of risk areas under
Federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of
risk include compensation arrangements with physicians,
recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture
relationships with physicians.



As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
regulations that outline categories of activities that are
deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe
harbors for various activities, including the following:
investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management
contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that
conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe
harbor, or that it is identified in a fraud alert or as a risk
area in the Supplemental Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals,
does not automatically render the conduct or business
arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However,
such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased
scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. Although the
Company believes that its arrangements with physicians have been
structured to comply with current law and available
interpretations, there can be no assurance that regulatory
authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial
arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other
applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject the
Company to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including
criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care
programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
as the “Stark Law.” This law effectively prohibits
physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to
entities with which they or any of their immediate family
members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide
certain designated health services that are reimbursable by
Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment,
refunding amounts received for services provided pursuant to
prohibited referrals, civil monetary penalties of up to
$15,000 per prohibited service provided, and exclusion from
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute also provides
for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme.
There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many
of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and
providers, including employment contracts, leases and
recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a
physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, as
opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department.

In January 2001, CMS issued regulations intended to clarify
parts of the Stark Law and some of the exceptions to it. These
regulations are considered the first phase of a two-phase
process. The phase one regulations generally became effective
January 4, 2002. On March 26, 2004, CMS issued an
interim final rule subject to a comment period intended to
clarify the remaining portions of the Stark Law. These rules,
known as “phase two” of the Stark Law rulemaking,
became effective July 26, 2004. While these phase two rules
help clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark
Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret them for
enforcement purposes.

In 2003, Congress passed legislation that modifies the hospital
ownership exception to the Stark Law by creating an 18-month
moratorium on allowing physicians to own interests in new
specialty hospitals. During the moratorium, HHS is required to
conduct an analysis of specialty hospitals, including quality of
care provided and physician referral patterns to these
facilities. MedPAC will study cost and payment issues related to
specialty hospitals. The moratorium applies to hospitals that
primarily or exclusively treat cardiac, orthopedic or surgical
conditions or any other specialized category of patients or
cases designated by regulation, unless the hospitals were in
operation or development before November 18, 2003, do not
increase the number of physician investors, and meet certain
other requirements. The moratorium is scheduled to expire on
June 8, 2005. In January 2005, MedPAC adopted a
recommendation that Congress extend the moratorium for an
additional 18 months. HHS has not yet issued a report of
its analysis of specialty hospitals or issued recommendations.
It is uncertain how CMS will interpret this legislation, what
recommendations HHS will make regarding specialty hospitals, or
whether additional changes will be made to the hospital
ownership exception.



Similar State Laws

Many states in which HCA operates also have laws that prohibit
payments to physicians for patient referrals similar to the
Anti-kickback Statute and self-referral legislation similar to
the Stark Law. The scope of these state laws is broad, since
they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for
care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or
enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and
civil penalties as well as loss of facility licensure.

HIPAA and BBA-97

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and
abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care
fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA
also added a prohibition against incentives intended to
influence decisions by Medicare beneficiaries as to the provider
from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA
created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse,
including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive
program under which individuals can receive up to $1,000 for
providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to
the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds. Federal
enforcement officials now have the ability to exclude from
Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing
employees associated with business entities that have committed
health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had
no knowledge of the fraud. HIPAA was followed by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”), which created
additional fraud and abuse provisions, including civil penalties
for contracting with an individual or entity that the provider
knows or should know is excluded from a Federal health care
program.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil
penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and
Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing
for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
unnecessary goods and services, and cost report fraud. Criminal
and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other
prohibited activities, including failure to return known
overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, and offering
remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid
beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider. Like the
Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Careful
and accurate coding of claims for reimbursement, as well as
accurately preparing cost reports, must be performed to avoid
liability.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

A factor affecting the health care industry is the use of the
Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought by
individuals on the government’s behalf under the False
Claims Act’s “

qui tam

,” or whistleblower,
provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals
to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the
defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable
under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay
three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus
mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each
separate false claim. There are many potential bases for
liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises
when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement
to the Federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term
“knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not
give rise to liability under the False Claims Act, submitting a
claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
constitutes a “knowing” submission under the False
Claims Act and, therefore, will qualify for liability.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the Federal government have
taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated
other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark
Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False Claims
Act. A number of states in which HCA operates have adopted their
own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower
provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in
state court.



HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy
    Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
received electronically. These provisions are intended to
encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
became mandatory for HCA’s facilities in October 2003. HHS
has agreed to accept noncompliant Medicare claims, for an
unspecified time, to assist providers that are not yet able to
process compliant transactions. However, this extension may be
terminated by HHS and is not binding on private payers. In
February 2004, HHS announced that noncompliant claims received
by Medicare on or after July 1, 2004 will be paid no
earlier than the 27th day after such claims are received.
Compliant claims will continue to be paid no earlier than the
14th day after such claims are received. HCA believes that
the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position or results of operations.

HIPAA also requires HHS to adopt standards to protect the
privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related
information. HHS issued regulations containing privacy standards
and compliance with these regulations became mandatory during
April 2003. The privacy regulations regulate the use and
disclosure of individually identifiable health-related
information, whether communicated electronically, on paper or
orally. The regulations also provide patients with significant
new rights related to understanding and controlling how their
health information is used or disclosed. HHS released security
regulations in February 2003. The security regulations will
become mandatory during April 2005 and will require health care
providers to implement administrative, physical and technical
practices to protect the security of individually identifiable
health information that is maintained or transmitted
electronically. The privacy regulations and security
regulations, when fully implemented, could impose significant
costs on HCA’s facilities in order to comply with these
standards.

Violations of HIPAA could result in civil penalties of up to
$25,000 per type of violation in each calendar year and
criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. In
addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory
initiatives at the Federal and state levels addressing patient
privacy concerns. Facilities will continue to remain subject to
any Federal or state privacy-related laws that are more
restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA.
These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties.

EMTALA

All of HCA’s hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical
Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This
Federal law requires any hospital that participates in the
Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering
from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a
facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe
penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or
appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital
delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the
patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of
EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured
patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that
suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another
hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit
against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s
emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients
admitted for inpatient services. The government also has
expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA
violations actively in the future. The Company believes
HCA’s hospitals operate in substantial compliance with
EMTALA.



Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which HCA operates have laws that prohibit
corporations and other entities from employing physicians and
practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct
and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between
health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage
the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of,
particular providers for medical products and services. Possible
sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of
license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition,
agreements between the corporation and the physician may be
considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from
state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted
by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
years on the hospital industry. While HCA is currently not aware
of any material investigations of the Company, it is possible
that governmental entities could initiate investigations or
litigation in the future at facilities operated by HCA and that
such matters could result in significant penalties as well as
adverse publicity. It is also possible that HCA’s
executives and managers could be included in governmental
investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private
litigation.

The Company’s substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other
governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of its
operations. The Company continues to monitor all aspects of its
business and has developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance
program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable Federal
guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area
is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations
or litigation may result in interpretations that are
inconsistent with industry practices, including the
Company’s.

Health Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in the United
States and continues to attract much legislative interest and
public attention. In recent years, various legislative proposals
have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state
legislatures that would affect major changes in the health care
system, either nationally or at the state level. Many states
have enacted, or are considering enacting, measures designed to
reduce their Medicaid expenditures and change private health
care insurance. Most states, including the states in which HCA
operates, have applied for and been granted Federal waivers from
current Medicaid regulations to allow them to serve some or all
of their Medicaid participants through managed care providers.

Compliance Program and Corporate Integrity Agreement

HCA maintains a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
is designed to meet or exceed applicable Federal guidelines and
industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, HCA
provides annual ethics and compliance training to its employees
and encourages all employees to report any violations to their
supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
telephone ethics line.

In January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate
Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG. The CIA is
structured to assure the Federal government of HCA’s
overall Federal health care program compliance and specifically
covers DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and physician
relations. The CIA also included testing for outpatient
laboratory billing in 2001, which was replaced with skilled
nursing facilities billing in 2003. Under the CIA, HCA has an
affirmative obligation to report potential violations of
applicable Federal heath care laws and regulations and has,
pursuant to this obligation, reported a number of potential
violations of the Stark, EMTALA and other laws, most of which we
consider to be technical violations. This obligation could
result in greater scrutiny by regulatory authorities. Breach of
the CIA could subject HCA to substantial monetary penalties
and/or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.



Conversion Legislation

Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws
affecting the conversion, or sale, of not-for-profit hospitals.
These laws, in general, include provisions relating to attorney
general approval, advance notification and community
involvement. In addition, state attorneys general in states
without specific conversion legislation may exercise authority
over these transactions based upon existing law. In many states
there has been an increased interest in the oversight of
not-for-profit conversions. The adoption of conversion
legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital
conversions may limit HCA’s ability to grow through
acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.

Revenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51

In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding
the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and
not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax rulings, the
IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the
tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit
entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat
joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to
them. HCA is continuing to review the impact of the tax rulings
on its existing joint ventures and the development of future
joint ventures, and is consulting with its joint venture
partners and tax advisers to develop appropriate courses of
action.

The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and
any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the
tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner
or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated
business taxable income could further limit joint venture
development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the
restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with
not-for-profits.

Antitrust Laws

The Federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
competition. Violations of Federal or state antitrust laws can
result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. HCA
believes it is in compliance with such Federal and state laws,
but there can be no assurance that a review of HCA’s
practices by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in
a determination that could adversely affect HCA’s
operations.

Environmental Matters

HCA is subject to various Federal, state and local statutes and
ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment. Management does not believe that HCA will be
required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with
these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially
affect its capital expenditures, results of operations or
financial condition.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, HCA is subject to
claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
business. Through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, HCA
insures a substantial portion of its professional liability
risks. HCA’s facilities are insured by the insurance
subsidiary for losses of up to $25 million per occurrence.
HCA also maintains professional liability insurance with
unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts
insured by its insurance subsidiary. HCA and its insurance
subsidiary maintain reserves for professional liability risks
that totaled $1.593 billion at December 31, 2004.
Management considers such reserves, which are based on
actuarially determined estimates, to be adequate for such
liability risks. HCA maintains its directors and officers,
property and other typical coverages with unrelated commercial
carriers.



Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2004, HCA had approximately
191,400 employees, including approximately
53,500 part-time employees. References herein to
“employees” refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.
HCA is subject to various state and Federal laws that regulate
wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating
to employment. Employees at 16 hospitals are represented by
various labor unions. HCA considers its employee relations to be
satisfactory. HCA’s hospitals are experiencing some union
organizational activity, and HCA anticipates that it will have
elections at two hospitals in Nevada in the first quarter of
2005. However, the Company does not expect such efforts to
materially affect its future operations. HCA’s hospitals,
like most hospitals, have experienced labor costs rising faster
than the general inflation rate. In some markets, nurse and
medical support personnel availability has become a significant
operating issue to health care providers. To address this
challenge, HCA has implemented several initiatives to improve
retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.
This shortage may also require an increase in the utilization of
more expensive temporary personnel.

Licensed physicians, who have been accepted to the medical staff
of individual hospitals, staff HCA’s hospitals. With
certain exceptions, physicians generally are not employees of
HCA’s hospitals. However, some physicians provide services
in HCA’s hospitals under contracts which generally describe
a term of service, provide and establish the duties and
obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of
certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such
services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the
medical staff of any of HCA’s hospitals, but the
hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
board of the hospital, in accordance with established
credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff.
Members of the medical staffs of HCA’s hospitals often also
serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate
their affiliation with a hospital at any time.

Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risks were to
occur, HCA’s business, financial position, results of
operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known, or currently deemed immaterial by HCA, may also
constrain its business and operations. In either case, the
trading price of HCA’s common stock could decline and
stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.

HCA Has Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations,
    Claims And Litigation That Have Resulted In Significant Charges
    And Ongoing Reporting Obligations.

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to its
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
HCA entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG. If HCA was
found to be in violation of the CIA, HCA could be subject to
substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or
exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Any such sanctions or expenses could have a material
adverse effect on HCA’s financial position, results of
operations and liquidity.

If HCA Fails To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government
    Regulations, It Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make
    Significant Changes To Its Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
and complex laws and regulations at the Federal, state and local
government levels relating to, among other things:



Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark
Law. These laws impact the relationships that HCA may have with
physicians and other referral sources. HCA has a variety of
financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to
its hospitals, including employment contracts, leases and
professional service agreements. HCA also provides financial
incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit
physicians into the communities served by its hospitals. The OIG
has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that
are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
Statute. A number of HCA’s current financial relationships
with physicians and other referral sources do not qualify for
safe harbor protection under the Anti-kickback Statute. While
the Company endeavors to comply with the applicable safe
harbors, certain of the Company’s current arrangements,
including joint ventures, do not qualify for safe harbor
protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the
arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute, but
may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. HCA cannot
assure that practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not
be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute.

HCA’s financial relationships with physicians and their
immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by
meeting an exception. HCA attempts to structure its
relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the
regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and
complex, and HCA cannot assure that every relationship complies
fully with the Stark Law.

If HCA fails to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
Law or other applicable laws and regulations, it could be
subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil
penalties (including the loss of its licenses to operate one or
more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from
participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal and
state health care programs. See Item 1,
“Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

Because many of these laws and regulations are relatively new,
HCA does not always have the benefit of significant regulatory
or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the
future, different interpretations or enforcement of these laws
and regulations could subject HCA’s current or past
practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could
require HCA to make changes in its facilities, equipment,
personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating
expenses. A determination that HCA has violated these laws, or
the public announcement that it is being investigated for
possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse
effect on its business, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects and HCA’s business reputation could
suffer significantly. In addition, HCA is unable to predict
whether other legislation or regulations at the Federal or state
level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations
may take or their impact.

HCA Is Subject To Uncertainties Regarding Health Care
    Reform.

In recent years, an increasing number of legislative initiatives
have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in state
legislatures that would result in major changes in the health
care system, either nationally or at the state level. Among the
proposals that have been introduced are price controls on
hospitals, insurance market reforms to increase the availability
of group health insurance to small businesses, requirements that
all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their
employees and the creation of a government health insurance plan
or plans that would cover all citizens and increase payments by
beneficiaries. HCA cannot predict whether any of the above
proposals, or any other proposals, will be adopted,



and if adopted, no assurance can be given that the
implementation of such reforms will not have a material adverse
effect on HCA’s business, financial position or results of
operations.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other
    Hospitals And Health Care Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive and competition
among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
local communities served by most of HCA’s hospitals provide
services similar to those offered by HCA’s hospitals. In
addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals and
surgery and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic
areas in which HCA operates has increased significantly. As a
result, most of HCA’s hospitals operate in an increasingly
competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that compete with
HCA’s hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or
not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments and
charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures
and operations on a tax-exempt basis. HCA is facing increasing
competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and
freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin
services and for quality physicians and personnel. If HCA’s
competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit
physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care
contracts at their facilities, HCA may experience a decline in
patient volume. See Item 1, “Business —
Competition.”

Section 507 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement
and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provided for an
18-month moratorium on the establishment of new specialty
hospitals. Congress also required that MedPAC and HHS conduct
studies on specialty hospitals with reports to be completed no
later than 15 months after the date of enactment of MMA. In
January 2005, MedPAC adopted a recommendation that Congress
extend the moratorium for an additional 18 months. HHS has
not yet issued a report of its analysis of specialty hospitals
or issued recommendations. Congress or CMS could adopt potential
modifications that could make significant changes to the
Medicare DRG payment system, such as severity adjusted DRGs, DRG
weights, and outliers. It is uncertain as to what, if any,
action that Congress or CMS will take as a result of these
studies.

HCA’s Performance Depends On Its Ability To Recruit And
    Retain Quality Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions
and, therefore, the success of HCA’s hospitals depends, in
part, on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical
staffs of its hospitals, the admitting practices of those
physicians and maintaining good relations with those physicians.
Physicians are generally not employees of the hospitals at which
they practice and, in many of the markets that HCA serves, most
physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in
addition to HCA’s hospitals. Such physicians may terminate
their affiliation with HCA hospitals at any time. If HCA is
unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically
advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs
of those physicians, they may be discouraged from referring
patients to HCA facilities, admissions may decrease and
HCA’s operating performance may decline.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May
    Increase Its Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.

HCA’s operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities
and experience of its management and medical support personnel,
such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as its
physicians. HCA competes with other health care providers in
recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of its
hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
other medical support personnel has become a significant
operating issue to health care providers. This shortage may
require HCA to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit
and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire
more expensive temporary personnel. HCA also depends on the
available labor pool of semiskilled and unskilled employees in
each of the markets in which it operates. If HCA’s labor
costs increase, it may not be able to raise rates to offset
these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of
HCA’s revenues consist of fixed, prospective payments, its
ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained.
HCA’s failure to recruit and retain



qualified management, nurses and other medical support
personnel, or to control its labor costs could have a material
adverse effect on HCA’s results of operations.

Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce HCA’s
    Revenues.

A significant portion of HCA’s patient volumes are derived
from government health care programs, principally Medicare and
Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and
substantial changes. HCA derived approximately 53% of its
admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2004. In
recent years, legislative changes have resulted in limitations
on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to
health care providers for certain services under these
government programs.

A number of states are experiencing budget problems and have
adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce
their Medicaid expenditures. States have also adopted, or are
considering, legislation designed to provide universal coverage
and additional care. Such legislation includes reducing coverage
and program eligibility, enrolling Medicaid recipients in
managed care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals
to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems.
Hospital operating margins have been, and may continue to be,
under significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing
flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in
excess of the increase in PPS payments under the Medicare
program. Future legislation or other changes in the
administration or interpretation of government health programs
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operations of HCA.

Demands Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely Affect
    HCA’s Growth In Revenues.

HCA’s ability to negotiate favorable contracts with
nongovernment payers, including managed care plans,
significantly affects the revenues and operating results of most
of its hospitals. Admissions derived from managed care and other
discounted plans accounted for approximately 42% of HCA’s
admissions in 2004. Nongovernment payers, including managed care
payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures.
Reductions in price increases or the amounts received from
managed care, commercial insurance or other payers could have a
material adverse effect on the financial position and results of
operations of HCA.

The Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A
    Deterioration In The Collectability Of These Accounts Could
    Adversely Affect HCA’s Results Of Operations.

The primary collection risks of the Company’s accounts
receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient
accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the
amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient
responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain
outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates
primarily to amounts due directly from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts represented approximately 78% of the
$3.762 billion patient due accounts receivable balance,
including accounts related to patients for which eligibility for
Medicaid coverage was being evaluated (“pending Medicaid
accounts”). The Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts represented approximately 90% of the
$3.254 billion patient due accounts receivable balance,
excluding pending Medicaid accounts. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, the provision for doubtful accounts
increased to 11.4% of revenues compared to 10.1% of revenues in
2003.

On December 29, 2004, CMS issued guidance that has enabled
hospitals to provide discounts to any uninsured patient without
placing the hospital’s Medicare payments at risk. Based on
this guidance, HCA implemented modifications to its self-pay
policies effective January 1, 2005, the effect of which is
to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do not qualify
for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
those provided to many local managed care plans. In implementing
the discount policy, hospitals will first attempt to qualify
uninsured patients for Medicaid, other Federal or state
assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount will be
applied.



A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
accounts and a deterioration in the collectability of these
accounts will adversely affect HCA’s collection of accounts
receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce
    HCA’s Revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payers designed to reduce
admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
“utilization review,” have affected and are expected
to continue to affect HCA’s facilities. Utilization review
entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a
patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average
lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively
affected by payer-required preadmission authorization and
utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient
and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely
ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are
expected to continue. Although HCA is unable to predict the
effect these changes will have on its operations, significant
limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement
rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s business, financial position and results of
operations.

HCA’s Shared Services And Other Initiatives May Not
    Achieve Anticipated Efficiencies.

HCA implemented shared services initiatives designed to increase
revenue, accelerate cash flows and reduce operating costs by
consolidating hospitals’ back-office functions such as
billing, collections and purchasing. HCA has developed ten
regional patient account services (“PAS”) centers
located in the Company’s major regional markets. The PASs
provide the business office services that were previously
performed in each facility and are intended to provide a setting
to better utilize experienced personnel, share best practices
and handle volumes of transactions more efficiently through
stratification and specialization. HCA has implemented supply
improvement and distribution programs that include consolidating
purchasing functions regionally, combining warehouses and
developing division-based procurement programs. HCA has expended
significant sums to build and implement these shared services
initiatives. There can be no assurance that HCA will be able to
realize the anticipated efficiencies from these initiatives.

During the second quarter of 2003, HCA announced plans to
discontinue activities associated with the development of a
patient accounting software system resulting in a pretax charge
of $130 million. HCA had estimated that the patient
accounting project would have required total expenditures of
approximately $400 million to develop and install. HCA is
in the process of implementing projects to replace its payroll
and human resources information systems. Management estimates
that the payroll and human resources system projects will
require total expenditures of approximately $330 million to
develop and install. At December 31, 2004, project-to-date
costs incurred were $245 million ($151 million of the
costs incurred have been capitalized and $94 million have
been expensed). Management expects that the system development,
testing, data conversion and installation will continue through
2006. There can be no assurance that the development and
implementation of those systems will not be delayed, that the
total cost will not be significantly more than currently
anticipated, that business processes will not be interrupted
during implementation or that HCA will realize the expected
benefits and efficiencies from the developed products.

HCA’s Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of The
    Company’s Information Systems.

The performance of HCA’s sophisticated information
technology and systems is critical to HCA’s business
operations. In addition to HCA’s shared services
initiatives, HCA’s information systems are essential to a
number of critical areas of the Company’s business
operations, including:



•

inventory management; and

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
availability of HCA’s systems could adversely affect
operations or delay the collection of revenue. Even though HCA
has implemented network security measures, the Company’s
servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and
similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence
of any of these events could result in interruptions, delays,
the loss or corruption of data, or cessations in the
availability of systems, all of which could have a material
adverse effect on the financial position and results of
operations and harm HCA’s business reputation.

State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of
    Hospitals Could Impair HCA’s Ability To Operate And Expand
    Its Operations.

Some states require health care providers to obtain prior
approval, known as a certificate of need or CON, for the
purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities,
to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in
services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states
consider the need for additional or expanded health care
facilities or services. HCA currently operates hospitals in a
number of states with CON laws. The failure to obtain any
requested CON could impair HCA’s ability to operate or
expand operations.

HCA’s Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And
    Texas, Which Makes The Company Sensitive To Regulatory,
    Economic, Environmental And Competitive Changes In Those
    States.

HCA operated 189 hospitals at December 31, 2004, and
76 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. This
situation makes HCA particularly sensitive to regulatory,
economic, environmental and competition changes in those states.

Any material change in the current payment programs or
regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in
those states could have a disproportionate effect on the
Company’s overall business results.

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.

HCA is currently contesting claims for income taxes and related
interest proposed by the IRS for prior years aggregating
approximately $404 million through December 31, 2004.
The disputed items include the timing of recognition of certain
patient service revenues in 2000, the amount of insurance
expense deducted in 1999 and 2000, and the amount of gain or
loss recognized on the divestiture of certain business units in
1998. During 2004, the IRS began an examination of HCA’s
2001 through 2002 Federal income tax returns. The IRS has not
determined the amount of any additional income tax and interest
that the IRS may claim upon completion of this examination or
any future examinations that may be initiated by the IRS. See
Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — IRS
Disputes.”

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against
    Its Facilities.

HCA is subject to litigation relating to its business practices,
including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims
and significant defense costs. HCA insures a substantial portion
of its professional liability risks through a wholly-owned
subsidiary. Management believes HCA’s insurance coverage is
sufficient to cover claims arising out of the operation of
HCA’s facilities. HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary historically has entered into certain reinsurance
contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance
contracts remain on the balance sheet as the subsidiary remains
liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their
obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for
claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered
by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their
obligations, the results of operations and financial position of
HCA could be adversely affected.



Fluctuations In Operating Results And Other Factors May
    Result In Decreases In HCA’s Stock Price.

The stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has
often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular
companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect
the trading price of HCA’s common stock. There may be
significant volatility in the market price of HCA’s common
stock. If HCA is unable to operate its hospitals as profitably
as it has in the past, investors could sell shares of HCA’s
common stock when it becomes apparent that the expectations of
the market may not be realized, resulting in a decrease in the
market price of HCA’s common stock.

In addition to HCA’s operating results, the operating
results of other hospital companies, changes in financial
estimates or recommendations by analysts, changes in government
health care programs, governmental investigations and
litigation, speculation in the press or investment community,
the possible effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities,
adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses,
changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial
markets, or other developments affecting the health care
industry, could cause the market price of HCA’s common
stock to fluctuate substantially.

HCA Has Increased Leverage As A Result Of Financing Its
    Recently Completed “Dutch” Auction Tender Offer.

In October 2004, HCA announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.501 billion of its common stock. To finance the tender
offer, HCA used approximately $1.25 billion under the
revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) and
term loan facility available to it pursuant to its Credit
Agreement dated November 9, 2004 with certain lenders,
issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of
5.500% Notes due 2009, and issued $750 million
aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Notes due 2015.
HCA’s total long-term debt, including amounts due within
one year, increased from $8.707 billion at
December 31, 2003 to $10.530 billion at
December 31, 2004. See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and
“— Market Risk” and Note 10 —
Long-Term Debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements
for additional information on HCA’s debt obligations.

HCA may continue to make borrowings under the Credit Facility,
and in December 2004, filed a shelf registration statement with
the Securities and Exchange Commission which will allow the
Company to issue, from time to time, up to $1.5 billion in
additional debt securities. HCA’s ability to make payments
on its debt and to fund planned capital expenditures and the
operation of its business will depend on its cash flow from
operations, amounts available under the Credit Facility and
HCA’s access to public and private debt markets. HCA’s
increased debt service obligations could, among other things:

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number of hospitals
(general, acute care, psychiatric and rehabilitation) directly
or indirectly owned and operated by the Company as of
December 31, 2004:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, HCA
directly or indirectly operates 92 freestanding surgery centers.
HCA also operates medical office buildings in conjunction with
some of its hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
occupied by physicians who practice at HCA’s hospitals.

HCA maintains its headquarters in approximately
906,000 square feet of space in six office buildings in
Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to the headquarters in
Nashville, HCA maintains service centers related to the
Company’s shared services initiatives. These service
centers are located in markets in which the Company operates
hospitals.

HCA’s headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
for HCA’s present needs. HCA’s properties are subject
to various Federal, state and local statutes and ordinances
regulating their operation. Management does not believe that
compliance with such statutes and ordinances will materially
affect HCA’s financial position or results of operations.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
asserted against the Company. The resolution of any such
lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could
materially, adversely affect HCA’s results of operations
and financial position in a given period.

Government Investigation, Claims and Litigation

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to its
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

If HCA were found to be in violation of Federal or state laws
relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or breach of
the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary fines,
civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from participation
in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such sanctions or
expenses could have a material adverse effect on HCA’s
financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

General Liability and Other Claims

The Company is a party to certain proceedings relating to claims
for income taxes and related interest in the United States Tax
Court, the United States Court of Federal Claims and the United
States Supreme Court. For a description of those proceedings,
see Note 6 — Income Taxes in the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to claims and suits arising in the
ordinary course of business, including claims for personal
injuries or for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
the claimants have asked for punitive damages against the
Company, which may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion
of management, the ultimate resolution of these pending claims
and legal proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect
on the Company’s results of operations or financial
position.

HCA’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the “NYSE”) (symbol “HCA”).
The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated,
the high and low sales prices per share reported on the NYSE
composite tape for HCA’s common stock.

At the close of business on February 28, 2005, there were
approximately 14,100 holders of record of HCA’s common

In January 2004, HCA’s Board of Directors approved an
increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.02 per share to
$0.13 per share. The Board declared the initial
$0.13 per share dividend payable on June 1, 2004 to
shareholders of record at May 1, 2004. In January 2005,
HCA’s Board of Directors approved an increase in its
quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.15 per
share. The Board declared the initial $0.15 per share
dividend payable on June 1, 2005 to shareholders of record
at May 1, 2005. The declaration and payment of future
dividends by HCA will depend upon many factors, including
HCA’s earnings, financial position, business needs, capital
and surplus and regulatory considerations.

2004 Operations Summary

Net income totaled $1.246 billion, or $2.58 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to $1.332 billion, or $2.61 per diluted
share, for the year ended December 31, 2003. The 2004
results include a favorable change in HCA’s estimated
provision for doubtful accounts totaling approximately

2004 Operations Summary (Continued)

$46 million, pretax, or $0.06 per diluted share, based
upon refinements to its allowance for doubtful accounts
estimation process related to estimated recoveries associated
with Medicare copays and deductibles and collection agency
placements. A $59 million reduction, or $0.07 per
diluted share, to the Company’s estimated professional
liability insurance reserves also impacted the 2004 results.
This positive change was determined based upon the semiannual,
independent actuarial analyses which noted favorable claim and
payment trends, the adoption of tort reform and limitations on
losses in certain states and low inflation rates. HCA believes
the favorable claim and payment trends are, in part, the result
of the Company’s patient safety programs. Two negative
impacts on 2004 results include an estimated adverse financial
impact from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan and Jeanne of
$40 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, and an asset
impairment charge of $12 million, or $0.02 per diluted
share, associated with the closure of San Jose Medical
Center, in San Jose, California. HCA repurchased
62.9 million shares of its common stock during the fourth
quarter of 2004. HCA’s shares used for diluted earnings per
share for the year ended December 31, 2004 were
483.7 million shares, compared to 510.9 million shares
for the year ended December 31, 2003.

Revenues rose 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2004,
revenue per equivalent admission increased 5.5%, admissions
increased 1.5% and equivalent admissions increased 2.2% compared
to the year ended December 31, 2003. While revenue per
equivalent admission increased 5.5%, salaries per equivalent
admission increased 6.2% and supplies per equivalent admission
increased 8.5%.

The Company’s provision for doubtful accounts increased to
$2.669 billion, or 11.4% of revenues, for the year ended
December 31, 2004, compared to $2.207 billion, or
10.1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2003 due
to continued trends associated with growth of uninsured accounts
and a deterioration in the collectability of these accounts.

While the Company has faced both operational and investigation
related challenges during the past three years, management
believes that it is important to recognize that HCA has
generated cash provided by operating activities of
$3.049 billion, $2.166 billion and $2.750 billion
during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain Government Claims

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to its
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003.

In January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate
Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of
Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
Services. If HCA were found to be in violation of Federal or
state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or
breach of the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such
sanctions or expenses could have a material, adverse effect on
HCA’s financial position, results of operation and
liquidity.

Business Strategy

HCA is committed to providing the communities it serves high
quality, cost-effective, health care while maintaining
consistency with HCA’s ethics and compliance program,
governmental regulations and guidelines, and industry standards.
As a part of this strategy, HCA’s management focuses on the
following areas:

•

Commitment to the care and improvement of human life:

The
    foundation of HCA is built on putting patients first and
    providing quality health care services in the communities it
    serves. HCA continues to

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of HCA’s consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses. HCA’s management base their
estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances.
Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes
changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience
develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

Management believes that the following critical accounting
policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates
used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the
Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to
interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on
a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best
information available regarding



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)

Revenues     (Continued)

management’s interpretation of the applicable laws,
regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews
the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate
updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in
managed care contractual terms that result from contract
renegotiations and renewals. Management has invested significant
resources to refine and improve its computerized billing system
and the information system data used to make contractual
allowance estimates. Management has developed standardized
calculation processes and related training programs to improve
the utility of the patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering
from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a
facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state
laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA, and
HCA’s commitment to providing quality patient care
encourages the Company to provide services to patients who are
financially unable to pay for the health care services they
receive.

HCA does not pursue collection of amounts related to patients
that meet the Company’s guidelines to qualify as charity
care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. The revenues
associated with uninsured patients that do not meet the
Company’s guidelines to qualify as charity care have
generally been reported in revenues at gross charges. During
2003, the Company announced that patients treated at an HCA
wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care, who have income at
or below 200% of the Federal poverty level, are eligible for
charity care, a standard HCA estimates that 70% of its
affiliated hospitals were previously using. The Federal poverty
level is established by the Federal government and is based on
income and family size. On January 1, 2005, HCA modified
its policies to provide discounts to uninsured patients who do
not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
implementing the discount policy, HCA will first attempt to
qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other Federal or state
assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount will be
applied. HCA expects that this new policy will lower revenues
and the provision for doubtful accounts by generally
corresponding amounts.

Due to the complexities involved in these estimations of
revenues earned, the health care services authorized and
provided and related reimbursement are often subject to
interpretations that could result in payments that are different
from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% change in receivables that
are net of contractual discounts at December 31, 2004,
would result in an impact on pretax earnings of approximately
$23 million.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
care payers, other third-party payers and patients is HCA’s
primary source of cash and is critical to the Company’s
operating performance. The primary collection risks relate to
the uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for
which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered
by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
(deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all
uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)

Provision for Doubtful Accounts
and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (Continued)

accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal
and external collection efforts have been performed. HCA
considers the return of an account from the primary external
collection agency to be the culmination of its reasonable
collection efforts and the timing basis for writing off the
account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific
identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff
adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Because HCA
does not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that
meet the Company’s guidelines to qualify as charity care,
they are not reported in revenues and do not have an impact on
the provision for doubtful accounts. On January 1, 2005,
HCA began providing a discount to uninsured patients who do not
qualify for Medicaid or charity care. HCA expects that this new
policy will lower revenues and the provision for doubtful
accounts by generally, corresponding amounts.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management
relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical
writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of HCA’s revenues and accounts receivable (the
“hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of
information in estimating the collectability of HCA’s
accounts receivable. Prior to the third quarter of 2003, the
Company performed the hindsight analysis on an annual basis. The
results of the annual hindsight analysis that was completed
during the second quarter of 2003 indicated an increasing
proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
accounts and the collectability of this category of accounts had
deteriorated. Beginning with the third quarter of 2003, HCA
began performing a quarterly, rolling twelve-month hindsight
analysis to enable a more timely reaction to trends affecting
the collectability of the accounts receivable. The provision for
doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2004
includes a favorable change in the estimated provision totaling
approximately $46 million, pretax or $0.06 per diluted
share, based upon refinements to the allowance for doubtful
accounts estimation process related to estimated recoveries
associated with Medicare copayments and deductibles and
collection agency placements. At December 31, 2004, the
Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts represented
approximately 78% of the $3.762 billion patient due
accounts receivable balance, including accounts related to
patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being
evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). The
Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts represented
approximately 90% of the $3.254 billion patient due
accounts receivable balance, excluding pending Medicaid
accounts. Revenue days in accounts receivable were 48 days,
52 days and 52 days at December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts
increased to 11.4% of revenues for 2004, from 10.1% of revenues
for 2003 and from 8.0% of revenues in 2002. Management expects a
continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the
patient due accounts. Adverse changes in general economic
conditions, business office operations, payer mix, or trends in
Federal or state governmental and private employer health care
coverage could affect HCA’s collection of accounts
receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payor
classification as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 is set
forth in the following table:

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary —
    Other-than-temporary Impairment Considerations

HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary holds debt and
equity security investments having an aggregate fair value of
$2.322 billion at December 31, 2004. The fair value of
the investment securities is generally based on quoted market
prices. The investment securities are held for the purpose of
providing the funding source to pay professional liability
claims covered by the insurance subsidiary. Management’s
assessment each quarter of whether a decline in fair value is
temporary or other-than-temporary involves multiple subjective
judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future
events, and requires a significant level of professional
judgment in determining whether factors exist that indicate an
impairment has occurred. HCA evaluates, among other things, the
financial position and near term prospects of the issuer,
conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the
investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected future
cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the
issuer by a rating agency to determine if, and when, a decline
in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is
considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment
to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s
fair value are important components of management’s
investment securities evaluation process. During 2002, HCA
recognized a $168 million other-than-temporary impairment
charge related, primarily, to the insurance subsidiary’s
equity investment securities. There were no other-than-temporary
declines in fair value during 2003 and 2004 and at
December 31, 2004, the insurance subsidiary’s
investment security portfolio had unrealized gains of
$233 million and unrealized losses of $2 million.

Professional Liability Claims

HCA, along with virtually all health care providers, operates in
an environment with professional liability risks. A substantial
portion of HCA’s professional liability risks is insured
through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves for
professional liability risks were $1.593 billion and
$1.624 billion at December 31, 2004 and
December 31, 2003, respectively. The current portion of
these reserves, $310 million at both Decem-

Professional Liability
Claims (Continued)

ber 31, 2004 and 2003, is included in “other accrued
expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance contracts
remain on the balance sheet as the insurance subsidiary remains
liable to the extent that reinsurers do not meet their
obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of
$79 million and $147 million receivable under
reinsurance contracts at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively) were $1.514 billion and $1.477 billion
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Reserves and
provisions for professional liability risks are based upon
actuarially determined estimates. The independent
actuaries’ estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts
receivable under reinsurance contracts, were $1.296 billion
to $1.530 billion at December 31, 2004 and
$1.255 billion to $1.515 billion at December 31,
2003. Reserves for professional liability risks represent the
estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses
incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet
dates. The reserves are estimated using individual case-basis
valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject
to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The
estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded
as experience develops or new information becomes known.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
approximately 3,500 and 3,900 individual claims at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and estimates for
potential unreported claims. The time period required to resolve
these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated. The estimation of the
timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Changes
to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current
operating results. Due to the considerable variability that is
inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that the
ultimate liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks
were $291 million, $380 million and $315 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The provision for losses for the year ended
December 31, 2004 includes a $59 million reduction to
the Company’s estimated professional liability insurance
reserves. The amount of the change to the estimated professional
liability insurance reserves was determined based upon the
semiannual, independent actuarial analyses, which noted
favorable claim and payment trends, the adoption of tort reform
and limitations on losses in certain states and low inflation
rates. HCA believes the favorable claim and payment trends are,
in part, the result of the Company’s patient safety
programs.

Revenue/Volume Trends

HCA’s revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services.
HCA’s facilities’ gross charges typically do not
reflect what the facilities are actually paid. HCA’s
facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers,
including government programs and managed care health plans,
under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of
providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per
diem rates or discounts from gross charges.

Revenues increased 7.8% to $23.502 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2004 from $21.808 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2003 and increased 10.5% to
$21.808 billion for the year ended December 31, 2003
from $19.729 billion for the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase in revenues in 2004 can be primarily
attributed to a 1.3% increase in same facility equivalent
admissions and a 6.0% increase in same facility revenue per
equivalent admission compared to the prior year. For the year
ended

December 31, 2004, 89.8% of the $1.694 billion increase in
revenues, compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, was
related to the increase in same facility revenues and the
remaining 10.2% of the increase relates to acquired facilities.
The increase in revenues in 2003 can be primarily attributed to
a 7.5% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent
admission compared to 2002 and $698 million of revenues from the
eleven Kansas City hospitals that were acquired during April
2003.

Same facility admissions increased by 0.7% in 2004 compared to
2003 and increased 0.6% in 2003 compared to 2002. Same facility
inpatient surgeries increased 2.2% and same facility outpatient
surgeries increased 1.4% during 2004 compared to 2003. Same
facility inpatient surgeries decreased 0.2% and same facility
outpatient surgeries decreased 3.0% during 2003 compared to
2002. Same facility emergency room visits increased 0.2% during
2004 compared to 2003 and increased 4.2% during 2003 compared to
2002.

Admissions related to Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid,
managed care and other discounted plans and uninsured for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are set forth
below. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the 2004 presentation.

Prior to 2004, managed Medicaid admissions were classified as
    either Medicaid or managed care.

Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 7.6% and
uninsured admissions increased 9.7% during 2004 compared to
2003. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased
10.5% and uninsured admissions increased 6.9% during 2003
compared to 2002.

Management cannot predict whether the current trends in
uninsured admissions and net revenue per equivalent admission
will continue. While complying with all Federal and state laws
and regulations, including but not limited to the EMTALA, and
the Company’s commitment to providing quality patient care,
the Company has begun implementing improvements in the following
areas: treating patients in the most clinically appropriate and
cost-effective setting; collecting appropriate patient
information at the appropriate times; and improving cash
collections earlier in the patient encounter and at the point of
discharge.

At December 31, 2004, HCA owned and operated 40 hospitals
and 28 surgery centers in the state of Florida. HCA’s
Florida facilities revenues totaled $6.036 billion and
$5.545 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2004, HCA owned and
operated 36 hospitals and 19 surgery centers in the state of
Texas. HCA’s Texas facilities revenues totaled
$3.725 billion and $3.520 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

HCA recorded $124 million, $221 million, and
$284 million of revenues related to Medicare operating
outlier cases for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. These amounts represent 2.0%, 3.7% and
5.1% of Medicare revenues and 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.4% of total
revenues for the years ended

December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There can
be no assurances that HCA will continue to receive these levels
of Medicare outlier payments in future periods.

HCA provided $926 million, $821 million and
$579 million of charity care and discounts to the uninsured
during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. On January 1, 2005, HCA modified its policies
to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do not qualify
for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
those provided to many local managed care plans. In implementing
the discount policy, HCA will first attempt to qualify uninsured
patients for Medicaid, other Federal or state assistance or
charity care. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these
programs, the uninsured discount will be applied.

The approximate percentages of inpatient revenues of the
Company’s facilities related to Medicare, Medicaid, managed
Medicaid, managed care plans and other discounted plans and
uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and

Prior to 2004, managed Medicaid revenues were classified as
    either Medicaid or managed care.

HCA receives a significant portion of its revenues from
government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid,
which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and
substantial changes. Legislative changes have resulted in
limitations and even reductions in levels of payments to health
care providers for certain services under these government
programs.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Net income decreased 6.5% from $1.332 billion, or
$2.61 per diluted share, for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to $1.246 billion or $2.58 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
2004 results include a favorable change in HCA’s estimated
provision for doubtful accounts totaling approximately
$46 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, based upon
refinements to its allowance for doubtful accounts estimation
process related to estimated recoveries associated with Medicare
copayments and deductibles and collection agency placements, a
$59 million reduction, or $0.07 per diluted share, to
the Company’s estimated professional liability reserves, an
adverse financial impact from hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan
and Jeanne of $40 million, or $0.05 per diluted share,
an impairment of long-lived assets of $12 million, or
$0.02 per diluted share, and a favorable $19 million,
or $0.04 per diluted share, reduction in the effective
income tax rate. The 2003 results include a favorable settlement
with the Federal government, net of investigation related costs,
of $33 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, an asset
impairment charge of $130 million, or $0.16 per
diluted share, and gains on sales of facilities of
$85 million, or $0.10 per diluted share.

In April 2003, HCA completed the acquisition of eleven hospitals
in Kansas City. During the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively, the acquired Kansas City hospitals
produced revenues of $885 million and $698 million and
losses before income taxes of $31 million and
$35 million. The 2003 amounts include operations subsequent
to the April 1, 2003 acquisition date.

Revenues increased 7.8% to $23.5 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $21.8 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to a
2.2% increase in equivalent admissions and an increase in
revenue per equivalent admission of 5.5%. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, admissions increased 1.5% and same
facility admissions increased by 0.7% compared to 2003.
Outpatient surgical volumes increased 2.5%, and increased 1.4%
on a same facility basis.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, remained
relatively flat at 40.1% in 2004 and 39.8% in 2003.

Supply costs increased, as a percentage of revenues, to 16.6%
for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to 16.2% for
the year ended December 31, 2003. Supply costs continue to
increase, particularly in the cardiac, orthopedic and
pharmaceutical areas. Expenditures for drug-eluting stents
increased from $49 million for 2003 to $137 million
for 2004.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of contract
services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and
leases, utilities, insurance and nonincome taxes), as a
percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.0% in 2004 from 16.8% in
2003. The decrease, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily
due to reductions in the Company’s estimated provision for
losses related to professional liability risks from
$380 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to
$291 million for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Other operating expenses were adversely affected during 2004 due
to repairs and other miscellaneous expenses which resulted from
the hurricanes and are estimated to have cost the Company
$18 million, net of insurance recoveries. Other operating
expenses also tend to decrease, as a percentage of revenues,
when the Company experiences revenue increases, because the
majority of these expenses include significant fixed cost
components.

The provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of
revenues, increased to 11.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2004 from 10.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The factors influencing this increase
include increasing patient financial responsibilities and
uninsured accounts, and a deterioration in the collectability of
these accounts. HCA believes the increases in uninsured patients
and deterioration in the

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Years Ended December 31,
2004 and 2003 (Continued)

collectability of these accounts is caused by decreased medical
benefits under certain plans, an increasing amount of patient
financial responsibility under certain plans, high unemployment
levels in certain of HCA’s markets, growing numbers of
employed individuals choosing not to buy health insurance and
reductions in Medicaid benefits in certain states.

Gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2004
of $56 million consist primarily of net gains on investment
securities held by HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary.
Gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2003
were $1 million. At December 31, 2004, HCA had net
unrealized gains of $231 million on the insurance
subsidiary’s investment securities.

Equity in earnings of affiliates remained relatively flat and
were $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to $199 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Depreciation and amortization increased, as a percentage of
revenues, to 5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2004 from
5.1% in the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase of
$138 million of depreciation and amortization is the result
of $6.1 billion of capital spending, including
acquisitions, during the last three years.

Interest expense increased to $563 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004 from $491 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The average rate for the
Company’s Credit Facility increased from 1.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to 2.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2004, and the average rate for the
Company’s bank term loans increased from 2.2% for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to 2.6% for the year ended
December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, approximately
26.6% of HCA’s debt portfolio was in variable rate debt,
while at December 31, 2003, approximately 24.2% of
HCA’s debt portfolio was in variable rate debt. During 2003
interest rates were lower for variable rate debt than they were
in 2004. The average of the beginning and ending debt balances
for the Company increased from $7.825 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $9.619 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

During 2004, HCA closed San Jose Medical Center in
San Jose, California, resulting in a pretax charge of
$12 million ($8 million after-tax). During 2003, HCA
announced plans to discontinue activities associated with the
internal development of a patient accounts receivable management
system, resulting in a pretax charge of $130 million
($79 million after-tax).

During 2003, HCA recognized a pretax gain of $85 million
($49 million after-tax) on the sales of two leased
hospitals and two consolidating hospitals, and a working capital
settlement related to a sale completed in 2002.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
increased to $168 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $150 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 due to improved operations
during 2004 at HCA’s joint ventures.

The effective income tax rate was 36.8% in 2004 and 38.2% in
2003. The Company’s effective tax rate was adjusted to
reduce estimated state taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004,
resulting in a tax expense reduction of $19 million, or
$0.04 per diluted share.

Years Ended December 31, 2003 and 2002

Net income totaled $1.332 billion, or $2.61 per
diluted share, in 2003 compared to $833 million, or
$1.59 per diluted share, in 2002. The operating results for
2003 include a favorable change in estimate related

to Medicaid cost report balances for cost report years ended
1997, and prior, net of investigation related costs, of
$33 million pretax, or $0.04 per diluted share, gains
on sales of facilities of $85 million pretax, or
$0.10 per diluted share, and an impairment of long-lived
assets of $130 million pretax, or $0.16 per diluted
share. The operating results for 2002 include a
$661 million pretax charge, or $0.87 per diluted
share, related to the settlement with government agencies and
investigation related costs, gains on the sales of facilities of
$6 million pretax, or $0.01 per diluted share, a
$168 million pretax charge, or $0.20 per diluted
share, on the impairment of investment securities, and an
impairment of long-lived assets of $19 million pretax, or
$0.03 per diluted share.

In April 2003, HCA completed the acquisition of eleven hospitals
in Kansas City. During 2003, the acquired Kansas City hospitals
produced revenues of $698 million and losses before income
taxes of $35 million. The Kansas City hospitals are
included in the Company’s Western Group. The 2003 amounts
include operations subsequent to the April 1, 2003
acquisition date.

For 2003, admissions increased 3.3% and same facility admissions
increased by 0.6% compared to 2002. Outpatient surgical volumes
increased 0.5%, but decreased 3.0% on a same facility basis. The
weaker than expected volumes were the result of general economic
conditions and increasing unemployment levels in certain
markets. Additionally, in certain markets, physician issues
related to physicians retiring or relocating due to rising
physician malpractice insurance rates, managed care contract
disputes and new competition, both in the inpatient and
outpatient lines of business, contributed to a slower rate of
volume growth.

Revenues for 2003 increased 10.5% compared to 2002. The 10.5%
increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the 7.6%
increase in same facility revenues and the $698 million of
revenues related to the acquired Kansas City hospitals. The 7.6%
increase in same facility revenues is primarily attributable to
rate increases, as same facility equivalent admissions remained
flat in 2003.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to
39.8% in 2003 from 40.3% in 2002. Excluding the acquired Kansas
City hospitals, salaries and benefits, as a percentage of
revenues, were 39.6% for 2003. The decreases reflect
improvements in the utilization of contract labor. Contract
labor per equivalent admission decreased 26.3% for 2003 compared
to 2002.

Supply costs increased, as a percentage of revenues, to 16.2%
for 2003 compared to 16.0% for 2002 due to rising supply costs,
particularly in the cardiac, orthopedic and pharmaceutical areas.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of contract
services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and
leases, utilities, insurance and nonincome taxes), as a
percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.8% in 2003 from 16.9% in
2002. Excluding the acquired Kansas City hospitals, other
operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues decreased to
16.5% for 2003.

The provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of
revenues, increased to 10.1% in 2003 from 8.0% in 2002. The
factors influencing this increase include the Company’s
recent experience of increasing patient due or uninsured
accounts and a continued deterioration associated with the
collectability of these accounts. The soft economic environment
in many of the Company’s markets, combined with increasing
copayments and deductibles, are placing an increasing financial
responsibility on the patient. The provision for doubtful
accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients.

Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased from
$206 million in 2002 to $199 million in 2003. The
decrease was due to a decline in operating results at a hospital
joint venture in California.

2003 and 2002 (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization remained relatively flat, as a
percentage of revenues, at 5.1% in 2003 compared to 5.0% in 2002.

Interest expense increased to $491 million in 2003 from
$446 million in 2002. The increase in interest expense was
due to higher levels of debt in 2003 compared to 2002. Interest
rates on the Company’s debt were lower in 2003 than in
2002. HCA’s ratio of current and long-term debt to current
and long-term debt and common and minority equity was 55.8% at
December 31, 2003 compared to 52.4% at December 31,
2002.

During 2003, HCA recognized pretax gains on sales of facilities
of $85 million ($49 million after-tax), primarily on
the sale of two leased hospitals. During 2002, HCA recognized
pretax gains on sales of facilities of $6 million
($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two consolidating
hospitals.

During 2002, due to the continued overall market decline and
management’s review and evaluation of the individual
investment securities, management concluded that certain
unrealized losses on HCA’s equity investments should be
classified as “other-than-temporary” and recorded a
pretax impairment charge on investment securities of
$168 million ($107 million after-tax).

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue activities
associated with the internal development of a patient accounts
receivable management system, resulting in a pretax charge of
$130 million ($79 million after-tax). During 2002, HCA
management decided to delay the development and implementation
of certain financial and procurement information systems,
resulting in a pretax charge of $19 million.

During 2003 and 2002, respectively, HCA incurred
$33 million of favorable and $661 million of
unfavorable government settlement and investigation related
costs. In 2003 and 2002, respectively, HCA incurred government
settlements of $41 million favorable and $603 million
unfavorable. The governmental investigations of the
Company’s business practices were concluded during 2003.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
increased to $150 million for 2003 from $148 million
for 2002.

The effective income tax rate was 38.2% in 2003 and 42.7% in
2002. The higher effective income tax rate in 2002 was due to
the recording of a valuation allowance in 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$3.049 billion in 2004 compared to $2.166 billion in
2003 and $2.750 billion in 2002. Working capital totaled
$1.509 billion at December 31, 2004 and
$1.654 million at December 31, 2003. The lower cash
flow from operations in 2003 when compared to both 2004 and 2002
relates, primarily, to the Company making government settlement
payments of $942 million in 2003.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.688 billion,
$2.862 billion and $1.740 billion in 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
were $1.513 billion in 2004, $1.838 billion in 2003
and $1.718 billion in 2002. HCA expended $44 million,
$908 million and $124 million for acquisitions and
investments in and advances to affiliates during 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively. During April 2003, HCA completed the
acquisition of the Health Midwest system in Kansas City. The
aggregate cash paid by HCA at closing was $855 million.
During 2004 and 2002, the cash used in investing activities was
generally for interests in joint ventures that are accounted for
using the equity method. Capital expenditures in all three years
were funded by a combination of cash flows from operations and
the issuance of debt. Annual planned capital expenditures are
expected to approximate $1.6 billion in both 2005 and 2006.
At December 31, 2004,



HCA INC.

there were projects under construction, which had an estimated
additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years
of $2.2 billion. HCA expects to finance capital
expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

Cash flows used in financing activities totaled
$1.347 million in 2004 and $934 million in 2002,
compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$650 million in 2003. During 2004 and 2003, HCA accessed
the Credit Facility and the public debt market to raise capital.
The primary source of funds for the cash used in financing
activities was cash flow from operating activities. During 2004,
HCA repurchased 77.4 million shares of its common stock for
$3.109 billion. During the second quarter of 2004, HCA
increased its quarterly dividend payment from $0.02 per share to
$0.13 per share. In January 2005, HCA’s Board of Directors
approved another increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.13
per share to $0.15 per share. The Board declared the initial
$0.15 per share dividend payable in the second quarter of 2005.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
capital include amounts available under HCA’s
$1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) ($992 million and $1.378 billion as of
December 31, 2004 and February 28, 2005, respectively)
and anticipated access to public and private debt markets.

Investments of HCA’s professional liability insurance
subsidiary, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
$2.322 billion and $2.065 billion at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance
recoveries, during the next twelve months are expected to
approximate $275 million. HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and
the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts remain on
the balance sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
reinsurance contracts. To minimize its exposure to losses from
reinsurer insolvencies, HCA evaluates the financial condition of
its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk
arising from similar activities or economic characteristics of
the reinsurers. The amounts receivable related to the
reinsurance contracts were $79 million and
$147 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Share Repurchase Activities

In October 2004, HCA announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.501 billion of its common stock. In November 2004, HCA
closed the tender offer to repurchase 62 million
shares of the Company’s common stock for
$2.466 billion ($39.75 per share). The shares
repurchased represented approximately 13% of the Company’s
outstanding shares at the time of the tender offer. HCA also
repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock for
$35 million through open market purchases which completed
this $2.501 billion share repurchase authorization.

In April 2003, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase
$1.5 billion of its common stock through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2003, HCA
repurchased under this authorization 25.3 million shares of
its common stock for $900 million, through open market
purchases. During 2004, HCA repurchased 14.5 million shares
of its common stock for $600 million, through open market
purchases, which completed this authorization.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase up to
12 million shares of its common stock. During 2002, HCA
made open market purchases of 6.2 million shares for
$282 million. During 2003, HCA purchased 5.8 million
shares for $214 million, through open market purchases
which completed the repurchases under this authorization. The
repurchases were intended to offset the dilutive effect of
employee stock benefit plans.

Share Repurchase Activities (Continued)

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a financial
institution that resulted in the financial institution investing
$400 million (at December 31, 2001) to capitalize an
entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This consolidated
affiliate acquired 16.8 million shares of HCA common stock
in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain forward
purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the financial
institution and received the 16.8 million shares of the
Company’s common stock.

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the share repurchase transactions
reduced stockholders’ equity by $3.109 billion,
$1.114 billion and $282 million, respectively.

Financing Activities

HCA’s revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) is a $1.75 billion agreement expiring
November 2009. Interest under the Credit Facility is payable at
either a spread to LIBOR, a spread to the prime lending rate or
a competitive bid rate. The spread is dependent on HCA’s
credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants
which include (i) limitations on debt levels,
(ii) limitations on sales of assets, mergers and changes of
ownership, and (iii) maintenance of minimum interest
coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2004, HCA was in
compliance with all such covenants.

During March 2004, HCA issued $500 million of
5.75% notes due March 15, 2014. The proceeds from the
issuance were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding
under the Company’s prior revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes.

During November 2004, HCA entered into a $2.5 billion
credit agreement (the “2004 Credit Agreement”) with
several banks. The 2004 Credit Agreement consists of a
$750 million amortizing term loan which matures in 2009
(the “2004 Term Loan”) and the Credit Facility.
Proceeds from the 2004 Term Loan were used to refinance a prior
bank loan and for general corporate purposes.

During November 2004, HCA issued $500 million of 5.5% notes
due December 1, 2009 and issued $750 million of 6.375%
notes due January 15, 2015. Proceeds from the notes were
used to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and
for general corporate purposes.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, in response to the
Company’s tender offer to repurchase the Company’s
common stock, Standard & Poor’s downgraded
HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB- to BB+ and Fitch IBCA
downgraded HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB- to BB+.
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded HCA’s senior debt
rating from Bal to Ba2.

During December 2004, HCA filed a shelf registration statement
and prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
will allow the Company to issue, from time to time, up to
$1.5 billion in debt securities. As of December 31,
2004, HCA had not issued any debt securities under this
registration statement.

In February 2003, HCA issued $500 million of 6.25% notes
due February 15, 2013. In July 2003, HCA issued
$500 million of 6.75% notes due July 15, 2003. The
proceeds from both issuances were used to repay a portion of the
amounts outstanding under the Company’s prior revolving
credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

During November 2003, HCA issued $350 million of 5.25%
notes due November 6, 2008 and issued $250 million of
7.5% notes due November 6, 2033. Proceeds from the notes
were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under
the Company’s prior revolving credit facility.

CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

Financing Activities (Continued)

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts
available under the Credit Facility and HCA’s anticipated
access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to
meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

Systems Development Projects

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue activities
associated with the development of a patient accounting software
system, resulting in a pretax charge of $130 million. HCA
had estimated that the patient accounting project would have
required total expenditures of approximately $400 million
to develop and install. HCA is in the process of implementing
projects to replace its payroll and human resources information
systems. Management estimates that the payroll and human
resources system projects will require total expenditures of
approximately $330 million to develop and install. At
December 31, 2004, project-to-date costs incurred were
$245 million ($151 million of the costs incurred have
been capitalized and $94 million have been expensed).
Management expects that the system development, testing, data
conversion and installation activities will continue through
2006. There can be no assurance that the development and
implementation of these systems will not be delayed, that the
total cost will not be significantly more than currently
anticipated, that business processes will not be interrupted
during implementation or that HCA will realize the expected
benefits and efficiencies from the developed products.

Market Risk

HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes in market
values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
$1.441 billion and $881 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2004. These investments are carried at fair
value with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded
as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair value of
investments is generally based on quoted market prices. If the
insurance subsidiary were to experience significant declines in
the fair value of its investments, this could require additional
investment by the Company to allow the insurance subsidiary to
satisfy its minimum capital requirements.

HCA evaluates, among other things, the financial position and
near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the
issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in
the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
“other-than-temporary.” The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Market Risk (Continued)

and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment to
allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s fair
value are important components of management’s investment
securities evaluation process. At December 31, 2004, HCA
had a net unrealized gain of $231 million on the insurance
subsidiary’s investment securities.

HCA is also exposed to market risk related to changes in
interest rates, and HCA periodically enters into interest rate
swap agreements to manage its exposure to these fluctuations.
HCA’s interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of
fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties,
based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.
The notional amounts and interest payments in these agreements
match the cash flows of the related liabilities. The notional
amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to
calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not assets or
liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or opportunity associated
with these swap agreements is offset by the opposite market
impact on the related debt. HCA’s credit risk related to
these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements
are with creditworthy financial institutions. The interest
payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis.
These derivatives and the related hedged debt amounts have been
recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair
values.

With respect to HCA’s interest-bearing liabilities,
approximately $2.8 billion of long-term debt at
December 31, 2004 is subject to variable rates of interest,
while the remaining balance in long-term debt of
$7.7 billion at December 31, 2004 is subject to fixed
rates of interest. Both the general level of U.S. interest
rates and, for the 2004 Credit Agreement, the Company’s
credit rating affect HCA’s variable interest rates.
HCA’s variable rate debt is comprised of the Company’s
Credit Facility, on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR
plus 0.4% to 1.0% (depending on HCA’s credit ratings), a
bank term loan, on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR
plus 0.5% to 1.25%, and fixed rate notes on which interest rate
swaps have been entered into, on which interest is payable at
LIBOR plus 1.39% to 2.39%. Due to increases in LIBOR, the
average rate for the Company’s Credit Facility increased
from 1.87% for the year ended December 31, 2003 to 2.18%
for the year ended December 31, 2004, and the average rate
for the Company’s term loans increased from 2.21% for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to 2.63% for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The estimated fair value of HCA’s
total long-term debt was $10.8 billion at December 31,
2004. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt
with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in
interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future
pretax earnings would be approximately $28 million. The
impact of such a change in interest rates on the fair value of
long-term debt would not be significant. The estimated changes
to interest expense and the fair value of long-term debt are
determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates
on HCA’s borrowing cost and long-term debt balances. To
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, HCA
generally targets a portion of its debt portfolio to be
maintained at fixed rates.

Foreign operations and the related market risks associated with
foreign currency are currently insignificant to HCA’s
results of operations and financial position.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various Federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
certain cases, limit HCA’s ability to increase prices.
Revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to
Medicare patients are established under the Federal
government’s prospective payment system. Total Medicare
revenues approximated 27% in 2004 and 28% in both 2003 and 2002
of HCA’s total patient revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry operating margins
have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure
because of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses
in excess of the increase



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices (Continued)

in prospective payments under the Medicare program. In addition,
as a result of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures,
HCA’s ability to maintain operating margins through price
increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the United
States Tax Court (the “Tax Court”), and the United
States Court of Federal Claims, certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2000 Federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 Federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1991 through 1993 Federal income tax returns and Healthtrust,
Inc. — The Hospital Company’s
(“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994 Federal income tax
returns.

During 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed a Tax Court decision received in 1996 related
to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of America’s
1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns, in which the IRS
contested the method that Hospital Corporation of America used
to calculate its tax allowance for doubtful accounts. HCA filed
a petition for review by the United States Supreme Court, which
was denied in October 2004. Due to the volume and complexity of
calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, the IRS has
not determined the amount of additional tax and interest that it
may claim for subsequent taxable years. In December 2004, HCA
made a deposit of $109 million for additional tax and interest,
based on its estimate of amounts due for taxable periods through
1996.

Other disputed items include the timing of recognition of
certain patient service revenues in 2000, the amount of
insurance expense deducted in 1999 and 2000, and the amount of
gain or loss recognized on the divestiture of certain noncore
business units in 1998. The IRS has claimed an additional
$404 million in income taxes and interest, through
December 31, 2004 with respect to these issues.

During 2004, the IRS began an examination of HCA’s 2001
through 2002 Federal income tax returns. The IRS has not
determined the amount of any additional income tax and interest
that it may claim upon completion of this examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded
to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. Management
believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation of America and
Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
the IRS during previous examinations and that final resolution
of these disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or financial position.

Controls and Procedures

1. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and
our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report.

2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Because of
its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore,
even those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2004.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.
Ernst & Young’s attestation report is included
herein.



(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that HCA Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
HCA Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that HCA Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, HCA
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our
report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of HCA Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 10, 2005

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Reporting Entity

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate
hospitals and related health care entities. The term
“affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2004, these
affiliates owned and operated 182 hospitals, 84 freestanding
surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary
services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in joint ventures
that own and operate seven hospitals and eight freestanding
surgery centers, which are accounted for using the equity
method. The Company’s facilities are located in
23 states, England and Switzerland. The terms
“HCA” or the “Company”, as used in this
annual report on Form 10-K, refer to HCA Inc. and its
affiliates unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. The majority
of the Company’s expenses are “cost of revenue”
items. Costs that could be classified as general and
administrative by HCA would include the HCA corporate office
costs, which were $162 million, $156 million and
$143 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
and entities controlled by HCA. “Control” is generally
defined by HCA as ownership of a majority of the voting interest
of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include
entities in which HCA absorbs a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity.
Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in entities that HCA does not control, but in which
it has a substantial ownership interest and can exercise
significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

HCA has completed various acquisitions and joint venture
transactions. The accounts of these entities have been
consolidated with those of HCA for periods subsequent to the
acquisition of controlling interests.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
are recorded based upon established billing rates less
allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
during the period the health care services are provided, based
upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
payers, including Federal and state agencies (under the Medicare
and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial
insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual
allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the
payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
Managed care agreements’ contractual payment terms are
generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem
rates or discounted fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded
estimates will change by a material amount. The estimated
reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost
reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are
determined (in relation to certain government programs,
primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the
“cost report” filing and settlement process). The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
in net increases to revenues, related to cost reports filed
during the respective year were $44 million,
$70 million and $45 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement
amounts, which resulted in net increases to

revenues, related to cost reports filed during previous years
were $26 million, $26 million and $31 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering
from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a
facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state
laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
require, and HCA’s commitment to providing quality patient
care encourages, the Company to provide services to patients who
are financially unable to pay for the health care services they
receive. Because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts
determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
revenues. During 2003, the Company announced that patients
treated at an HCA wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care,
who have income at or below 200% of the Federal poverty level
are eligible for charity care, a standard HCA estimates that 70%
of its hospitals were previously using. The Federal poverty
level is established by the Federal government and is based on
income and family size. On January 1, 2005, HCA modified
its policies to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do
not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
implementing the discount policy, HCA will first attempt to
qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other Federal or state
assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount will be
applied.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Carrying
values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Accounts Receivable

HCA receives payments for services rendered from Federal and
state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs),
managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies,
employers and patients. During the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 27%, 28% and 28%,
respectively, of HCA’s revenues related to patients
participating in the Medicare program. HCA recognizes that
revenues and receivables from government agencies are
significant to its operations, but does not believe that there
are significant credit risks associated with these government
agencies. HCA does not believe that there are any other
significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer
that would subject it to any significant credit risks in the
collection of its accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
off as uncollectable are deducted from the allowance and
subsequent recoveries are added. The amount of the provision for
doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of
historical and expected net collections, business and economic
conditions, trends in Federal and state governmental and private
employer health care coverage and other collection indicators.
The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for
doubtful accounts relate primarily to “uninsured”
amounts (including copayment and deductible amounts from
patients who have health care coverage) due directly from
patients. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal
and external collection efforts have been performed.

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Accounts
Receivable (Continued)

HCA considers the return of an account from the primary external
collection agency to be the culmination of its reasonable
collection efforts and the timing basis for writing off the
account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific
identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff
adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management
relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical
writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of HCA’s revenues and accounts receivable (the
“hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of
information to utilize in estimating the collectability of
HCA’s accounts receivable. The Company had previously
performed the hindsight analysis on an annual basis. During the
third quarter of 2003, the Company began performing a quarterly,
rolling twelve-month hindsight analysis to enable it to react
more quickly to trends affecting the collectability of the
accounts receivable. During the fourth quarter of 2004, HCA
refined its allowance for doubtful accounts estimation process
related to estimated recoveries associated with Medicare
copayments and deductibles and collection agency placements. At
December 31, 2004, HCA’s allowance for doubtful
accounts represented approximately 78% of the
$3.762 billion patient due accounts receivable balance,
including accounts related to patients for which eligibility for
Medicaid coverage was being evaluated (“pending Medicaid
accounts”). The Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts represented approximately 90% of the
$3.254 billion patient due accounts receivable balance,
excluding pending Medicaid accounts. Revenue days in accounts
receivable were 48 days, 52 days and 52 days at
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Adverse
changes in general economic conditions, business office
operations, payer mix, or trends in Federal or state
governmental health care coverage could affect HCA’s
collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of
operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market.

Property and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
was $1.248 billion in 2004, $1.108 billion in 2003,
and $1.007 billion in 2002. Buildings and improvements are
depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
ten to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
generally from four to ten years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the lives of the
respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
deferred loan costs at December 31, 2004 and 2003 was
$138 million and $107 million, respectively, and
accumulated amortization was $39 million and
$32 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is included in
interest expense and was $14 million, $10 million and
$11 million for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate that
the carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) that are
expected to be held and used, might be impaired, HCA prepares
projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the assets and their eventual
disposition. If the projections indicate that the recorded
amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are
reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated
based upon internal evaluations of each market that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities and independent appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Goodwill

HCA adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”) on January 1, 2002. Under
SFAS 142, goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to
annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment
reviews, impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances
indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing for
goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are
one level below the business segment level, and HCA’s
impairment testing is performed at the operating division level.
The Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit assets
to the carrying amount on at least an annual basis to determine
if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the
reporting unit assets is less than its carrying value, the
Company compares the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying
value. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value of
goodwill is estimated based upon internal evaluations of the
related long-lived assets for each reporting unit that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows and reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities. No goodwill impairment
losses were recognized during 2004, 2003 or 2002.

During 2004, goodwill increased by $53 million related to
acquisitions and increased by $6 million related to foreign
currency translation adjustments. During 2003, goodwill
increased by $491 million related to acquisitions,
decreased by $13 million related to facilities that were
sold and increased by $9 million related to foreign
currency translation adjustments.

Professional Liability Claims

A substantial portion of HCA’s professional liability risks
is insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of HCA,
which is funded annually. Reserves for professional liability
risks were $1.593 billion and $1.624 billion at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The current
portion of the reserves, $310 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, is included in “other accrued expenses”
in the consolidated balance sheet. Provisions for losses related
to professional liability risks were $291 million,
$380 million and $315 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are
included in “other operating expenses” in the
Company’s consolidated income statement. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks are based upon
actuarially determined estimates. Loss and loss expense reserves
represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and
unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated
balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss
expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations
and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the
effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The estimates
are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as
experience develops or new information becomes known. The
adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in
current operating results. The provision for losses for 2004
includes a $59 million reduction to the Company’s
estimated professional liability insurance reserves. The amount
of the change to the estimated professional liability insurance
reserves was determined based upon the semiannual, independent
actuarial analyses, which noted favorable claim and payment
trends, the adoption of tort reform and limitations on losses in
certain states and low inflation rates. HCA believes the
favorable claim and payment trends are, in part, the result of
the Company’s patient safety programs. The reserves for
professional liability risks cover approximately 3,500 and 3,900
individual claims at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and estimates for potential unreported claims. The
time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending
upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or
litigated. During 2004 and 2003, $268 million and
$264 million, respectively, of payments (net of reinsurance
recoveries of $21 million and $32 million,
respectively) were made for professional and general liability
claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year
can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is
inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, management
believes that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are
adequate; however, there can be no assurance that the ultimate
liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Professional Liability Claims (Continued)

HCA’s facilities are insured by the wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary for losses up to $25 million per occurrence. The
insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional
liability risks above certain retention levels in prior periods,
however, the insurance subsidiary obtained no reinsurance for
2004 and 2003. HCA also maintains professional liability
insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in
excess of amounts insured by its insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts remain on the
balance sheet, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
reinsurance contracts. The amounts receivable under the
reinsurance contracts of $79 million and $147 million
at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively, are included
in other assets (including $25 million and $29 million
at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, included in
other current assets). Transactions commuting certain
reinsurance contracts resulted in net increases to the reserves
for professional liability risks of $14 million and
$41 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. During
2003, the reserves for professional liability risks were
increased by $34 million related to the assumed obligations
of facilities acquired.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the investments of
HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as
“available-for-sale” as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and
are recorded in HCA’s consolidated balance sheet at fair
value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of
providing the funding source to pay professional liability
claims covered by the insurance subsidiary. Management performs
a quarterly assessment of individual investment securities to
determine whether declines in market value are temporary or
other-than-temporary. Management’s investment securities
evaluation process involves multiple subjective judgments, often
involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a
significant level of professional judgment in determining
whether factors exist that indicate an impairment has occurred.
HCA evaluates, among other things, the financial position and
near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the
issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in
the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent to which the
fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and
HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow
for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair
value, are important components of management’s investment
securities evaluation process.

Minority Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
entities that are controlled by HCA. Accordingly, management has
recorded minority interests in the earnings and equity of such
entities.

not recognize a gain or loss on the transaction. A relative
of a Director and former executive officer of the Company served
as the Chief Manager of MedCap.

In October 2003, MedCap sold its 113 MOB’s to Health
Care Property Investors, Inc. (“HCP”). The sale of
MedCap to HCP included HCA’s ownership interest in MedCap,
and HCA has no ownership interest in HCP. The distribution of
the MedCap sale proceeds resulted in HCA recording a deferred
gain of $80 million. The transaction is being accounted for
as a financing transaction and the potential gain amount is
being deferred due to HCA’s continuing involvement with the
MOBs related to certain contingent, protective put and call
rights. If the prohibited continuing involvement provisions were
remedied, a portion of the deferred gain amount would be
recognized currently and the remaining portion would be
amortized over the applicable lease terms for the MOBs in which
HCA leases space from HCP. The former Chief Manager of MedCap,
continues to manage the MOBs as an employee of HCP.

HCA leased certain office space from MedCap and, during the
years ended December 31, 2003 (through September 2003) and
2002, paid MedCap $16.1 million and $19.4 million,
respectively, in rents for such leased office space. HCA
continues to lease certain office space from HCP. HCA believes
its transactions with MedCap were on terms no less favorable to
HCA than those which would have been obtained from an
unaffiliated party.

LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. (“LifePoint”) and
    Triad Hospitals, Inc. (“Triad”)

In May 1999, HCA completed the spin-offs of LifePoint and Triad
(the “Spin-offs”) through the distribution of shares
of LifePoint common stock and Triad common stock to HCA
stockholders. In connection with the Spin-offs, HCA entered into
agreements to provide financial, clinical, patient accounting
and network information services to LifePoint and Triad. The
agreements have terms expiring in May 2009 for LifePoint and May
2008 for Triad. In addition, HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary provides insurance and risk management services,
negotiated on a year-to-year basis, to LifePoint and Triad. For
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, HCA
recorded $16.2 million, $11.9 million and
$11.8 million, respectively, related to LifePoint and
$51.1 million, $43.8 million and $46.5 million,
respectively, related to Triad pursuant to these agreements. The
fees provided for in the agreements are intended to be market
competitive and are based on HCA’s costs incurred in
providing the services.

Global Health Exchange, LLC (“GHX”)

In 1999, HCA formed empactHealth.com, with the intent of
improving its hospitals’ efficiencies in the procurement of
goods and supplies by utilizing the Internet. In January 2001,
empactHealth.com merged with Medibuy, an unrelated competitor of
empactHealth.com. As a result of the merger, HCA owned
approximately 17% of Medibuy and HCA’s directors and
certain members of its management owned approximately 2%. During
2002, HCA paid $2.4 million to Medibuy for annual software
license fees, transaction fees and related services, and paid
and expensed $3 million of additional investment payments
to Medibuy. During 2002, HCA’s management and directors
relinquished their ownership in Medibuy for no consideration. In
December 2002, Medibuy merged with GHX. As a result of the
merger, HCA owns approximately 7% of GHX and an officer of HCA
serves on GHX’s board of directors. In 2004, HCA and GHX
entered into a master user agreement, which expires on
December 31, 2008, pursuant to which GHX provides access to
its e-commerce system, a license to certain requisitioning
software and other services. During 2004 and 2003,

through 2008. Healthtrust Purchasing Group (“HPG”), an
affiliate of HCA, also entered into an e-commerce agreement with
GHX, which commenced on January 1, 2003, pursuant to which
HPG will be able to offer the GHX e-commerce system to HPG
members. HCA believes its transactions with Medibuy and GHX are
on terms no less favorable to HCA than those which would be
obtained from unaffiliated parties.

HealthStream, Inc. (“HealthStream”)

In October 2001, HCA entered into an amended four-year agreement
with HealthStream to purchase internet-based education and
training services. The agreement expires in 2005 and provides
for minimum fees of $2.5 million in 2005. During 2004, 2003
and 2002, the Company paid HealthStream $3.2 million,
$2.6 million, and $2.9 million which represented
approximately 16%, 15% and 18%, respectively, of
HealthStream’s net revenues. The Chief Executive Officer,
President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of HealthStream
is a relative of a Director and former executive officer of HCA.
HCA believes its transactions with HealthStream are on terms no
less favorable to HCA than those which would be obtained from an
unaffiliated party.

Share-Based Compensation

HCA applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
benefit plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for HCA’s stock options granted under the plans
because the exercise prices for options granted were equal to
the quoted market prices on the option grant dates and all
option grants were to employees or directors.

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), HCA has
determined pro forma net income and earnings per share, as if
compensation cost for HCA’s employee stock option and stock
purchase plans had been determined based upon fair values at the
grant dates. These pro forma amounts are as follows (dollars in
millions, except per share amounts):

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)

For SFAS 123 purposes, the weighted average fair values of
HCA’s stock options granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 were
$12.90, $13.49 and $13.30 per share, respectively. The fair
values were estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model with the following weighted average assumptions:

The expected volatility is derived using weekly, historical
market price data for periods preceding the date of grant. The
risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on four-year
United States Treasury Strips on the date of grant. The expected
life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be
held before it is exercised. The valuation model was not
adjusted for nontransferability, risk of forfeiture or the
vesting restrictions of the options, all of which would reduce
the value if factored into the calculation.

The pro forma compensation cost related to the shares of common
stock issued under HCA’s amended and restated Employee
Stock Purchase Plan was $9 million, $16 million and
$13 million for the years 2004,

2003 and 2002, respectively. These pro forma costs were
determined based on the estimated fair values at the beginning
of each subscription period.

Derivatives

HCA has designated its outstanding interest rate swap agreements
as fair value hedges. HCA has determined that the current
agreements are highly effective in offsetting the fair value
changes in a portion of HCA’s debt portfolio. These
derivatives and the related hedged debt amounts have been
recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their
respective fair values.

Recent Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which requires all
companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based
payments (including employee stock options) at fair value, and
is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. Retroactive application of
the requirements of SFAS 123 (as a result of the adoption
of SFAS 123R) to the beginning of the fiscal year that
includes the effective date is permitted, but not required. HCA
is required to adopt SFAS 123R in its financial statements
for the quarter ending September 30, 2005, and has chosen
not to apply SFAS 123 retroactively to the January 1,
2005 to June 30, 2005 period. SFAS 123R is expected to
have a material effect on HCA’s results of operations, but
it will have no net impact on HCA’s overall financial
position. The impact on results of operations of adoption of
SFAS 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will
depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, the impact of the adoption of the SFAS 123R
provisions on results of operations would have approximated, net
of income taxes, $191 million, $89 million and
$151 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. SFAS 123R also requires the
benefits of tax deductions in excess of amounts recognized as
compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow,
rather than an operating cash flow, as required under current
accounting guidance. This requirement will reduce net operating
cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods
after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those
amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among
other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount
of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such
excess tax deductions were $50 million, $31 million
and $82 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “2004
Act”) created a temporary incentive for U.S. companies to
repatriate certain accumulated income earned abroad by providing
a special 85 percent dividends received deduction (the
“repatriation deduction”), subject to certain
limitations and requirements, including adoption of a specific
domestic reinvestment plan for the repatriated funds. In January
2005, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published initial
guidance regarding the repatriation deduction. Certain technical
corrections related to the repatriation deduction are currently
pending before Congress and the Treasury Department is expected
to issue additional guidance during 2005. In December 2004, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Staff Position
No. 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for
Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004,” which allows companies additional
time to evaluate the effect of the repatriation deduction on
their income tax expense and deferred tax liabilities. HCA has
not yet completed this evaluation and accordingly, has not
adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liabilities to reflect
the repatriation deduction. Based on its current understanding
of the 2004 Act and its results of operations through
December 31, 2004, HCA believes that it may repatriate from
$0 to approximately $209 million in dividends eligible for
the repatriation deduction during 2005,

generating a corresponding tax provision benefit of $0 to
approximately $17 million from the reversal of previously
provided deferred tax liabilities related to unremitted earnings
of its foreign subsidiaries.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity” (“SFAS 150”). This statement
generally requires liability classification for two broad
classes of financial instruments. Under SFAS 150,
instruments that represent, or are indexed to, an obligation to
buy back the issuer’s shares, regardless of whether the
instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross physical basis, are
required to be classified as liabilities. Obligations that can
be settled in shares, but either derive their value
predominately from some other underlying, have a fixed value, or
have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite
direction as the issuer’s shares, are also required to be
classified as liabilities under this statement. In October 2003,
the FASB voted to defer, for an indefinite period, the
application of the SFAS 150 guidance to noncontrolling
interests in limited-life subsidiaries. The FASB decided to
defer this application of SFAS 150 to allow them the
opportunity to consider possible implementation issues that
would result from the proposed SFAS 150 guidance regarding
measurement and recognition of noncontrolling interests. HCA
will assess the impact of the FASB’s reconsiderations, if
any, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
when they are finalized.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the 2004 presentation.

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENT CLAIMS

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to its
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

During June 2003, HCA announced that the Company and the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) had signed
an agreement, documenting the understanding announced in March
2002, to resolve all Medicare cost report, home office cost
statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS (the “CMS
Agreement”) for cost report periods ended before
August 1, 2001. As a result of the CMS Agreement, HCA paid
CMS $250 million in June 2003. HCA recorded a pretax charge
of $260 million ($165 million after-tax), consisting
of the accrual of $250 million for the settlement payment
and the writeoff of $10 million of net Medicare cost report
receivables during the year ended December 31, 2001.

During June 2003, HCA also announced that the Company and the
Civil Division of the Department of Justice (the
“DOJ”) had signed agreements, documenting the
understanding announced in December 2002, whereby the United
States would dismiss the various claims it had brought related
to physician relations, cost reports and wound care issues (the
“DOJ Agreement”). The DOJ Agreement received court
approval in July 2003, and HCA paid the DOJ $641 million
(including accrued interest of $10 million) during July
2003. HCA also finalized an agreement with a negotiating team
representing states that may have claims against the Company.
Under this agreement, HCA paid $17.7 million in July 2003
to state Medicaid agencies to resolve these claims. HCA also
paid $33 million for legal fees of the private parties who
had brought

actions against the Company. In
connection with the DOJ Agreement, HCA recorded a pretax charge
of $603 million ($418 million after-tax) in the fourth
quarter of 2002. The consolidated income statement for the year

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2004, HCA opened one hospital, sold one hospital, and
closed two hospitals. During 2003, HCA recognized a net pretax
gain of $85 million ($49 million after-tax) on the
sales of two leased hospitals and two consolidating hospitals
and a working capital settlement related to a sale completed in
2002. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay bank borrowings.

During 2004, HCA did not acquire any hospitals, but paid
$44 million for other health care entities. During 2003,
HCA completed the acquisition of the Health Midwest hospital
system in Kansas City. The purchase price was allocated to the
related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their
respective fair values. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts and operations of the Health Midwest
entities subsequent to the April 1, 2003 acquisition date.
The pro forma effect of the acquired entities on HCA’s
results of operations for periods prior to the acquisition date
was not significant.

IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The carrying value for a hospital HCA closed during 2004 was
reduced to fair value of $39 million, based upon estimates
of sales value, resulting in a pretax charge of
$12 million. The 2004 impairment charge affected HCA’s
Western Group.

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue activities
associated with the internal development of a patient accounts
receivable management system, resulting in a pretax charge of
$130 million. HCA reduced the carrying value for
capitalized costs associated with the patient accounts
receivable management system components that were discontinued.

During 2002, management decided to delay the development and
implementation of certain financial and procurement information
system components of its enterprise resource planning program to
concentrate and direct efforts to the patient accounting and
human resources information system components. HCA reduced the
carrying value for certain capitalized costs associated with the
information system components that were delayed, resulting in a
pretax charge of $19 million. The 2003 and 2002 impairment
charges affected HCA’s “Corporate and other”
operating segment.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
on the Company’s operations or cash flows and are not
expected to significantly impact cash flows for future periods.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

During 2002, HCA recorded an other-than-temporary impairment
charge on investment securities of $168 million. The
investment securities on which the impairment charge was
recorded were primarily equity securities held by HCA’s
insurance subsidiary.

During the third quarter of 2002, HCA’s equity investment
portfolio experienced an increase in unrealized losses from
$135 million at June 30, 2002 to $214 million at
September 30, 2002. Management’s quarterly investment
securities impairment review process resulted in the
determination it had become difficult to overcome the
presumption the identified investment securities would not
recover fair value equal to cost prior to implementing any
investment alternatives being considered and a $168 million
other-than-temporary impairment charge should be recognized in
the third quarter of 2002. The investment securities on which
the impairment charge was recognized were primarily concentrated
in the communications and technology industries.
Management’s review of the individual investment securities
included considerations of the amount of market decline, the
length of time the securities had been in a decline position and
issuer-specific financial attributes. See
Note 8 — Investments of Insurance Subsidiary, for
a summary of HCA’s insurance subsidiary investment
securities. The impairment charge affected the “Investments
of insurance subsidiary” asset category and the

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the United
States Tax Court (the “Tax Court”), and the United
States Court of Federal Claims, certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2000 Federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 Federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1991 through 1993 Federal income tax returns and Healthtrust,
Inc. — The Hospital Company’s
(“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994 Federal income tax
returns.

During 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed a Tax Court decision received in 1996 related
to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of America’s
1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns, in which the IRS
contested the method that Hospital Corporation of America used
to calculate its tax allowance for doubtful accounts. HCA filed
a petition for review by the United States Supreme Court, which
was denied in October 2004. Due to the volume and complexity of
calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, the IRS has
not determined the amount of additional tax and interest that it
may claim for subsequent taxable years. In December 2004, HCA
made a deposit of $109 million for additional tax and
interest, based on its estimate of amounts due for taxable
periods through 1998.

Other disputed items include the timing of recognition of
certain patient service revenues in 2000, the amount of
insurance expense deducted in 1999 and 2000, and the amount of
gain or loss recognized on the divestiture of certain noncore
business units in 1998. The IRS has claimed an additional
$404 million in income taxes and interest, through
December 31, 2004, with respect to these issues.

During 2004, the IRS began an examination of HCA’s 2001
through 2002 Federal income tax returns. The IRS has not
determined the amount of any additional income tax and interest
that it may claim upon completion of this examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded
to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. Management
believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation of America and
Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
the IRS during previous examinations and that final resolution
of these disputes will not have a material adverse effect on
results of operations or financial position.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the investments of
HCA’s insurance subsidiary were classified as
“available for sale.” The fair value of investment
securities is generally based on quoted market prices. Changes
in temporary unrealized gains and losses are recorded as
adjustments to other comprehensive income. The aggregate common
stock investment is comprised of 491 equity positions at
December 31, 2004, with 468 positions reflecting unrealized
gains and 23 positions reflecting unrealized losses (none of the
individual unrealized loss positions exceed $1 million).
None of the equity positions with unrealized losses at
December 31, 2004 represent situations where there is a
continuous decline of more than 20% from cost for more than one
year. The equity positions (including those with unrealized
losses) at December 31, 2004, are not concentrated in a

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

HCA has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
interest payments between two parties based on common notional
principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-floating swaps
effectively convert fixed rate obligations to LIBOR indexed
variable rate instruments. The notional amounts and timing of
interest payments in these agreements match the related
liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis.

agreements at December 31, 2004 (dollars in millions):

Bank Revolving Credit Facility

HCA’s revolving credit facility (the “Credit
Facility”) is a $1.75 billion agreement expiring
November 2009. As of December 31, 2004, HCA had
$700 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.

As of December 2004, interest is payable generally at either a
spread to LIBOR, a spread to the prime lending rate or a
competitive bid rate. The spread is dependent on HCA’s
credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains customary covenants
which include (i) limitations on debt levels,
(ii) limitations on sales of assets, mergers and changes of
ownership and (iii) maintenance of minimum interest
coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2004, HCA was in
compliance with all such covenants.

Significant Financing Activities


In March 2004, HCA issued $500 million of 5.75% notes
due March 15, 2014. The proceeds from the issuance were
used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the
Company’s previous revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes.

Significant Financing Activities (Continued)

In November 2004, HCA entered into a $2.5 billion credit
agreement (the “2004 Credit Agreement”) with several
banks. The 2004 Credit Agreement consists of a $750 million
amortizing term loan which matures in 2009 (the “2004 Term
Loan”) and the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the 2004 Term
Loan were used to refinance a prior bank loan and for general
corporate purposes.

During November 2004, HCA issued $500 million of
5.5% notes due December 1, 2009 and issued
$750 million of 6.375% notes due January 15,
2015. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility and for general corporate
purposes.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, in response to the
Company’s tender offer to repurchase the Company’s
common stock, Standard & Poor’s downgraded
HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB– to BB+ and Fitch
IBCA downgraded HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB– to
BB+. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded HCA’s senior
debt rating from Bal to Ba2.

In December 2004, HCA filed a shelf registration statement and
prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will
allow the Company to issue, from time to time, up to
$1.5 billion in debt securities. As of December 31,
2004, HCA has not issued any debt securities under this
registration statement.


In February 2003, HCA issued $500 million of
6.25% notes due February 15, 2013. In July 2003, HCA
issued $500 million of 6.75% notes due July 15,
2013. Proceeds from both issuances were used to repay a portion
of the amounts outstanding under the Company’s previous
revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

During November 2003, HCA issued $350 million of
5.25% notes due November 6, 2008 and issued
$250 million of 7.5% notes due November 6, 2033.
Proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of the
amounts outstanding under the Company’s previous revolving
credit facility.

General Information

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2006 through 2009
(excluding borrowings under the Credit Facility) are
$647 million, $440 million, $746 million and
$885 million, respectively.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt
was $10.789 billion and $9.253 billion at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, compared to
carrying amounts aggregating $10.530 billion and
$8.707 billion, respectively. The estimates of fair value
are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.

CONTINGENCIES

Significant Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
asserted against the Company (see Note 2 —

resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory
proceedings could have a material, adverse affect on HCA’s
results of operations and financial position in a given period.

General Liability Claims

HCA is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
staff privileges. In certain of these

CAPITAL STOCK AND STOCK REPURCHASES

Capital Stock

The terms and conditions associated with each class of
HCA’s common stock are substantially identical, except for
voting rights. All nonvoting common stockholders may convert
their shares on a one-for-one basis into voting common stock,
subject to certain limitations.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In October 2004, HCA announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.501 billion of its common stock. In November 2004, HCA
closed the tender offer and repurchased 62 million shares
of the Company’s common stock for $2.466 billion
($39.75 per share). The shares repurchased represented
approximately 13% of the Company’s outstanding shares at
the time of the tender offer. HCA also repurchased
0.9 million shares of its common stock for $35 million
through open market purchases which completed this
$2.501 billion share repurchase authorization.

In April 2003, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase
$1.5 billion of its common stock through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2003, HCA
repurchased under this authorization 25.3 million shares of
its common stock for $900 million, through open market
purchases. During 2004, HCA repurchased 14.5 million shares
of its common stock for $600 million, through open market
purchases, which completed this authorization.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase up to
12 million shares of its common stock. During 2002, HCA
made open market purchases of 6.2 million shares for
$282 million. During 2003, HCA purchased 5.8 million
shares for $214 million, through open market purchases,
which completed the repurchases under this authorization. The
repurchases were intended to offset the dilutive effect of
employee stock benefit plans.

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a financial
institution that resulted in the financial institution investing
$400 million (at December 31, 2001) to capitalize an
entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This consolidated
affiliate acquired 16.8 million shares of HCA common stock
in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain forward
purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the financial
institution and received the 16.8 million shares of the
Company’s common stock.

During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the share repurchase transactions
reduced stockholders’ equity by $3.109 billion,
$1.114 billion and $282 million, respectively.

STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2000, the stockholders of HCA approved the HCA 2000
Equity Incentive Plan (the “2000 Plan”). The 2000 Plan
is the primary plan under which options to purchase common stock
and restricted stock may be granted to officers, employees and
directors. The number of options or shares authorized under the
2000 Plan is 50,500,000 (which includes 500,000 shares
authorized under a former plan). In addition, options granted
under the former plan that are cancelled become available for
subsequent grants. Exercise provisions vary, but options are
generally exercisable, in whole or in part, beginning one to
five years after the grant date and ending ten years after the
grant date.

options awarded to employees and officers which had exercise
prices greater than the closing price of the Company’s
common stock at December 14, 2004 of $40.89 per share.
Options to purchase approximately 19.1 million shares
became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting
acceleration.

Options to purchase common stock have been granted to officers,
employees and directors under various predecessor plans.
Generally, options have been granted with exercise prices no

HCA’s amended and restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) provides an opportunity to purchase shares of
its common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over
six-month periods) to substantially all employees. At
December 31, 2004, 6,562,500 shares of common stock
were reserved for HCA’s employee stock purchase plan.

Under the 2000 Plan and the Management Stock Purchase Plan
(“MSPP”), HCA has made grants of restricted shares or
units of HCA’s common stock to provide incentive
compensation to employees. The MSPP allows eligible employees to
defer an elected percentage (not to exceed 25%) of their base
salaries through the purchase of restricted stock at a 25%
discount from the average market price. Purchases of restricted
shares are made twice a year and the shares vest after three
years. Performance equity plan grants have been made annually,
based upon the achievement of specified performance goals.
Performance equity plan restricted shares vest over a two-year
period.

At December 31, 2004, 1,520,400 shares were subject to
restrictions, which lapse between 2005 and 2007. During 2004,
2003 and 2002, grants and purchases of 721,100, 1,039,900 and
870,900 shares, respectively, were made at weighted-average
grant or purchase date fair values of $44.88, $42.08 and
$42.72 per share, respectively, related to the performance
equity plan. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, grants and purchases of
158,900, 148,900 and 113,300 shares, respectively, were
made at weighted-average grant or purchase date discounted (25%

employee service. Retirement plan expense was $191 million
for 2004, $166 million for 2003 and $140 million for
2002. Amounts approximately equal to retirement plan expense are
funded annually.

HCA maintains contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
requirements. Certain of the plans require that HCA match
specified percentages of participants’ contributions up to
certain maximum levels (generally 50% of the first 3% of
compensation deferred by participants). The cost of these plans
totaled $51 million for 2004, $48 million for 2003 and
$47 million for 2002. HCA’s contributions are funded
periodically during each year.

HCA maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives a
prescribed life annuity from a combination of the SERP and
HCA’s other benefit plans. Compensation expense under the
plan was $8 million for 2004, $7 million for 2003 and
$9 million for 2002. Accrued benefits liabilities under
this plan totaled $52 million at December 31, 2004 and
$44 million at December 31, 2003.

HCA maintains defined benefit pension plans that resulted from
acquisitions of certain hospitals in prior years. Compensation
expense under these plans was $26 million for 2004,
$17 million for 2003, and $8 million for 2002. Accrued
benefits liabilities under these plans totaled $55 million
at December 31, 2004 and $28 million at
December 31, 2003.

NOTE 15 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION

HCA operates in one line of business, which is operating
hospitals and related health care entities. During all three
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately
27%, 28% and 28%, respectively, of HCA’s revenues related
to patients participating in the Medicare program.

HCA’s operations are structured in two geographically
organized groups: the Eastern Group includes
91 consolidating hospitals located in the Eastern United
States and the Western Group includes 83 consolidating
hospitals located in the Western United States. HCA also
operates eight consolidating hospitals in England and
Switzerland and these facilities are included in the Corporate
and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
and amortization, interest expense, government settlement and
investigation related costs, gains on sales of facilities,
impairment of investment securities, impairment of long-lived
assets, minority interests and income taxes. HCA uses adjusted
segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of
allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their
performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an
analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also
serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service
ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a
measure of financial performance under generally accepted
accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted
segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and
assessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA
is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to
varying calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may
not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. The geographic distributions of HCA’s revenues,
