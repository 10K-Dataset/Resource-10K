Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our
stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:

•

grow our presence in existing markets;



•

achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures;

•

recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services;

•

continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and

•

pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate
hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities,

walk-in

clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive
rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities.

At
December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 166 general, acute care hospitals with 43,778 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care,
diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized
medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community.

At
December 31, 2016, we operated three psychiatric hospitals with 412 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adolescent and adult alcohol and drug abuse
treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding
ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities,

walk-in

clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy
centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our
ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient
safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, accounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and coordination,
information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit services.

Sources
of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services
ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the
type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.



We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under
the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”)), private insurers and directly from
patients. Our revenues from third-party payers, the uninsured and other for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with

end-stage

renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states,
which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts
received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations
(“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans, including plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing
costs. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.” Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs
and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due
from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care under our charity care policy. In implementing our uninsured
discount policy, we may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the
“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025.



Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general,
acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group

(“MS-DRG”).

MS-DRGs

classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal
diagnosis.

MS-DRG

weights represent the average resources for a given

MS-DRG

relative to the average resources for all

MS-DRGs.

MS-DRG

payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on

MS-DRG

weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional
“outlier” payments.

MS-DRG

rates are updated, and

MS-DRG

weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the

MS-DRG

rates (the
“market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care
and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), provides for annual decreases to the market basket, including reductions of 0.75% for each of federal fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal
fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”)

10-year

moving
average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 requires negative documentation and coding adjustments for four years beginning in federal fiscal year 2014. CMS estimated in 2016 that,
over the four years, these documentation and coding adjustments will reduce Medicare inpatient PPS payments by $11.2 billion. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our
results of operations.

For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS increased the

MS-DRG

rate by 0.9%. This increase reflected a 2.4% market basket increase, the 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, and a negative 0.8% prospective
documentation and coding adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased the

MS-DRG

rate by 0.95%. This increase reflects a 2.7% market basket increase, the 0.75% reduction required by the Health
Reform Law, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment, and a prospective reduction of 1.5% for documentation and coding. It also reflects a positive adjustment of approximately 0.8% to remove the effects of prior adjustments intended to offset the
estimated increase in inpatient PPS expenditures resulting from the Medicare program’s “two midnight rule.”

Under the two midnight rule, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically
necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care are subject to medical review on a

case-by-case

basis. Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”) are handling the reviews of short inpatient stays and refer claim denials to Medicare
Administrative Contractors (“MACs”) for payment adjustments. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with the two midnight rule may be referred to a Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”).

CMS has implemented, or is implementing, a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a
passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to an additional 0.25% reduction of the market basket
update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (“EHRs”) are subject to an additional 0.75% reduction of the market basket update in federal fiscal year 2017.



Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a
higher paying

MS-DRG

if a selected hospital acquired condition (“HAC”) was not present on admission and it is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying

MS-DRG.

In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS has established three National
Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the
designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments.

The Health
Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the

30-day

time period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS has designated seven conditions, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty.
Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which
payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospital’s performance for each condition using three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals
with excess readmissions can be up to 3% for federal fiscal 2015 and subsequent years. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

The Health Reform Law additionally establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link payments to quality and efficiency. For federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years, CMS will
reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by 2.00%. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS
scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will
be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality
performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains: clinical care; efficiency and cost reduction; safety and patient and caregiver
experience of care. CMS estimates that $1.8 billion will be available to hospitals as incentive payments in federal fiscal year 2017 under the value-based purchasing program.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For
federal fiscal year 2016, CMS established an outlier threshold of $22,539, and for federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased the outlier threshold to $23,573.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient
services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical
diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications
(“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient
visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. The Health Reform Law provides for annual reductions of 0.75% to the market basket update in calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides
for the annual market basket update to be



further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year
2016, CMS decreased APC payment rates by an estimated 0.4%, which represented the market basket update of 2.4%, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.2% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. The rate also reflected other
payment adjustments, including a 2.0% reduction to address what CMS viewed as inflated payments in past years for laboratory tests packaged with payments for hospital outpatient services. For calendar year 2017, CMS has issued a final rule that it
estimates will result in a 1.7% increase in payments for hospital outpatient services. The change is based on a market basket increase of 2.7%, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.75% adjustment required by the Health Reform
Law, along with other payment adjustments. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional
diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels,

low-income

patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including annual reductions of 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2017, 2018
and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes
in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS updated inpatient rehabilitation rates 1.8%, which reflected a new inpatient rehabilitation-specific 2.4% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, a
0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law and a 0.1% increase to aggregate payments due to updating the outlier threshold. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased inpatient rehabilitation payment rates by an estimated 1.9%, which reflects
an increase of 2.7% to the

IRF-specific

market basket, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment, the 0.75% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, among other payment adjustments. In addition, CMS requires
IRFs to report quality measures to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update.

In order to
qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent

12-month

CMS-defined

review period must have required intensive
rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to

pre-admission

screenings,
post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under either the acute care hospital
inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2016, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 53 hospital rehabilitation units.

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis (the “IPF PPS”),
which is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facility’s base
payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care market basket update is used to update the IPF
PPS. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including reductions of 0.2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020. For each payment year, the Health Reform Law
provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal
year 2016, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by 1.5%, which reflected a new



inpatient psychiatric-specific market basket increase of 2.4%, reduced by a 0.5% productivity adjustment and by 0.2% as required by the Health Reform Law, along with other payment adjustments.
For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by an estimated 2.2%, which reflects an increase of 2.8% to the inpatient psychiatric-specific market basket, reduced by a 0.3% productivity adjustment and by 0.2% as
required by the Health Reform Law, among other payment adjustments. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2016, we had
three psychiatric hospitals and 54 hospital psychiatric units.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than
the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that
procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are
payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical
volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform
Law provides for an annual reduction to the ASC payment system by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2016,
CMS increased ASC payments by 0.3%, which included a consumer price index update of 0.8% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2017, CMS issued a final rule that provides for a 1.9% increase in ASC payments, which reflects a
consumer price index update of 2.2% and a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures will receive a 2% reduction in
reimbursement.

Physician Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (“PFS”) system, under which CMS has assigned
a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. While RVUs for various services may change
in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. The
Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”) provides for annual reductions in PFS expenditures resulting from adjustments to relative values of misvalued codes. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of work required in terms
of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to
account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), the PFS reimbursement rate will increase 0.5% each calendar year through 2019.

In addition, MACRA required the establishment of the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology
intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other health care clinicians are required to participate in of one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare
payments in 2019. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment
models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) if
the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM.



Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers electing this option initially may receive payment incentives or be subject to payment reductions of up to 4% of the
provider’s Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHRs. The adjustment percentage will increase incrementally, up to 9%, by 2022. MIPS
will consolidate components of three existing physician incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national
average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2017.

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance amounts that are
uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries.

CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively
bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 12 MACs, which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. While chain providers had the option of having all hospitals
use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically

re-solicits

bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a
result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow.

CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of quality concerns and detections and corrections of improper payments. QIOs, for example, are groups of
physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the RAC program, CMS
contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program. CMS awarded
new RAC contracts in 2016, although the original RACs will remain under contract with CMS until 2018 for administrative purposes. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance,
including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each
provider’s claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis, but has not yet expanded the RAC program as required by the Health Reform Law.

We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries
resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related to responding to RAC requests and
denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Currently, there are significant delays in the
assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. Depending upon changes to and the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Managed Medicare

Under the Managed Medicare program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with
Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private

fee-for-service

plans. The Medicare program allows
beneficiaries to choose



enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and expanded Medicare
beneficiaries’ health care options. The Health Reform Law reduced, on a gradual basis through 2017, premium payments to managed Medicare plans such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments generally approximate traditional
Medicare costs. In addition, the Health Reform Law requires managed Medicare plans to keep annual administrative costs lower than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law also implements fee payment adjustments based on service
benchmarks and quality ratings. The economic environment and changing health reform efforts may result in reduced premium payments from CMS, which may lead to increased beneficiary premiums or limits on benefits which, in turn, may cause decreased
enrollment in such plans.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under
approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The Health Reform Law, as
enacted, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (“FPL”) and to apply a “5% income disregard” to the eligibility standard, so that
eligibility is effectively extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the
Medicaid expansion. Some of the states that opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions are evaluating alternatives such as waiver plans to extend or replace existing supplemental payment programs. However, the future of the Medicaid expansion is
uncertain as a result of the 2016 federal elections.

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets
and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and
likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the

non-federal

share of Medicaid programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional
taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. However, for children, the Health Reform Law, as enacted, requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the
law until October 1, 2019.

Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse
providers for medical assistance provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other
provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state.

Congress has expanded the federal
government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), to perform
post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the Medicaid
Integrity Program and expands the RAC program’s scope to include Medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers.

Managed Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities
for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities,



usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. Many states direct managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated providers,
independent of services rendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of

low-income

patients. In 2016, CMS began limiting these “pass-through payments” to Medicaid
managed plans and will ultimately prohibit such payments by 2027.

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has
increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these plans, which may reduce
enrollment in these plans.

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives

An Accountable Care Organization (“ACO”) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in
infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and
operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared
Savings Program (“MSSP”), which was established pursuant to the Health Reform Law, and the Next Generation ACO Model.

The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (“CMMI”) is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the
adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to receive one
payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers
if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether
overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMMI has implemented a voluntary bundled payment program known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement
(“BPCI”) initiative. More recently, the CMMI implemented a mandatory bundled payment program for hospitals in selected geographic areas that is focused on orthopedic care and established a similar mandatory program focused on cardiac care
that is scheduled to begin in 2017.

HHS continues to focus on shifting from traditional

fee-for-service

reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and/or value, including bundled payment programs. Several private
insurance companies have expressed their intent to increasingly rely on such reimbursement models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to providers.

Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments

In addition to
making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of

low-income

patients (Medicaid and Medicare
patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to

MS-DRG

payments.

The Health Reform Law reduced Medicare DSH payments to 25%
of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively pooled, and this pool is reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in
the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the previously uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is then to be



paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of

low-income

patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion
to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program. Under current law, Medicaid DSH will be
reduced annually as follows: 2018 ($2 billion); 2019 ($3 billion); 2020 ($4 billion); 2021 ($5 billion); 2022 ($6 billion); 2023 ($7 billion); and 2024 and 2025 ($8 billion each). CMS issued a final rule in 2013 establishing the methodology for
allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. Under that rule, states largely retained the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among
providers within the state. However, due to the delays in the onset of the reductions, a new methodology will be required prior to fiscal year 2018.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health
care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to
that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.

Annual cost reports required
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the
final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 29%, 30% and 30% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 4% to 5% from managed care payers during 2016, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. Further, it is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law, and any changes to, or the
repeal or replacement of, the Health Reform Law, will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement rates.

Uninsured and

Self-Pay

Patients

Self-pay

revenues are derived from providing health care services to patients
without health insurance coverage and from the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered



by an individual’s health insurance plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or commercial payers. Any
increases in uninsured individuals, changes to the payer mix or greater adoption of plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals.

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended
December 31, 2016, approximately 83% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare
program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. The
Health Reform Law currently requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. The financial impact of
the obligation to screen for and stabilize emergency medical conditions has been offset, in part, by provisions of the Health Reform Law that decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives for individuals to
obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage.

Electronic Health Record Incentives

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive
payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology and provides for payment reductions for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that do not adopt and meaningfully use EHR
technology. The incentive payments are available for a maximum period of five or six years, depending on the program. Through December 2016, approximately $36 billion in incentive payments have been made through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR
incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals.

Hospital Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions
and market penetration of managed care programs.



The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health
care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months.

(a)

Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency.

(b)

Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned.

(c)

Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(d)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed
by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient
revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

(e)

Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals.

(f)

Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day.

(g)

Represents the percentage of hospital licensed beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and occupancy rate provide measures of the utilization of inpatient
rooms.

(h)

Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms.

(i)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not included in outpatient
surgeries.

(j)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not included in inpatient
surgeries.



Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals.
Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As
a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by

tax-supported

government agencies and many others are owned by

not-for-profit

entities that may be supported by endowments,
charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the

tax-supported

or

not-for-profit

entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities,
equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our
psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to
attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. Hospitals must make public a list
of their standard charges for items and services or their policies for providing a list of such charges in response to an inquiry. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
for patients and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors
to the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain
physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and
physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment,
employees and services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or
other clinical integration models.

Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our
ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition,
employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group
health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew
our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms
and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. The trend toward consolidation among

non-government

payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, health reform efforts, such as the Health Reform Law’s creation of the Exchanges and limitations on rescissions
of coverage and

pre-existing

condition



exclusions, may lead to

non-government

payers increasingly demanding reduced fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the
plans offered through the Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a
disfavored tier. These trends may continue regardless of potential repeal or replacement of, or changes to, the Health Reform Law. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on
the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care
facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional
or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services,
facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical
technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by payer-required

pre-admission

authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law expanded the use of
prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our
facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new
or expanded programs and services.



Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to
the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility
would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from

non-government

payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for
licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification
and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the
inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.

Certificates of Need

In some states where we operate
hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and
prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to
provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change ownership or other penalties.

State Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state.
In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in
such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in
any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospital’s participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. As required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, civil
monetary penalties were significantly increased in 2016. Beginning in 2017, the penalties are required to be updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index.



Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others from
directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held
that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to
violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $74,792 per violation, after taking into account 2017
updates, and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These civil monetary penalties will be updated annually based on
changes to the consumer price index. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) as a false
or fraudulent claim.

The OIG, among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating
fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and “Special Fraud
Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other
federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of
free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a
physician’s office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
remainder,

(f) low-interest

or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses
for conferences, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any,
substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities
to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their
physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such
information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing
guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint
venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing”
arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance
for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements
with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.



As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations
that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space
rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible
amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud
Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government
enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either
refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar
relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities
served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to
which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with
physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial
arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion
from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits
physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain “designated health services” reimbursable by
Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that
result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. “Designated health services” include inpatient and outpatient
hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care
programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a
penalty of up to $161,692 for a circumvention scheme. These penalties take into account 2017 updates will be further updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.

There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians
and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law
exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law



prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively
prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Health Reform Law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician
ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS
has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement
purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the
regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which we operate
also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. These state laws often apply regardless of the source of payment
for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social
Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered
in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and
managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited
activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid
beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting
or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to
report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for
reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions,
including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties of up to $74,792 per act, after taking into account 2017 updates, may be
imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the
remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially
where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least
$100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.



The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of
false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a

qui tam

plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the government’s behalf. The government may use the
FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges created
under the Health Reform Law, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a

qui tam

action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes
a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of
between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim. These penalties take into account 2017 updates will be further updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index.

There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a
false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or
falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the
FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims
under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should
have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment.

Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all
employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive
to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in
state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.

HIPAA
Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements

The Administrative Simplification
Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to
encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the
implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and
procedures known as

ICD-10

code sets. Health plans and providers, including our hospitals, were required to transition to the

ICD-10

code sets by October 1, 2015,
which required significant administrative changes.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant
to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to
implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on
behalf of covered



entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate
violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity.

Covered entities
must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in
certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All

non-permitted

uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the
information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to
$55,910 per violation for a maximum of $1,677,299 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, after taking into account 2017 updates. These civil penalties will be updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS
enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of
state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose
penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA
privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state
privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate
enforcement actions in response to data breaches.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties increased significantly in 2016, were further adjusted in 2017 and will be increased
annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a
civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which
individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are
transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a patient’s pending arrival in a

non-hospital

owned ambulance. EMTALA



does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively. We believe our hospitals
operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from
employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into

fee-splitting

arrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or
encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition,
agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public
attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or
state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse
publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We
continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and
constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been
available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under
the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state
government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement
initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste
and abuse, including $10 million in federal fiscal year 2017. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct
similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national
enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources;
physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices for

self-pay

patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities
that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture
arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional
investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.



Health Care Reform

The health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various scientific
and technological initiatives. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system. The 2016 federal elections may
result in the repeal of, significant changes to, or the replacement of the Health Reform Law, the most prominent of these reform efforts. Currently, the Health Reform Law affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through
expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration.

The Health Reform Law expands coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health
insurance and other reforms. Expansion in public program coverage has been driven primarily by expanding the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permitting individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. A number of
states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. For states that have not participated in the Medicaid expansion, the maximum income level required for
individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. Some of the states that have opted out of the Medicaid expansion are evaluating or participating in alternatives such as waiver plans.

The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law has been driven by new
requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. For example, health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon

pre-existing

conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage. Large employers are required to provide health insurance benefits to their full time
employees or pay a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. Individuals are required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or pay a tax penalty. The cost of obtaining health
insurance through the Exchanges is subsidized by the federal government for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL.

To facilitate the purchase of health insurance by individuals and small employers, the Health Reform Law mandates that each state establish or participate in an Exchange or default to a federally-operated
Exchange. Health insurers participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, as defined by HHS, and may offer more benefits. However, several insurers have limited or ended their participation in these marketplaces, creating
uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of the Exchanges.

As discussed in Item 1, “Business —
Sources of Revenue,” the Health Reform Law provides for spending reductions for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. It also increasingly ties payment for services to quality outcomes, provides for the creation of ACOs,
and creates incentives and other initiatives to better coordinate patient care across settings and over time.

The Health Reform Law also makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional
enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for

non-compliance.

For
example, the Health Reform Law tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments. The Health Reform Law also prohibits
newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid after
December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.



The Health Reform Law has had a net positive effect on the Company to date,
before considering the impact of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, and it is expected that the law, as presently implemented, will continue to have a meaningful contribution to the Company’s results of operations. However, the Company
could be affected by efforts to change, repeal or replace the Health Reform Law and the potential instability of the Exchanges, as discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”

General Economic and Demographic Factors

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human
service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United
States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements,
increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures, increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients
and further difficulties in our collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts.

Compliance Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics
and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health
Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify
our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation,

bid-rigging,

concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and
other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our
operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we
are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses
up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance



subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with
unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

We
purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cyber security incidents, directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The cyber security and directors and officers liability coverage each include
a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These
deductibles range from $100,000 per claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2016, we
had approximately 241,000 employees, including approximately 61,000 part-time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours,
benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2016, certain employees at 37 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2017, it is possible additional
hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have
experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve
retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed
physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and
obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s
medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of
other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required
to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor
pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Recent changes by the National Labor Relations Board (the “NLRB”) in its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization
attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing
ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

Item 1A.

Risk
Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our
business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and
operations.

Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to
fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.

We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was $31.376 billion. As of
December 31, 2016, we had availability of $1.767 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $330 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base
limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government
regulations;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore
reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, product or service line development,
debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and



•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less
highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness
in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could
intensify.

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not
be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.

In addition,
we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or
otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and
contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.

We may find it necessary
or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial
conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the
strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to
refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us
to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or
operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain
various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;



•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our
asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into
any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued
thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified
financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both
the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the
senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable
to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit
facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient
assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.

Our
hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.

The health care
business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our
hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for
the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Further, every
hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospital’s standard charges for items and services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or
on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has
increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or

not-for-profit

corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a

tax-exempt

basis. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or
other clinical integration models. Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs
are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ASCs. In states that do not require a CON or
other



type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.
Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at
their facilities than our hospitals and ASCs, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”

A deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.

The primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts
for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily
to amounts due directly from patients. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or
coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical write-offs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31,
2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from
$15.943 billion for 2014 to $18.287 billion for 2015 and to $20.455 billion for 2016.

Any
increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care as
a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and high unemployment. As a result of the 2016 federal elections, the provisions of the Health Reform Law that have reduced the number of uninsured individuals may
be repealed or significantly changed. Even if the Health Reform Law remains in effect, we will continue to experience collectability issues and provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to
implement the Medicaid expansion, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, some patients may choose to enroll in
lower cost Medicaid plans or other insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures that shift greater
responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.

Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and
Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 41.7% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2016. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of
operations. The Health Reform Law has made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change the Health Reform Law may impact these programs.

In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in
levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus



any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction
across all Medicare programs. These reductions have been extended by Congress through 2025. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress or whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the
automatic budget cuts. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and
Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the

MS-DRG

system and other payment systems, which may
result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, CMS has established what is referred to as the “two midnight rule.” Under the rule, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is
a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need fewer than two midnights of hospital care will be subject to medical review by
QIOs on a

case-by-case

basis. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with the two midnight rule may be referred to RACs.

Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest
program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in
managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result
in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and CHIP in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these
programs, and CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states’ programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Currently, Texas operates a Medicaid Waiver Program pursuant
to a waiver that CMS agreed to extend through December 31, 2017. Texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver through September 30, 2019. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended,
continue in its current form or guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid
program. For example, from time to time, Congress considers proposals to restructure the Medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states.

In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment
rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers.

Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care
programs and changes by commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

Our results of operations may be adversely affected if the Health Reform Law is repealed, replaced or otherwise
significantly changed. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future.

The Health Reform Law has reduced the number of uninsured patients to whom we provide health care services. It has done so primarily through the Exchanges and Medicaid expansion. It also, however, reduced
our Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, including reductions to “market basket” increases that took effect before the effective date of the market reforms and Medicaid expansion. Some of those decreases were substantial. Nevertheless, it
is expected that the Health Reform Law, as presently implemented, will continue to have a meaningful contribution to the Company’s results of operations.



However, many insurers have exited the Exchanges in the markets served by
the Company. To the extent some markets lack a sufficient number of insurers participating in the Exchanges, it could threaten the continued viability of the Exchanges in those markets.

In addition, it has been publicly reported that there are proposals being discussed in Congress and the administration to
repeal, amend or replace the law. Some of those proposals include age-based rather than income-based tax credits, as well as “risk pools” for those with pre-existing conditions. Further, there are proposals to create block grants to states
for Medicaid or to establish “per capita caps” on state Medicaid programs. Those block grants or per capita caps could apply not only to the Medicaid expansion under the Health Reform Law, but also to Medicaid as a whole. We cannot predict
whether any such repeal, amend or replace proposals, or any parts of them, will become law, and if they do what their substance or timing will be. The President of the United States has also signed an executive order that directs agencies to
minimize “economic and regulatory burdens” of the Health Reform Law. It is unclear what regulations or policies will be proposed and implemented pursuant to that executive order.

If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

If our volume of patients with commercial insurance declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate
favorable contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.

Nongovernment payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a
higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are

in-network,

and payers utilize plan structures to encourage
or require the use of

in-network

providers. Revenues derived from nongovernment payers (domestic only) accounted for 56.5%, 55.2% and 54.4% of our revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result,
our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by nongovernment payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities.

Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward
consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Nongovernment payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose
significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other
favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Our future success will depend, in
part, on our ability to



retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. It is not clear what impact, if any, future health reform efforts or the repeal of,
or changes to, the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in plan networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans or
experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.

The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining
good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve,
most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We may face increased challenges in this area as the physician population
reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet
the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.

Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel,
such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to
continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor
pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the NLRB’s modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee
unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals
or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory
nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in
order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along
increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make
significant changes to our operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and
complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;

•

appropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and
outpatient care;



•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;

•

necessity and adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical
records;

•

screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;

•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

debt collection;

•

preparing and filing of cost reports;

•

operating policies and procedures;

•

activities regarding competitors;

•

addition of facilities and services; and

•

environmental protection.

Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or
influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline
practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and
other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject
the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the
federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an
exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an
exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a
private person under a

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S.
and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that
they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.



We engage in consumer debt collection for HCA affiliated hospitals and
certain

non-affiliated

hospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Telephone Consumer Protection Act restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer
debtors regarding past due accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements.

If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including
civil penalties, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and criminal penalties.

We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In
the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these or other laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our
facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or
other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state
level may be adopted that adversely affect our business.

We have been and could become the subject of
governmental investigations, claims and litigation.

Health care companies are subject to numerous
investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain
overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject
to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the MACs,
fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.
Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.

CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and
correct improper payments in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program. The Health Reform Law expanded the RAC program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and
Medicaid claims. RAC denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. In addition, CMS
employs MICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments, and state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities.

Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the
findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.



Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies,
governmental or managed care controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to
reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as “utilization review,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the
review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by health plans. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient
utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization, coverage restrictions and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as plans that shift
increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies.

Volume, admission and

case-mix

trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our
control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens
and medical technology and other advances. These factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician
utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.

Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue
to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high
unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases
in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables.

The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable
adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does
not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called “never events”). The Health Reform Law also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance
provided to treat HACs. As of federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments.

Hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS will receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS
operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% for federal
fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years.



HHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital
services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years. HHS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain
quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that $1.8 billion in value-based incentive payments will be available to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2017 based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement
(relative to the hospital’s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise.

In 2016, CMS implemented a five-year mandatory bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services in selected markets. It
also established a new mandatory bundled payment initiative that is focused on cardiac care and is scheduled to begin in 2017. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality
standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Mandatory participation in demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results
of operations.

Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several
commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable
adverse events.

We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on
patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. CMS has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models, which may include additional mandatory bundled or other
alternative payment programs, and commercial insurers may also transition away from

fee-for-service

payment models. We are unable at this time to predict our future
payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues.

Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.

The performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services
initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management;

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and

•

monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.

Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network
failures, human acts and natural disasters. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we may experience system failures. The occurrence of any system failure could
result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our
business reputation.



A cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of a facility,
confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal
and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.

We
collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. In addition, we have made significant investments in
technology to adopt and utilize EHR and to become meaningful users of health information technology. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security
measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally
and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be
subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business,
including our ability to provide various health care services. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information
systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to
investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or
unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage and (vi) federal and state governmental inquiries, any of
which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

If we fail to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected.

As of 2015, eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR
technology in an applicable prior reporting period are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Failure to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and
results of operations.

The emergence and effects related to a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an
infectious disease could adversely affect our operations.

If a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an
infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to
accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might
cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production
and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic
or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.



State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care
facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.

Some states, particularly in
the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services
or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of
approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn,
adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the
operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.

A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other
purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of
health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of

not-for-profit

hospitals to

for-profit

entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or
other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of

not-for-profits

under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the
appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the

non-profit

seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the
purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations.
Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.

We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing
operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health
care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers’ compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek
indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the

pre-acquisition

conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.

Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic,
environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.

We operated 170 hospitals at
December 31, 2016, and 83 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. This
concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the



current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other areas across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas.
In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active
hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims by taxing authorities.

We are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc.,
its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will
not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results
of operations or financial position.

We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our
facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal
actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion
of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our 100%
owned liability insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims
exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rate changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt
and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $381 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $11 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short
notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.



Certain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA
founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and by members of management and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II, certain of these investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock
(approximately 18.6% as of January 31, 2017). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of
our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors and
any transaction that requires stockholder approval.

None.

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number of hospitals (general, acute care, psychiatric and rehabilitation)
directly or indirectly owned and operated by us as of December 31, 2016:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we directly or indirectly operate
118 freestanding surgery centers. We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Fourteen of our general, acute care
hospitals and two of our other properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under our senior secured cash flow credit facility and first lien secured notes.



We maintain our headquarters in approximately 1,800,000 square feet of space
in the Nashville, Tennessee area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain regional service centers related to our shared services initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in general,
adequate for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating their operation. Management does not believe that compliance with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect
our financial position or results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference
with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for additional taxes and
related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Under the federal False
Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states
have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal
and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or
liquidity.

Health Midwest Litigation

In October 2009, the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against HCA
Inc. in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri and alleged that HCA did not fund the level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA’s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central
issue in the case was whether HCA’s construction of new hospitals counted towards its $450 million five-year capital commitment. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely
fashion. On January 24, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and awarded at least $162 million. The court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA’s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and
uncompensated care during the ten years following the purchase. The court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees, which the parties stipulated were approximately $12 million for the trial phase. HCA recorded $175 million of
legal claim costs in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling, and consistent with the judge’s order, accrued interest on that sum at 9% per annum. On April 25, 2014, the parties stipulated to an additional $78 million
shortfall relating to the capital expenditures issue. HCA recorded $78 million of legal claims costs in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the stipulation, and accrued interest on that amount at 9% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of
the stipulation, the parties preserved their respective rights to contest the judge’s underlying ruling, whether through motions in the trial court or on appeal. On February 9, 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the part of
their dispute relating to charity and uncompensated care for $15 million. The foundation is required to use that amount, net of attorneys’ fees, for charitable activities in the Kansas City area. The parties also agreed on an additional
amount for attorneys’ fees for the plaintiff for the accounting phase of the case. The parties filed post-



trial motions, on which the court ruled on October 21, 2015. The court denied defendants’ motion to have the court change its rulings on liability and damages related to the capital
expenditures issue. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion for an award of additional

pre-judgment

interest, but did not specify whether the interest awarded was simple interest or would be compounded.
The court subsequently concluded that interest was to be compounded, and on December 9, 2015, the court entered judgment in the case in the total sum of $434 million, with interest continuing to accrue at 9% per annum, compounded
annually, from and after November 19, 2015, until the matter is resolved. On January 15, 2016, HCA filed a Notice of Appeal in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District, and oral arguments were presented during December 2016. On
January 17, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion that partly affirmed and partly overruled the trial court. The Court of Appeals ruled that the construction of new hospitals did qualify as capital expenditures, and that HCA had met its
overall $450 million five-year capital commitment. The Court of Appeals ruled, however, that certain interim milestones were not properly met, and consequently found HCA liable to the foundation for a shortfall amount plus attorneys’ fees. The
Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the issues of pre-judgement interest and compounding of interest. It entered a modified judgment in the amount of $188 million, plus post-judgement interest accruing at 9% per annum, simple interest,
beginning in December 2015. The parties subsequently reached a settlement whereby each side gave up their rights to seek further review in the Missouri Supreme Court in return for payment by HCA of $188 million (no interest was paid in the
settlement), which payment was made on February 1, 2017. The settlement agreement enabled HCA to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

Data

HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)



(a)

Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency.

(b)

Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned.

(c)

Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient
volume.

(d)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent
admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation
“equates” outpatient revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

(e)

Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals.

(f)

Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day.

(g)

Represents the percentage of hospital licensed beds occupied by patients. Both average daily census and occupancy rate provide measures of the
utilization of inpatient rooms.

(h)

Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms.

(i)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in outpatient surgeries.

(j)

Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in inpatient surgeries.

(k)

Revenues per day is calculated by dividing the revenues for the fourth quarter of each year by the days in the period. Days revenues in accounts
receivable is then calculated as accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, at the end of the period divided by revenues per day. “Revenues” used in this computation are net of the provision for doubtful accounts.

(l)

Represents the percentage of patient revenues related to patients who are not admitted to our hospitals.

2016 Operations Summary

Net income attributable to HCA
Holdings, Inc. totaled $2.890 billion, or $7.30 per diluted share, for 2016, compared to $2.129 billion, or $4.99 per diluted share, for 2015. The 2016 results include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, related
to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess
tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. The 2016 results also include net gains on sales of facilities of $23 million, or
$0.05 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and legal claim benefits of $246 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a previously disclosed contractual dispute
regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The 2015 results include net losses on sales of facilities of $5 million, losses on retirement of debt of
$135 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, and legal claim costs of $249 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. All “per diluted share” disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted
earnings per share were 395.851 million shares and 426.721 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 36.325 million and 31.991 million shares,
respectively, of our common stock.

Revenues increased to $41.490 billion for 2016 from
$39.678 billion for 2015. Revenues increased 4.6% and 4.1%, respectively, on a consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2016, compared to 2015. The consolidated revenues increase can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of
a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same
facility equivalent admissions.

During 2016, consolidated admissions increased 1.2% and same facility
admissions increased 1.1%, compared to 2015. Inpatient surgical volumes increased 1.4% on both a consolidated and same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 2.5% on a consolidated basis and increased
1.2% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015. Emergency room visits increased 4.1% on a consolidated basis and increased 3.8% on a same facility basis during 2016, compared to 2015.

For 2016, the provision for doubtful accounts declined $656 million, compared to 2015. The

self-pay

revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, for 2016, compared to 2015. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts,
uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016, compared to 31.5% for 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions increased
3.8% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for 2016, compared to 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 1.2% for 2015, compared to 2014.

Interest expense totaled $1.707 billion for 2016, compared to $1.665 billion for 2015. The
$42 million increase in interest expense for 2016 was due to an increase in the average debt balance.

2016 Operations Summary (continued)

Cash flows from operating activities increased $919 million, from
$4.734 billion for 2015 to $5.653 billion for 2016. The increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the
communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following
growth agenda:

Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets.

We believe we are well positioned in a number of
large and growing markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and strategically collaborating with the physician community
and adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency services, oncology and women’s services. Additional components of our growth strategy include expanding our footprint through developing various outpatient access points,
including surgery centers, urgent care clinics, freestanding emergency departments and

walk-in

clinics.

Achieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical and Satisfaction Measures.

Achieving high levels of patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are central goals of our business
model. To achieve these goals, we have implemented a number of initiatives including infection reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We routinely analyze operational
practices from our best-performing hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide performance improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us achieve cost
efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably position us in an environment where our constituents are increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.

Recruit and Employ Physicians to Meet Need for High Quality Health Services.

We depend on the quality and
dedication of the health care providers and other team members who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and strategically collaborate with physicians and other
professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe our
continued investment in the employment, recruitment and retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our facilities.

Continue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to Enhance Profitability.

We believe there is significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of our company by fully leveraging
the scale and scope of our franchise. We are currently investing in initiatives such as additional care navigators, clinical data exchange and centralized patient transfer operations, which will enable us to improve coordination of care and patient
retention across our markets. We believe our centrally managed business processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs effectively. We continue to invest in our
Parallon subsidiary group to leverage key components of our support infrastructure, including revenue cycle management, health care group purchasing, supply chain management and staffing functions.

Business Strategy (continued)

Pursue a Disciplined Development Strategy.

We continue to believe
there are significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will continue to provide financial and operational resources to analyze and develop our

in-market

opportunities. To complement our

in-market

growth agenda, we intend to focus on selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient facilities and other health care service providers. We believe the challenges faced by the hospital
industry may spur consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence and access to capital will position us well to participate in any such consolidation. We have a strong record of successfully acquiring and integrating hospitals and
entering into joint ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from
payers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject
to interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.
Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We have
invested significant resources to refine and improve our billing systems and the information system data used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed standardized calculation processes and related training programs to improve the
utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”)
requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an
emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an
individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA, require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
financially unable to pay for the health care services they receive. The Health Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a
participating provider contract is in place. Further, the Health Reform Law contains provisions that are decreasing the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements or incentives for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide,
insurance coverage. These mandates are

reducing the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, the 2016 federal elections may result in the repeal or relacement of, or significant changes
to, the Health Reform Law, which could impact the number of uninsured individuals and coverage for care provided to screen for and stabilize such conditions.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals for
nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is established by the federal government and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts from our
gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. After the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients’ accounts, and we record significant provisions for
doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and documentation of health care services authorized and provided, the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement are often subject
to interpretations that could result in payments that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related
primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year were $31 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to
revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were $90 million, $85 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect adjustments during the next 12 months related to Medicare and
Medicaid cost report filings and settlements will result in increases to revenues generally similar to the amounts recorded during these years.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance.
The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and
copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts,
regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection
criteria, upon completion of our primary internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary internal or external collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The
accounts that are not collected by the secondary collection agency are written off when secondary collection efforts are completed (usually within 12 months). Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process requires a
writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state, and private

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of our revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly
changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful accounts or

period-to-period

comparisons of
our results of operations. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion and 94.5% of the $5.636 billion, respectively, patient due accounts receivable
balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending accounts is included in our patient due
accounts receivable balance.

To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we
believe it is beneficial to view the revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years
ended December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as
a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care was 33.0% for 2016, 31.5% for 2015 and 30.2% for 2014. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days, 53 days and 54 days at
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the challenges related to the collection of the patient due accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients having adequate health care coverage,
increases in patient responsibility amounts under certain health care coverages, general economic conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage could
affect the collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payer classification
as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 is set forth in the following table:

Professional Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in an environment with professional liability risks. Our
facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional
liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in excess of $50 million per occurrence. Provisions for losses related to professional
liability risks were $430 million, $344 million and $395 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The estimated
ultimate cost includes estimates of direct expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does not include the general overhead costs of our insurance subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are established based upon
the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates
regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals. Several
actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss development to
estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which
add expected development to actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses. These methods use our company-specific historical claims data and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and payment data collected over an
approximate

20-year

period is used in our reserve estimation process. This company-specific

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

Professional Liability Claims (continued)

data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital
statistical data, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.

Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance contracts, were
$1.358 billion to $1.625 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1.294 billion to $1.548 billion at December 31, 2015. Our estimated reserves for professional liability claims may change significantly if future claims differ
from expected trends. We perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our analysis, we believe the estimated
professional liability reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves for professional liabilities. A 2.5%
change in the expected frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $28 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $26 million. A 2.5% change in the expected claim severity trend could be reasonably
likely and would increase the reserve estimate by $102 million or reduce the reserve estimate by $93 million. We believe adequate reserves have been recorded for our professional liability claims; however, due to the complexity of the
claims, the extended period of time to resolve the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes, our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could change materially from
our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual
claims at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time
period between the occurrence and final resolution for our professional liability claims is approximately four years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual claim can result in an

occurrence-to-resolution

timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.539 billion and $1.465 billion at December 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The current portion of these reserves, $391 million and $350 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance and excess
insurance contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of
$45 million and $44 million receivable under reinsurance and excess insurance contracts at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively) were $1.494 billion and $1.421 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The estimated total net reserves for professional liability risks at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are comprised of $830 million and $863 million, respectively, of case reserves for known claims and $664 million and
$558 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but not reported claims.

Changes in our professional liability reserves, net of reinsurance
recoverable, for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Income Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary differences that arise from the recognition of items in different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed in our
income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed in future periods.

Although we believe we have
properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the
impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax return. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and circumstances related
to uncertain tax positions. If the realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current period. Final audit results
may vary from our estimates.

Results of Operations

Revenue/Volume Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and
negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health
plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our
guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care.

Revenues increased 4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015 and increased 7.5% for 2015
from $36.918 billion for 2014. The increase in revenues in 2016 can be primarily attributed to the combined

Revenue/Volume
Trends (continued)

impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues in 2015 can be primarily attributed
to the combined impact of a 1.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 5.5% increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.

Same facility revenues increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and increased 6.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2014. The 4.1% increase for 2016 can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 6.4%
increase for 2015 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

Consolidated admissions increased 1.2% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 4.1% during 2015 compared to 2014.
Consolidated surgeries increased 2.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 2.0% during 2015 compared to 2014. Consolidated emergency room visits increased 4.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 8.0% during 2015 compared to 2014.

Same facility admissions increased 1.1% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 3.4% during 2015 compared
to 2014. Same facility surgeries increased 1.3% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 1.8% during 2015 compared to 2014. Same facility emergency room visits increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015 and increased 7.0% during 2015 compared to

Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured admissions
increased 3.8% during 2016 compared to 2015. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 1.2% and same facility uninsured admissions increased 4.5% during 2015 compared to 2014.

The approximate percentages of our admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed
care and other insurers, and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth below.

The approximate percentages of our inpatient revenues, before provision
for doubtful accounts, related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care plans and other insurers, and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth below.

At December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 43 hospitals and 32 surgery centers in
the state of Florida. Our Florida facilities’ revenues totaled $9.522 billion, $9.059 billion and $8.336 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we owned and
operated 40 hospitals and 26 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled $9.898 billion, $9.517 billion and $8.706 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
During 2016, 2015 and 2014, 56% of our admissions and 47%, 47% and 46%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 69%, 68% and 66% of our uninsured
admissions during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from
government health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) approved a Medicaid waiver
that allows Texas to continue receiving supplemental Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its Medicaid managed care program. Texas currently operates its Medicaid Waiver Program pursuant to this waiver, which CMS has agreed to extend through
December 2017. Texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver and related funding through September 30, 2019. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended, be revised or that revenues
recognized from the program will not decline.

The Texas Waiver Program includes two primary components: an
indigent care component and a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (“DSRIP”) component. Initiatives under the DSRIP program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery
system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families they serve. We provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation with other
hospitals. The state of Texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. As a result of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in Texas have
available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer
some portion of these available funds to the state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal
Medicaid funds. The state then may make supplemental payments to

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

Revenue/Volume
Trends (continued)

hospitals in the state for Medicaid services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. Our Texas
Medicaid revenues included $370 million ($101 million DSRIP related and $269 million indigent care related), $347 million ($95 million DSRIP related and $252 million indigent care related) and $488 million
($97 million DSRIP related and $391 million indigent care related) during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of Medicaid supplemental payments.

In addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and some states have made
waiver requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being
reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

(a)

Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient volume.

(b)

Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent admissions are computed
by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue. The equivalent admissions computation “equates” outpatient
revenue to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

$3.913 billion in 2015 to $3.257 billion in 2016. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for
patients who have health care coverage. The

self-pay

revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $469 million and $2.355 billion, respectively, during 2016 compared to 2015.
The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.0% for 2016 compared to 31.5% for 2015.
At December 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients
for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues increased
4.6% to $41.490 billion for 2016 from $39.678 billion for 2015. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 2.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared
to 2015. Same facility revenues increased 4.1% due to the combined impact of a 2.2% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2015.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.5% in 2016 and 45.7% in 2015. Salaries and benefits per
equivalent admission increased 2.1% in 2016 compared to 2015. Same facility labor rate increases averaged 1.9% for 2016 compared to 2015. Share-based compensation expense increased from $239 million in 2015 to $251 million in 2016.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.7% in both 2016 and 2015.
Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 2.2% in 2016 compared to 2015. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased 4.6% for medical devices and 3.4% for pharmacy supplies and declined 0.1% for general medical and surgical items in 2016
compared to 2015.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was 18.1% in 2016 and 17.9% in 2015.
Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for losses related
to professional liability risks were $430 million and $344 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in provision for losses related to professional liability risks for 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to
$64 million of favorable development related to prior years’ claims recorded in 2015.

During 2016
and 2015, respectively, we recognized $12 million and $47 million of electronic health record incentive income.

Equity in earnings of affiliates was $54 million for 2016 and $46 million for 2015.

Depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenues, was 4.8% in both 2016 and 2015. Depreciation expense was $1.946 billion for 2016 and $1.880 billion for 2015.

Interest expense increased to $1.707 billion for 2016 from $1.665 billion for 2015. The increase in interest
expense was due to an increase in the average debt balance. Our average debt balance was $31.048 billion for 2016 compared to $29.718 billion for 2015. The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6% for 2015 to 5.5%

During 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes
due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using
proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million. During 2015, we redeemed all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of 7

% senior notes due 2021 and all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.500% senior notes due
2016. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans. The pretax losses on retirement of debt related to these redemptions were $135 million.

We reached a settlement agreement with the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City related to a previously
disclosed contractual dispute regarding our obligation to fund certain capital expenditures in connection with our purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The settlement agreement enabled us to reduce the accrual for this claim by
$290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million related to this litigation for 2016. We recorded $129 million of legal claim costs during 2015 related to this matter. We also recorded
$120 million of legal claim costs during 2015 to settle a securities class action lawsuit and related derivative actions.

The effective tax rates were 32.3% and 37.2% for 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provision for income taxes for 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily
related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $162 million related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of ASU

which requires the
excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2016 would have
been 37.3%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $567 million for 2015 to
$542 million for 2016. The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily to joint ventures in our United Kingdom market, a Texas market and an Oklahoma market.

$3.169 billion in 2014 to $3.913 billion in 2015. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for
patients who have health care coverage. The

self-pay

revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts declined $93 million and increased $1.693 billion, respectively, during 2015 compared
to 2014. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 31.5% for 2015 compared to 30.2%

patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Revenues
increased 7.5% to $39.678 billion for 2015 from $36.918 billion for 2014. The increase in revenues was due primarily to the combined impact of a 1.8% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a

5.5% increase in equivalent admissions compared to 2014. Same facility revenues increased 6.4% due primarily to the combined impact of a 1.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent
admission and a 4.6% increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2014. We recorded $142 million of Medicaid revenues during the second quarter of 2014 related to the receipt of reimbursements in excess of our estimates for the
indigent care component of the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program for the program year ended September 30, 2013. We recorded $94 million of Medicare revenues during the third quarter of 2014 as the settlement amount for certain claims denied by
Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) entities conducting reviews on behalf of CMS and pending in the appeals process. CMS offered an administrative agreement to providers willing to withdraw their pending appeals in exchange for a timely
partial payment (generally, 68% of the claim amount, subject to certain adjustments), which we accepted during 2014. All revenue amounts and revenue-related statistics for the year ended December 31, 2014 include the impact of these two items
that resulted in increases to revenues.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 45.7% in
2015 and 45.1% in 2014. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased 3.1% in 2015 compared to 2014. Same facility labor rate increases averaged 2.8% for 2015 compared to 2014. Share-based compensation expense increased from

2015 and 18.2% in 2014. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes.
Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $344 million and $395 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and the expense decline in 2015 was primarily due to favorable development related to prior years’
claims.

During 2015 and 2014, respectively, we recognized $47 million and $125 million of
electronic health record incentive income related to Medicare ($46 million and $118 million) and Medicaid ($1 million and $7 million) incentive programs.

Equity in earnings of affiliates was $46 million for 2015 and $43 million for 2014.

Interest expense declined to
$1.665 billion for 2015 from $1.743 billion for 2014. The decline in interest expense was due to a decline in the average interest rate. Our average debt balance was $29.718 billion for 2015 compared to $28.529 billion for 2014.
The average interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 6.1% for 2014 to 5.6% for 2015.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $498 million for 2014 to $567 million for 2015. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related
primarily to joint ventures in our United Kingdom market, a Texas market and an Oklahoma market.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses, servicing our debt, capital expenditures
on our existing properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care entities, repurchases of our common stock, distributions to stockholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash flows from
operating activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $5.653 billion in 2016 compared to $4.734 billion in 2015 and $4.448 billion in 2014. Working capital totaled $3.252 billion at
December 31, 2016 and $3.716 billion at December 31, 2015. The $919 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2016, compared to 2015, was primarily related to the $736 million increase in net income. The
$286 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2015, compared to 2014, was primarily related to the net impact of an increase in net income of $323 million and net negative changes in working capital items of
$59 million. Cash payments for interest and income taxes increased $85 million for 2016 compared to 2015 and increased $21 million for 2015 compared to 2014.

Cash used in investing activities was $3.240 billion, $2.583 billion and $2.918 billion in 2016, 2015 and
2014, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were $2.760 billion in 2016, $2.375 billion in 2015 and $2.176 billion in 2014. We expended $576 million, $351 million and $766 million for acquisitions
of hospitals and health care entities during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Planned capital expenditures are expected to approximate $2.9 billion in 2017. At December 31, 2016, there were projects under construction which had an
estimated additional cost to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $2.5 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $2.508 billion in 2016,
$1.976 billion in 2015 and $1.378 billion in 2014. During 2016, we had a net increase of $815 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.751 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2015, we had a net increase of
$778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $2.397 billion for repurchases of common stock. During 2014, we had a net increase of $778 million in our indebtedness and used cash of $1.750 billion for repurchases of common
stock. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $434 million, $495 million and $442 million, respectively. We paid debt issuance costs of $40 million, $50 million and $73 million
for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We, or our affiliates, may in the future repurchase portions of our debt or equity securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable
securities laws. At December 31, 2016, $1.853 billion of share repurchase authorization remained available under the $2 billion share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors during November 2016. Funds for the
repurchase of debt or equity securities have, and are expected to, come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.097 billion as of December 31, 2016 and
$2.277 billion as of January 31, 2017) and anticipated access to public and private debt and equity markets.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled $385 million and $482 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $215 million and $261 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance
subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were
$1.279 billion and $1.160 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to approximate $382 million. We estimate that approximately
$333 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.

Financing Activities

We are a highly leveraged company
with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $31.376 billion and $30.488 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our interest expense was $1.707 billion for 2016 and $1.665 billion for 2015.

During January 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due
2025. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.

net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

During March 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate
principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining
portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March 2023.

During August 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one

The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.

Management believes that cash flows from
operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

Contractual Obligations and

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2016, maturities of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are presented in the
table below (dollars in millions):

(a)

We have not included obligations related to unrecognized tax benefits of $418 million at December 31, 2016, as we cannot reasonably estimate the timing or
amounts of cash payments, if any, at this time.

(b)

Estimates of interest payments assume that interest rates and borrowing spreads at December 31, 2016, remain constant during the period presented.

(c)

The estimation of the timing of payments for professional liability claims beyond a year can vary significantly. The time period required to resolve these claims can
vary depending upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.

(d)

Amounts relate to future operating lease obligations, purchase obligations and other obligations and are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts also
include physician commitments that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet.

(e)

Amounts relate primarily to instances in which we have agreed to indemnify various commercial insurers and lenders who have provided surety bonds and letters of credit
to cover damages for legal cases which were awarded to plaintiffs by the courts.

(f)

In consideration for physicians relocating to the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the
respective communities, we make advances to physicians, normally over a period of one year, to assist in establishing the physicians’ practices. The actual amount of these commitments to be advanced often depends upon the financial results of
the physicians’ private practice during the recruitment agreement payment period. The physician commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on effective agreements at December 31, 2016.

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $381 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as
adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $11 million on the insurance subsidiaries’ investment securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short
notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with
creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these
derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income.

With
respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $3.902 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2016 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $27.474 billion at
December 31, 2016 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of
amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the
senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our long-term debt declined from 5.6% for 2015 to 5.5% for 2016.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $32.833 billion at December 31, 2016. The estimates of
fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would
be approximately $39 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a majority of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

Our international operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies have not been significant to
our net income, but unfavorable British pound to US dollar exchange rates during 2016 had a negative impact on comprehensive income.

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including interest rate exposures, and are not used for
trading or speculative purposes. We recognize derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or
in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains
and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting
from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare patients are
established under the federal government’s prospective payment system. Total

fee-for-service

Medicare revenues were 21.4%, 21.8% and 22.6% of our revenues for 2016,
2015 and 2014, respectively.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have been, and may
continue to be, under significant pressure because of changes in payer and service mix and growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing regulatory
and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to

non-Medicare

patients is limited.

Tax Examinations

During 2016, the IRS completed its
examination, resolving all outstanding federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.

Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes
in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.
However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

Controls and Procedures

1. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Rule

13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive
officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule

13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective, can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on our assessment under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2016.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that
audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form

10-K,

has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.



(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited HCA Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based
on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). HCA Holdings, Inc.’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Holdings, Inc.
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of HCA Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2016
and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 and our report dated February 22, 2017
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

R

EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of HCA Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HCA Holdings, Inc. at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its accounting for share-based payment accounting under Accounting Standards Update

2016-09,

Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting

, and applied the change on a prospective basis.

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HCA Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control
— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Reporting Entity

HCA Holdings, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The
term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2016, these affiliates owned and operated 170 hospitals,
118 freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary services. HCA Holdings, Inc.’s facilities are located in 20 states and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or
“us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA
and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
“control” as ownership of a majority of the voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include entities in which we absorb a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the entity. The accounts of acquired entities are included in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to our acquisition
of controlling interests. Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in which we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise significant influence, are accounted for using
the equity method.

The majority of our expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be
classified as general and administrative include our corporate office costs, which were $373 million, $327 million and $285 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates less
allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party payers. Third-party payers include federal and state
agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies (includes plans offered through the health insurance exchanges), and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care
health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed care agreements are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted

fee-for-service

rates. Revenues related to uninsured patients and uninsured copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts
applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record net self pay revenues at the estimated amounts we
expect to collect. Our revenues from third party payers, the uninsured and other for the years ended December 31, are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject
to interpretation. As a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates will change by a material amount. Estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final
settlements are determined (in relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
amounts and disproportionate-share funds related primarily to cost reports filed during the respective year resulted in net increases to revenues of $31 million, $48 million and $50 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts related primarily to cost reports filed during previous years resulted in net increases to revenues of $90 million, $85 million and $53 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition,

F-9


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Revenues (continued)

to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions
exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and state laws and regulations require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care encourages, us to provide services to patients who are financially unable to
pay for the health care services they receive. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is established by the federal
government and is based on income and family size. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or
charity care. In implementing the uninsured discount policy, we may first attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. If an uninsured
patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

To quantify the total impact
of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended
December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

A summary of the estimated cost of total uncompensated care for the years ended
December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

The sum of charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts, as
a percentage of the sum of revenues, charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision for doubtful accounts was 33.0% for 2016, 31.5% for 2015 and 30.2% for 2014.

Recent Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the International Accounting Standards Board issued a final, converged, principles-based standard on revenue recognition. Companies across

F-10


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)

Recent
Pronouncements (continued)

all industries will use a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The new standard, which replaces nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, will require significant
management judgments and change the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. In July 2015, the FASB decided to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year to annual and interim periods beginning
after December 15, 2017 for public entities and permit entities to adopt one year earlier if they choose. The FASB decided, based on its outreach to various stakeholders and continuing amendments to the new revenue standard, that a deferral was
necessary to provide adequate time to effectively implement the new standard. We are continuing to evaluate the effects the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements and financial disclosures. We believe the most significant
impact will be to the presentation of our income statement where the provision for doubtful accounts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item. We expect to adopt the new standard using the

The new guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e., Step 2 of the current
goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value (i.e., measure the charge based on the current
Step 1). ASU

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our
insurance subsidiaries’ cash equivalent investments in excess of the amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash equivalents as these funds are not available
for general corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks totaling
$565 million and $517 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, have been included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through available
cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs),
managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and patients. We recognize that revenues and receivables from government agencies are significant to our operations, but do not believe there are significant credit risks
associated with these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts.
Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of historical and expected
net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate to
“uninsured” amounts due directly from patients (including copayment and deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage). Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
performed. We consider the return of an account from the secondary collection agency to be the culmination of our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific
identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling
twelve-months accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% and 94.5%, respectively, of the $5.116 billion and $5.636 billion,
respectively, patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount
pending accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable balance. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days, 53 days and 54 days at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Changes in general economic conditions,
patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

or market.

Property and Equipment

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method, was $1.946 billion in 2016, $1.880 billion in
2015 and $1.798 billion in 2014. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from 10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to 10 years.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the carrying values of certain long-lived assets expected to be
held and used might be impaired, we prepare projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair
value less costs to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiaries

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the investments of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were classified as

“available-for-sale”

as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) No. 320,

Investments — Debt

and Equity Securities

and are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held for the purpose of providing a funding source to pay liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiaries. We perform quarterly assessments of individual investment securities
to determine whether declines in market value are temporary or other-than-temporary. Our investment securities evaluation process involves subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a significant level
of professional judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. We evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes
in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost is considered
other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair value,
are important components of our investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests. In addition to the annual impairment review,
impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below the business segment level, and our impairment
testing is performed at the operating division level. We compare the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit
assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an

impairment loss is recognized. Fair value is estimated based upon internal evaluations of each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of market multiples, revenues and cash flows and
reviews of recent sales of similar facilities. No goodwill impairments were recognized during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Since January 1, 2000, we have recognized total goodwill impairments of $102 million in the aggregate. None of the goodwill
impairments related to evaluations of goodwill at the reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill impairments during this period related to goodwill allocated to asset disposal groups.

During 2016, goodwill increased by $41 million related to acquisitions and declined by $49 million related to
sales, foreign currency translation and other adjustments. During 2015, goodwill increased by $323 million related to acquisitions and declined by $2 million related to foreign currency translation and other adjustments.

During 2016, identifiable intangible assets declined by $19 million due to amortization, foreign currency
translation and other adjustments. During 2015, identifiable intangible assets increased by $22 million related to acquisitions and declined by $22 million due to amortization, foreign currency translation and other adjustments.
Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over estimated lives ranging generally from three to 10 years. The gross carrying amount of identifiable intangible assets at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $184 million and accumulated
amortization was $79 million and $60 million, respectively. The gross carrying amount of indefinite-lived identifiable intangible assets at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $269 million. Indefinite-lived identifiable
intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests, and impairment reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist.

Debt Issuance Costs

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of debt issuance costs at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $334 million and
$318 million, respectively, and accumulated amortization was $164 million and $151 million, respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense and was $34 million, $35 million and
$42 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Professional Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were $1.539 billion and $1.465 billion at December 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively. The current portion of the reserves, $391 million and $350 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is included in “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance sheets. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were $430 million, $344 million and $395 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in “other operating expenses” in our consolidated income statements.
Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the
respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and
frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating results. The reserves for
professional liability risks cover approximately 2,700 individual claims at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 and estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction
and whether the claim is settled

or litigated. During 2016 and 2015, $357 million and $305 million, respectively, of net payments were made for professional and general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of
payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the
ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates.

A portion of our professional liability risks is insured
through a 100% owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance
subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance and excess insurance
contracts are included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as we remain liable to the extent the reinsurers and excess insurance carriers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance and excess insurance contracts. The amounts
receivable under the reinsurance contracts include $36 million and $35 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, recorded in “other assets,” and $9 million at both December 31, 2016 and 2015 recorded in
“other current assets.”

Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage interest rate risks, and are not used for trading or speculative
purposes. We recognize our interest rate swap derivative instruments in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically in stockholders’ equity, as a component of other
comprehensive income (loss), provided the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income
(loss), and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the forecasted transactions when they occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive
income (loss) is recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is terminated.

The net interest paid or
received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining term of the
debt originally associated with the terminated swap.

Electronic Health Record Incentive Payments

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for eligible
hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology. We recognize income related to Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments using a gain contingency model that is based upon
when our eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology for the applicable period and the cost report information for the full cost report year that will determine the final calculation of the incentive payment is
available.

We recognized $12 million, $47 million and $125 million of electronic health record
incentive income during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Stock Incentive Plan

The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Holdings, Inc. and its Affiliates, as Amended and Restated (the
“Stock Incentive Plan”), is designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth of the Company by attracting and retaining management and other personnel and to motivate them to achieve long range goals and further the
alignment of interests of participants with those of our stockholders through opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in the Company. Portions of the options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted share
units (“RSUs”) granted under the Stock Incentive Plan vest solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of time, and portions of the options, SARs and RSUs, and all performance share units (“PSUs”) vest based
both upon continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the achievement of predetermined financial targets over time. We granted 1,601,300 and 1,746,300 SARs and 2,628,500 and 3,105,000 RSUs and PSUs under the Stock Incentive Plan
during 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2016, there were 11,957,900 stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable, and there were 25,007,100 shares available for future grants under the Stock Incentive Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The HCA Holdings, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) was approved by the stockholders of the Company during the April 2014 Annual Meeting with 12,000,000 shares of our common stock
reserved for issuance thereunder. The ESPP provides our participating employees an opportunity to obtain shares of our common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over three-month periods). At December 31, 2016, 9,720,000 shares of
common stock were reserved for issuance under the ESPP provisions. During 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized $8 million of compensation expense for each year related to the ESPP.

Stock Option, SAR, RSU and PSU Activity

The fair value of each stock option and SAR award is estimated on the grant date, using valuation models and the weighted average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards under the Stock
Incentive Plan generally vest based on continued employment (“Time Stock Options and SARs” and “Time RSUs”) and based upon continued employment and the achievement of certain financial targets (“Performance Stock Options and
SARs”, “Performance RSUs” and “PSUs”). PSUs have a three-year cumulative earnings per share target, and the number of PSUs earned can vary from zero (for actual performance of less than 80% of target) to two times the
original PSU grant (for actual performance of 120% or more of target). Each grant is valued as a single award with an expected term equal to the average expected term of the component vesting tranches. We use historical exercise behavior data and
other factors to estimate the expected term of the options and SARs. The expected term of the share-based award is limited by the contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior is incorporated in the historical exercise behavior
data.

The straight-line attribution method requires that total compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is derived using historical stock price information for our common
stock and that of certain peer group companies, and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase our stock on open-market exchanges. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life
equal to the expected share-based award life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years a share-based award will be held before it is exercised.

nonhospital health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net
assets of these acquired entities aggregated $41 million, $323 million and $542 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the acquired entities

Our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 included tax
benefits of $162 million related to the adoption of ASU

2016-09,

which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Under ASU

2016-09,

we no longer record excess tax benefits (when the deductible amount related to the settlement of employee equity awards for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized for
financial reporting purposes) in equity. Instead, we recognize these tax benefits (and deficiencies, if applicable) as a component of our tax provision. This reporting change is applied prospectively and prior period amounts are not restated (the
excess tax benefits for the years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014, related to the settlement of employee equity awards, were $222 million and $150 million, respectively, and were recorded in equity). ASU

2016-09

requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, as previously required. We have elected to apply the change to
the statement of cash flows presentation prospectively.

During 2016, the IRS completed its examination of our
2011 and 2012 tax years, resolving all outstanding federal tax issues. We reduced our provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $51 million, including interest (net of tax), as a result of this resolution. The
provision for income taxes reflects $15 million of reductions in interest expense (net of tax) and $7 million and $6 million of interest expense (net of tax) related to taxing authority examinations for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our foreign pretax income was $149 million, $178 million and $238 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

A summary of the items comprising the deferred tax assets and
liabilities at December 31 follows (dollars in millions):

At December 31, 2016, federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (expiring
in years 2019 through 2035) available to offset future taxable income approximated $94 million and $103 million, respectively. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in any one year may be limited.

The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions):

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $418 million, including accrued
interest of $45 million and excluding $4 million that was recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets, as of December 31, 2016 ($554 million, $73 million and $6 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2015). Unrecognized tax benefits of $137 million ($233 million as of December 31, 2015) would affect the effective rate, if recognized.

Depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes, the completion of examinations by federal,
state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease within
the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.

NOTE 5 — EARNINGS PER SHARE

We compute basic earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. We
compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, SARs, RSUs and PSUs, computed using the treasury stock method. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we
repurchased 36.325 million shares, 31.991 million shares and 28.583 million shares, respectively, of our common stock. The following table sets forth the computations of

NOTE 7 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into
interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on common notional principal amounts and
maturity dates.

Pay-fixed

interest rate swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net
basis. The net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing of the related liabilities, for the interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of
the swap agreements represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions.

The following table sets forth our interest rate swap agreements, which have been designated as
cash flow hedges, at December 31, 2016 (dollars in millions):

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

Accounting Standards Codification 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC 820”) emphasizes
fair value is a market-based measurement, and fair value measurements should be determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities. ASC 820 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between
market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market
participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

Level 1
inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest
level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment.

Cash Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or
alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash traded instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price
transparency. The valuation of these securities involves the consideration of market factors and management’s judgment.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques,
including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest
rate curves and implied volatilities. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of these instruments.

F-23


HCA HOLDINGS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

NOTE 8 — ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)

Although we determined the majority of the inputs used to value our
derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by us
and our counterparties. We assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions, and at December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined the credit valuation adjustments were
not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

The following tables summarize our assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (dollars in millions):

Senior Secured Credit
Facilities And Other Senior Secured Debt (continued)

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear interest at a
rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing
for the relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage ratios.

The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and
some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends
and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the ABL credit
facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant.

Senior secured notes consists of
(i) $3.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.50% first lien notes due 2020; (ii) $1.350 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% first lien notes due 2022; (iii) $1.250 billion aggregate principal amount of
4.75% first lien notes due 2023; (iv) $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.75% first lien notes due 2019; (v) $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.00% first lien notes due 2024; (vi) $600 million

2026; and (ix) $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.50% first lien notes due 2027. Capital leases and other secured debt totaled $593 million at December 31, 2016.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate exposure of our debt portfolio. At December 31,
2016, we had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a total notional amount of $3.000 billion, in order to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments associated with the senior secured credit
facilities. The effect of the interest rate swaps is reflected in the effective interest rates for the senior secured credit facilities.

Senior Unsecured Notes

Senior unsecured notes consist of
(i) $8.391 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes with maturities ranging from 2018 to 2033; (ii) an aggregate principal amount of $125 million medium-term notes maturing 2025; (iii) an aggregate principal amount

NOTE 10 — CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL CLAIM COSTS

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference
with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are also subject to claims by various taxing authorities for additional taxes and
related interest and penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Under the federal False
Claims Act (“FCA”), private parties have the right to bring

have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal
and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or

NOTE 10 — CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL CLAIM COSTS (continued)

Health Midwest Litigation (continued)

capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA’s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central issue in the case was whether HCA’s
construction of new hospitals counted towards its $450 million five-year capital commitment. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. On January 24, 2013, the court
ruled in favor of the plaintiff and awarded at least $162 million. The court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA’s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care during the ten years
following the purchase. The court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees, which the parties stipulated were approximately $12 million for the trial phase. HCA recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the fourth quarter
of 2012 related to this ruling, and consistent with the judge’s order, accrued interest on that sum at 9% per annum. On April 25, 2014, the parties stipulated to an additional $78 million shortfall relating to the capital
expenditures issue. HCA recorded $78 million of legal claims costs in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the stipulation, and accrued interest on that amount at 9% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the parties
preserved their respective rights to contest the judge’s underlying ruling, whether through motions in the trial court or on appeal. On February 9, 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the part of their dispute relating to
charity and uncompensated care for $15 million. The foundation is required to use that amount, net of attorneys’ fees, for charitable activities in the Kansas City area. The parties also agreed on an additional amount for attorneys’
fees for the plaintiff for the accounting phase of the case. The parties filed post-trial motions, on which the court ruled on October 21, 2015. The court denied defendants’ motion to have the court change its rulings on liability and
damages related to the capital expenditures issue. The court granted the plaintiff’s motion for an award of additional

pre-judgment

interest, but did not specify whether the interest awarded was simple
interest or would be compounded. The court subsequently concluded that interest was to be compounded, and on December 9, 2015, the court entered judgment in the case in the total sum of $434 million, with interest continuing to accrue at
9% per annum, compounded annually, from and after November 19, 2015, until the matter is resolved. On January 15, 2016, HCA filed a Notice of Appeal in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District, and oral arguments were
presented during December 2016. On January 17, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued an opinion that partly affirmed and partly overruled the trial court. The Court of Appeals ruled that the construction of new hospitals did qualify as capital
expenditures, and that HCA had met its overall $450 million five-year capital commitment. The Court of Appeals ruled, however, that certain interim milestones were not properly met, and consequently found HCA liable to the foundation for a shortfall
amount plus attorneys’ fees. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court on the issues of pre-judgement interest and compounding of interest. It entered a modified judgement in the amount of $188 million, plus post-judgement interest accruing
at 9% per annum, simple interest, beginning in December 2015. The parties subsequently reached a settlement whereby each side gave up their rights to seek further review in the Missouri Supreme Court in return for payment by HCA of $188 million (no
interest was paid in the settlement), which payment was made on February 1, 2017. The settlement agreement enabled HCA to reduce the accrual for this claim by $290 million and resulted in the recognition of net legal claim benefits of $246 million
for the year ended December 31, 2016.

repurchase was made pursuant to the Company’s $1 billion repurchase program adopted by the Company’s board of directors in October 2014 which was completed during the fourth quarter of 2014 through market purchases of an additional
6.416 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $68.96 per share (14.029 million total shares repurchased at an average purchase price of $71.29 per share).

During May 2014, certain of the Company’s stockholders, consisting principally of affiliates of, or funds sponsored
by, Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (the “Selling Stockholders”), sold in an underwritten secondary offering, 15 million shares from their holdings of the Company’s common stock. The Selling
Shareholders received all the proceeds from this offering. Concurrent with the closing of the secondary offering, we repurchased approximately $750 million of additional shares (14.555 million shares) of our common stock from the Selling
Stockholders at the net offering price ($51.53 per share).

NOTE 13 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain defined contribution benefit plans that are available to employees who meet certain minimum requirements.
Certain of the plans require that we match specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending upon years of vesting service, of compensation deferred by participants).
The cost of these plans totaled $444 million for 2016, $432 million for 2015 and $404 million for 2014. Our contributions are funded periodically during each year.

We maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan to provide certain retirement benefits for eligible
employees. Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning eligible compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base and attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan year. Company credits to participants’ account
balances (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon participants’ compensation, years of vesting service and certain IRS limitations related to the HCA 401(k) plan. Benefits expense under this plan was $20 million for 2016,
$20 million for 2015 and $31 million for 2014. Accrued benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $175 million at December 31, 2016 and $164 million at December 31, 2015.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain executives (the SERP is not funded).
The plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the value of a prescribed life annuity from the combination of the SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the plan was $22 million for 2016,
$33 million for 2015 and $31 million for 2014. Accrued benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $222 million at December 31, 2016 and $207 million at December 31, 2015.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Benefits
expense under these plans was $21 million for 2016, $25 million for 2015, and $13 million for 2014. Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled $111 million at December 31, 2016 and $131 million at
December 31, 2015.

NOTE 14 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals and related health care entities. We operate in two
geographically organized groups: the National and American Groups. At December 31, 2016, the National Group included 84 hospitals located in Alaska, California, Florida, southern Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia, and the American Group included 80 hospitals located in Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. We also operate six
hospitals in England, and these facilities are included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment
EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs (benefits), income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests. We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care
industry, and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from
adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus
susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The geographic distributions of our revenues, equity in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment
EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, assets and goodwill and other intangible assets are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

INFORMATION (continued)

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company (“Healthtrust”)
is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes described in Note 9. Rule

3-16

of
Regulation

S-X

under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any
class of securities registered or being registered. We believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure
relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust. The corporate structure relationship, combined with the application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s consolidated
financial statements related to HCA’s debt and financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated financial
statements of HCA and Healthtrust present the identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, total stockholders’ deficit, net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash
used in financing activities. Certain individual line items in the HCA consolidated statements of stockholders’ deficit are combined into one line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of stockholder’s deficit.

Reconciliations of the HCA Holdings, Inc. Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit presentation to the
Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company Consolidated Statements of Stockholder’s Deficit presentation for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows (dollars in millions):

Due to the consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical
to the consolidated financial statements of HCA, except for the items presented in the table above, the separate consolidated financial statements of Healthtrust are not presented.
