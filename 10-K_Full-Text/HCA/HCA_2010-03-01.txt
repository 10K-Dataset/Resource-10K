PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in
    the United States. At December 31, 2009, we operated 163
    hospitals, comprised of 157 general, acute care hospitals; five
    psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. The 163
    hospital total includes eight hospitals (seven general, acute
    care hospitals and one rehabilitation hospital) owned by joint
    ventures in which an affiliate of HCA is a partner, and these
    joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. In
    addition, we operated 105 freestanding surgery centers, eight of
    which are owned by joint ventures in which an affiliate of HCA
    is a partner, and these joint ventures are accounted for using
    the equity method. Our facilities are located in 20 states
    and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,”
    “we,” “our” or “us,” as used
    herein, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise
    stated or indicated by context. The term “affiliates”
    means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and
    partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
    partners. The terms “facilities” or
    “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
    affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to
    employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of
    quality health care services in the most cost-effective manner
    possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a
    full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties
    as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology,
    neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic
    and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care
    services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals,
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and
    rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
    full range of mental health care services through inpatient,
    partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
    reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal
    executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville,
    Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is

(615) 344-9551.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. completed its merger (the
    “Merger”) with Hercules Acquisition Corporation,
    pursuant to which the Company was acquired by Hercules Holding
    II, LLC (“Hercules Holding”), a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group comprised of
    affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co., Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity
    (each a “Sponsor”), affiliates of Citigroup Inc. and
    Bank of America Corporation (the “Sponsor Assignees”)
    and affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr.,
    (the “Frist Entities,” and together with the Sponsors
    and the Sponsor Assignees, the “Investors”), and by
    members of management and certain other investors. The Merger,
    the financing transactions related to the Merger and other
    related transactions are collectively referred to in this annual
    report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger was
    accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements,
    with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and
    liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees. On April 29, 2008,
    we registered our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, thus subjecting
    us to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our common stock is
    not traded on a national securities exchange.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

•

maintain our dedication to the care and improvement of human
    life;

•

maintain our commitment to ethics and compliance;

•

leverage our leading local market positions;

•

expand our presence in key markets;

•

continue to leverage our scale;

•

continue to develop physician relationships; and

•

become the health care employer of choice.

Health
    Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals; freestanding
    surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
    oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
    physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2009, we owned and operated 150 general,
    acute care hospitals with 38,349 licensed beds, and an
    additional seven general, acute care hospitals with 2,269
    licensed beds are operated through joint ventures, which are
    accounted for using the equity method. Most of our general,
    acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services,
    including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care,
    diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute
    care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as
    outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy,
    cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized
    medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board,
    made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical
    research and education programs. However, some of our hospitals
    are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the
    clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other
    education programs.

At December 31, 2009, we operated five psychiatric
    hospitals with 490 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
    provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and
    adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug
    abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities which include
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers,
    comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
    centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
    various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
    integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive
    health care networks in select communities. A majority of our
    surgery centers are operated through partnerships or limited
    liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership
    or limited liability company typically held by a general partner
    or subsidiary that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management
    services to our health care facilities, including patient safety
    programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply
    contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing contracts;
    accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental
    reimbursement assistance; construction planning and
    coordination; information technology systems and solutions;
    legal counsel; human resources services; and internal audit
    services.



Sources
    of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
    provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
    the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
    reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
    depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
    medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the
    geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels
    fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
    control.

We receive payment for patient services from the federal
    government under the Medicare program, state governments under
    their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care
    plans, private insurers and directly from patients. The
    approximate percentages of our revenues from such sources were
    as follows:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
    medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
    disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and
    persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a
    federal-state program, administered by the states, which
    provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals
    who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute
    care hospitals located in the United States are certified as
    health care services providers for persons covered under
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare
    and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than
    established hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges
    to certain group purchasers of health care services, including
    private insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other
    managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit our
    ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs.
    See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
    Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
    between established hospital gross charges and amounts
    reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs or
    PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the
    extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of
    their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
    coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due
    from individuals is typically more difficult than from
    governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to
    uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
    care under our charity care policy. These discounts are similar
    to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an
    uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
    uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

Inpatient
    Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a
    prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
    care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient
    PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are
    established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare
    severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). The
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
    recently completed a two-year transition to full implementation
    of MS-DRGs to replace the previously used Medicare diagnosis
    related groups in an effort to better recognize severity of
    illness in Medicare payment rates. MS-DRGs classify treatments
    for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital
    resources necessary to furnish care for each principal
    diagnosis. MS-DRG weights



represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to
    the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are
    adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than
    those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for
    inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a
    geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat
    certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution,
    providers typically receive additional “outlier”
    payments.

MS-DRG rates are updated and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated
    using cost relative weights each federal fiscal year (which
    begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates
    (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the
    inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the
    health care industry in purchasing goods and services. In
    federal fiscal year 2009, the MS-DRG rate was increased by the
    full market basket of 3.6%. For the federal fiscal year 2010,
    CMS has set the MS-DRG rate increase at the full market basket
    of 2.1%. A decrease in payments rates or an increase in rates
    that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect the
    results of our operations.

In federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009, CMS reduced payments to
    hospitals through a documentation and coding adjustment intended
    to account for changes in payments under the MS-DRG system that
    are not related to changes in patient case mix. In addition, CMS
    has the authority to determine retrospectively whether the
    documentation and coding adjustment levels for federal fiscal
    years 2008 and 2009 were adequate to account for changes in
    payments not related to changes in case mix. CMS has not imposed
    an adjustment for federal fiscal year 2010, but has announced
    its intent to impose reductions to payments in federal fiscal
    years 2011 and 2012 because of what CMS has determined to be an
    inadequate adjustment in federal fiscal year 2008. Such payment
    adjustments may adversely affect the results of our operations.

Further realignments in the MS-DRG system could also reduce the
    payments we receive for certain specialties, including
    cardiology and orthopedics. CMS has focused on payment levels
    for such specialties in recent years in part because of the
    proliferation of specialty hospitals. Changes in the payments
    received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
    Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provides for rate increases at the
    full market basket if data for patient care quality indicators
    are submitted to the Secretary of the Department of Health and
    Human Services (“HHS”). As required by the Deficit
    Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA 2005”), CMS has expanded,
    through a series of rulemakings, the number of quality measures
    that must be reported to receive a full market basket update.
    CMS currently requires hospitals to report 46 quality measures
    in order to qualify for the full market basket update to the
    inpatient prospective payment system in federal fiscal year
    2011. Failure to submit the required quality indicators will
    result in a two percentage point reduction to the market basket
    update. All of our hospitals paid under Medicare inpatient
    MS-DRG PPS are participating in the quality initiative by
    submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor to
    comply with all data submission requirements as additional
    requirements continue to be added, our submissions may not be
    deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market
    basket adjustment for all of our hospitals.

As part of CMS’s goal of transforming Medicare from a
    passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and
    services, for discharges occurring after October 1, 2008,
    Medicare no longer assigns an inpatient hospital discharge to a
    higher paying MS-DRG if a selected hospital-acquired condition
    (“HAC”) was not present on admission. In this
    situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis
    was not present. Currently, there are ten categories of
    conditions on the list of HACs. Furthermore, on January 15,
    2009, CMS announced three National Coverage Determinations
    (“NCDs”) that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for
    erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or
    outpatient basis. These three erroneous surgical procedures are
    in addition to the HACs designated in CMS regulations. These
    changes are not expected to have a material effect on our
    revenues or cash flows.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of
    Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. CMS
    estimates that outlier payments accounted for 4.8% of total
    operating DRG payments for federal fiscal year 2008. For federal
    fiscal year 2009, CMS established an outlier threshold of
    $20,045, and for federal fiscal year 2010, CMS has increased the
    outlier threshold to $23,140. We do not anticipate the increase
    to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2010 will have
    a material impact on our results of operations.



Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
    Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
    who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS continues
    to use fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and
    speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic
    laboratory services and nonimplantable orthotics and
    prosthetics, freestanding surgery centers services and services
    provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into
    groups called ambulatory payment classifications
    (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
    and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
    established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
    hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
    The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2008 and
    2009 by market baskets of 3.30% and 3.60%, respectively. On
    November 20, 2009, CMS published a final rule that updated
    payment rates for calendar year 2010 by the full market basket
    of 2.1%. CMS continues to require hospitals to submit quality
    data relating to outpatient care to receive the full market
    basket increase under the outpatient PPS in calendar year 2010.
    CMS required hospitals to report data on eleven quality measures
    in calendar year 2009 for the payment determination in calendar
    year 2010 and will continue to require hospitals to report the
    existing eleven quality measures in calendar year 2010 for the
    2011 payment determination. Hospitals that fail to submit such
    data will receive the market basket update minus two percentage
    points for the outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities
    (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under IRF PPS, patients are
    classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
    comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the
    patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a
    predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
    patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
    levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
    The Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s Health
    Insurance Program (“SCHIP”) Reauthorization Act of
    2007 eliminated the market basket update for federal fiscal year
    2009. However, CMS issued a final rule setting the market basket
    update at 2.5% for fiscal year 2010. As of December 31,
    2009, we had one rehabilitation hospital, which is operated
    through a joint venture, and 46 hospital rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
    criteria for being classified as an IRF. Pursuant to that final
    rule, 75% of a facility’s inpatients over a given year had
    to have been treated for at least one of 10 specified
    conditions, and a subsequent regulation expanded the number of
    specified conditions to 13. Since then, several statutory and
    regulatory adjustments have been made to the rule, including
    adjustments to the percentage of a facility’s patients that
    must be treated for one of the 13 specified conditions.
    Currently, the compliance threshold is set by statute at 60%.
    Implementation of this 60% threshold has reduced our IRF
    admissions and can be expected to continue to restrict the
    treatment of patients whose medical conditions do not meet any
    of the 13 approved conditions. In addition, effective
    January 1, 2010, IRFs must meet additional coverage
    criteria, including patient selection and care requirements
    relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission
    evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of
    rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60%
    threshold or other criteria to be classified as an IRF will be
    paid under the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS,
    which generally provide for lower payment amounts.

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals
    and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and
    critical access hospitals are reimbursed under a prospective
    payment system (“IPF PPS”), a per diem payment, with
    adjustments to account for certain patient and facility
    characteristics. IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy
    for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a
    facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service
    emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment
    rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral and has adopted a
    July 1 update cycle. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and
    long-term care (“RPL”) market basket update is used to
    update the IPF PPS. The annual RPL market basket update for rate
    year 2010 is 2.1%. As of December 31, 2009, we had five
    psychiatric hospitals and 32 hospital psychiatric units.



Ambulatory
    Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”)
    using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC
    overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs
    paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare
    hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. Effective
    January 1, 2008, ASC payment groups increased from nine
    clinically disparate payment groups to an extensive list of
    covered surgical procedures among the APCs used under the
    outpatient PPS for these surgical services. Because the new
    payment system has a significant impact on payments for certain
    procedures, CMS has established a four-year transition period
    for implementing the required payment rates. Moreover, if CMS
    determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a
    physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that
    procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the
    Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, all surgical procedures, other than
    those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require
    an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. As a result,
    more Medicare procedures now performed in hospitals may be moved
    to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more
    Medicare procedures now performed in ASCs may be moved to
    physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may
    adopt similar policies.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area
    differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
    reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area
    compared to the national average wage level. Beginning in
    federal fiscal year 2007, CMS adjusted 100% of the wage index
    factor for occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage
    index changes, while slightly negative in the aggregate, is not
    anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2010.

As required by the MMA, CMS is implementing contractor reform
    whereby CMS has competitively bid the Medicare fiscal
    intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare
    Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are
    geographically assigned. CMS has awarded contracts to all 15 MAC
    jurisdictions; as a result of filed protests, CMS is taking
    corrective action regarding the contracts in several
    jurisdictions. While chain providers had the option of having
    all hospitals use one home office MAC, HCA chose to use the MACs
    assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are
    located. The individual MAC jurisdictions are in varying phases
    of transition. For the transition periods and for a potentially
    unforeseen period thereafter, all of these changes could impact
    claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow;
    however, we are unable to predict the impact at this time.

The MMA established the Recovery Audit Contractor
    (“RAC”) three-year demonstration program to conduct
    post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in
    the fee-for-service Medicare program. The Tax Relief and Health
    Care Act of 2006 made the RAC program permanent and mandated its
    nationwide expansion by 2010. CMS has awarded contracts to four
    RACs that are implementing the permanent RAC program on a
    nationwide basis.

Managed
    Medicare

Managed Medicare plans relate to situations where a private
    company contracts with CMS to provide members with Medicare
    Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed
    Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private
    fee-for-service plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries
    to choose enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. In 2003,
    MMA increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and
    expanded Medicare beneficiaries’ healthcare options. Since
    2003, the number of beneficiaries choosing to receive their
    Medicare benefits through such plans has increased. However, the
    Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008
    imposed new restrictions and implemented focused cuts to certain
    managed Medicare plans. In addition, some health care reform
    proposals would reduce payments to managed Medicare plans. In
    light of the current economic downturn and the political
    climate, managed Medicare plans may experience reduced premium
    payments, which may lead to decreased enrollment in such plans.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government
    and the states and are administered by states under approved
    plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
    or are based on negotiated



payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement
    is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The
    federal government and many states are currently considering
    altering the level of Medicaid funding (including upper payment
    limits) or program eligibility that could adversely affect
    future levels of Medicaid reimbursement received by our
    hospitals. As permitted by law, certain states in which we
    operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund their
    Medicaid programs.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current
    economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most
    states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely
    will continue to result in decreased spending for Medicaid
    programs in many states. Further, many states have also adopted,
    or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and
    program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care
    programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems.

Through DRA 2005, Congress has expanded the federal
    government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse
    in the Medicaid program by creating the Medicaid Integrity
    Program. Among other things, this legislation requires CMS to
    employ private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity
    Contractors (“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits
    of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned
    to five geographic regions and have commenced audits in several
    of the states assigned to those regions. Throughout 2010, MIC
    audits will continue to expand to other states. In addition to
    MICs, several other contractors, including the state Medicaid
    agencies, have increased their review activities. Future
    legislation or other changes in the administration or
    interpretation of government health programs could have a
    material, adverse effect on our financial position and results
    of operations.

Managed
    Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or
    more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims
    adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program
    responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core
    benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of
    the designated entities, usually a managed care organization.
    The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent
    years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid
    programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in
    which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to
    these plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program
    for members of the armed forces. On May 1, 2009, the
    Department of Defense implemented a prospective payment system
    for hospital outpatient services furnished to TRICARE
    beneficiaries similar to that utilized for services furnished to
    Medicare beneficiaries. Because the Medicare outpatient
    prospective payment system APC rates have historically been
    below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this payment methodology
    for TRICARE beneficiaries reduces our reimbursement; however,
    TRICARE outpatient services do not represent a significant
    portion of our patient volumes.

Annual
    Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
    TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
    under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
    requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
    require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
    revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
    provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
    recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
    adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us
    under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require
    several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to
    or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of
    appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
    cost reports.



Managed
    Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges
    to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
    including managed care plans and private insurance companies.
    Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other
    insurers were 34%, 35% and 37% of our total admissions for the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms
    between one and three years. While we generally received annual
    average yield increases of 6% to 7% from managed care payers
    during 2009, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    receive increases in the future.

Uninsured
    and Self-Pay Patients

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially
    admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended
    December 31, 2009, approximately 81% of our admissions of
    uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The
    Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
    the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment.

We are taking proactive measures to reduce our provision for
    doubtful accounts by, among other things:

•

screening all patients, including the uninsured, through our
    emergency screening protocol, to determine the appropriate care
    setting in light of their condition, while reducing the
    potential for bad debt; and

•

increasing up-front collections from patients subject to co-pay
    and deductible requirements and uninsured patients.

Hospital
    Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall
    utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of
    the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other
    health care professionals providing patient care within the
    facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be
    a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level
    of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for
    patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization
    include the growth in local population, local economic
    conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
    our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are
    subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in
    patient utilization during holiday



periods and increases in the cold weather months. The data set
    forth in this table includes only those facilities that are
    consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
    most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered
    by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of
    freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic centers (including
    facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which
    we operate has



increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals
    operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases,
    competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals.
    Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported government
    agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities
    that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes.
    Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals.
    In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that
    provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services
    which may not be available at most of our hospitals. We are
    facing increasing competition from physician-owned specialty
    hospitals and both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery
    centers for market share in high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas
    outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric
    hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals,
    including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
    competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local
    communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality
    of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians,
    skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals,
    location, breadth of services, technology offered and prices
    charged. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient
    services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
    for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for
    physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
    of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
    affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may at any
    time terminate their affiliation with a hospital we operate, our
    hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on
    the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other
    qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a
    hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it
    renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on
    the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality
    of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees.
    Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality
    facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and
    patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
    is our ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of
    group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct
    and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts
    from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition,
    employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to
    contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed
    care programs and discounts from established gross charges.
    Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group
    health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market
    reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services,
    quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success
    will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our
    managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts
    on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our
    ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate
    increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and
    conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate
    exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise
    restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with
    us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers
    tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures.
    The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care
    organizations varies from community to community, depending on
    the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
    limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
    services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
    make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
    restricting competition. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. Before issuing a
    CON, these states consider the need for additional or expanded
    health care facilities or services. In those states which have
    no CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures
    before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition
    in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is
    more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business —
    Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of
    continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
    rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
    medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
    and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider
    services by private and government payers remain ongoing
    challenges.



Admissions and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively
    affected by payer-required pre-admission authorization,
    utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and
    alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill
    patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer
    pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we
    intend to expand our facilities or acquire or construct new
    facilities where appropriate, to better enable the provision of
    a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market
    competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities
    and equipment, and offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation
    and Other Factors

Licensure,
    Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
    numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the
    adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
    policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
    prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
    environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
    assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
    for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care
    facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
    Each of our acute care hospitals are certified for participation
    in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are accredited by The
    Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or
    Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive
    reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility
    were to lose accreditation by The Joint Commission, the facility
    would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to
    increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from
    non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in
    substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state,
    local and independent review body regulations and standards. The
    requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are
    subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may
    become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities,
    equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for
    licensure also may include notification or approval in the event
    of the transfer or change of ownership. Failure to obtain the
    necessary state approval in these circumstances can result in
    the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership.

Certificates
    of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care
    facilities, the construction or expansion of health care
    facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer
    or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services
    may be subject to review by and prior approval of state
    regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally
    require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need
    for additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
    Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
    inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
    change ownership.

State
    Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
    review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
    assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
    within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have
    not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
    Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that
    mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we
    will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states
    in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating
    such reviews.

Federal
    Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
    and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
    the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
    hospital’s participation in the federal health care
    programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
    be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
    or both.



Anti-kickback
    Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
    “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
    from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
    paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
    or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care
    program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held
    that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just
    one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even
    if there are other lawful purposes. Violations of the
    Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up
    to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money
    penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to
    three times the total amount of the remuneration

and/or

exclusion from participation in federal health care programs,
    including Medicare and Medicaid.

The Office of Inspector General at HHS (“OIG”), among
    other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
    eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
    mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
    and inspections. As one means of providing guidance to health
    care providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
    These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
    of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may
    cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the
    Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG
    has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute
    suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive
    by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the
    hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted
    office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to
    the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly
    discounted billing, nursing or other staff services,
    (d) free training for a physician’s office staff in
    areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques,
    (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s
    income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will
    pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or
    interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a
    physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of
    the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for
    conferences, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group
    health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the
    physician, (i) payment for services (which may include
    consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any,
    substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods
    or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair
    market value, and (k) rental of space in physician offices,
    at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to
    which physicians refer. The OIG has encouraged persons having
    information about hospitals who offer the above types of
    incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of
    providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins,
    along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain
    arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities, including:
    (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
    venture arrangements between those in a position to refer
    business, such as physicians, and those providing items or
    services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and
    (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the
    practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
    hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
    the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory
    Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for
    certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance
    identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse
    statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include
    compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment
    arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships
    with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
    regulations that outline categories of activities deemed
    protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute.
    Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for
    various activities, including the following: certain investment
    interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner
    recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale
    of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts,
    employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary
    coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements,
    obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in
    group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance
    replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall
    within a safe harbor, or it is identified in a Special Fraud
    Alert or Advisory Bulletin or as a risk area in the Supplemental
    Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals, does



not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement
    illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct
    and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and
    others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to
    our hospitals and other health care facilities, including
    employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and
    professional service agreements. We also have similar
    relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients
    are referred from our facilities. In addition, we provide
    financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to
    recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals.
    While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors,
    certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures
    and financial relationships with physicians and other referral
    sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do
    not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other
    referral sources have been structured to comply with current law
    and available interpretations, there can be no assurance
    regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these
    financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or
    other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us
    to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including criminal
    penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
    participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care
    programs.

Stark
    Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
    as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prevents the entity
    from billing Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or
    services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the
    entity to refund amounts received for items or services provided
    pursuant to the prohibited referral. The law, thus, effectively
    prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid
    patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate
    family members have a financial relationship, if these entities
    provide certain “designated health services”
    reimbursable by Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient
    hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology
    services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial
    of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim
    submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs.
    The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a
    circumvention scheme. There are exceptions to the self-referral
    prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements
    between physicians and providers, including employment
    contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. There is also an
    exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire
    hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital
    department. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute
    with which compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply
    with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the
    arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law.

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final
    regulations implementing the Stark Law. Additional changes to
    these regulations, which became effective October 1, 2009,
    further restrict the types of arrangements facilities and
    physicians may enter, including additional restrictions on
    certain leases, percentage compensation arrangements, and
    agreements under which a hospital purchases services “under
    arrangements.” While these regulations were intended to
    clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it
    is unclear how the government will interpret many of these
    exceptions for enforcement purposes. CMS has indicated it is
    considering additional changes to the Stark Law regulations.
    Because many of these laws and their implementing regulations
    are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of
    significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
    and regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to
    meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
    implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we
    cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the
    Stark Law.

On September 14, 2007, CMS published an information
    collection request called the Disclosure of Financial Relations
    Report (“DFRR”). The DFRR and its supporting
    documentation are currently under review by the Office of
    Management and Budget, and it is unclear when, or if, it will be
    finalized. CMS has indicated that responding hospitals will have
    a limited amount of time to compile a significant amount of
    information relating to their financial relationships with
    physicians. A hospital may be subject to substantial penalties
    if it is unable to assemble and report this information within
    the required time frame or if any applicable government agency
    determines that



the submission is inaccurate or incomplete. Depending on the
    final format of the DFRR, responding hospitals may be subject to
    substantial penalties as a result of enforcement actions brought
    by government agencies and whistleblowers acting pursuant to the
    federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) and similar state
    laws, based on such allegations as failure to respond within
    required deadlines, that the response is inaccurate or contains
    incomplete information, or that the response indicates a
    potential violation of the Stark Law or other requirements.

Similar
    State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the
    Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for
    patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that
    prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws
    is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the source of
    payment for care, and little precedent exists for their
    interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide
    for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility
    licensure.

Other
    Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
    (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and
    abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care
    fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The
    Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties
    for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid.
    False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for
    services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
    rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
    unnecessary goods and services, and cost report fraud. Federal
    enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare
    and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees
    associated with business entities that have committed health
    care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no
    knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be
    imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including
    failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing
    arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in
    excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration
    to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection
    of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or
    entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program,
    making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or
    limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in
    return for referring an individual for an item or service
    payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback
    Statute, these provisions are very broad. To avoid liability,
    providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately
    code claims for reimbursement, as well as accurately prepare
    cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary
    Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud
    and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil
    monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and
    in some cases may result in penalties of up to three times the
    remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition,
    a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state
    health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly
    use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where
    they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof
    requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further,
    individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information
    on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at
    least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity
    Program.

The
    Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

The

qui tam

, or whistleblower, provisions of the FCA
    allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the
    government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal
    government. Further, the government may use the FCA to prosecute
    Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as
    coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting
    false cost reports. When a private party brings a

qui tam

action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the
    lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or
    makes a determination whether it will intervene. When a
    defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the
    FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual
    damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil
    penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false
    claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the
    FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a
    false claim for



reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the
    term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence
    will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a
    claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
    constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and,
    therefore, will qualify for liability. On May 20, 2009, the
    Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of
    the FCA by, among other things, creating liability for knowingly
    and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received
    from the government and broadening protections for
    whistleblowers.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have
    taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers
    who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the
    Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted
    false claims under the FCA. Every entity that receives at least
    $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written
    policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing
    detailed information about false claims, false statements and
    whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including
    the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law
    provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws
    comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate
    have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their
    own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may
    file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and
    distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state
    laws.

HIPAA
    Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security
    Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
    the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
    certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
    received electronically. These provisions are intended to
    encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
    has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
    Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
    is mandatory for our facilities. In addition, HIPAA requires
    that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. In
    January 2009, CMS published a final rule making changes to the
    formats used for certain electronic transactions and requiring
    the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and
    procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. While use of the ICD-10
    code sets is not mandatory until October 1, 2013, we will
    be modifying our payment systems and processes to prepare for
    the implementation. Implementing the ICD-10 code sets will
    require significant administrative changes, but we believe that
    the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is
    not expected to have a material, adverse effect on our business,
    financial position or results of operations.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to
    HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of
    individually identifiable health information and require covered
    entities, including health plans and most health care providers,
    to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards
    to protect the security of such information. The American
    Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”), which
    was signed into law on February 17, 2009, broadened the
    scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In
    addition, ARRA extends the application of certain provisions of
    the security and privacy regulations to business associates
    (entities that handle identifiable health information on behalf
    of covered entities) and subjects business associates to civil
    and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. We
    enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with
    HIPAA privacy and security requirements and under which a HIPAA
    compliance group monitors our compliance. The privacy
    regulations and security regulations have and will continue to
    impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply
    with these standards.

As required by ARRA, HHS published an interim final rule on
    August 24, 2009, that requires covered entities to report
    breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected
    individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed
    60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or
    its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in
    certain situations involving large breaches, to the media.
    Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify
    affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving
    individually identifiable information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may
    result in civil and criminal penalties, and ARRA has
    strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, which may
    result in increased enforcement activity. Under ARRA, HHS is
    required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered
    entities and their business associates. ARRA broadens the
    applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of
    covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for
    violations resulting from willful neglect. ARRA also
    significantly increases the amount of the civil penalties, with
    penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil
    penalty of



$1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same
    requirement. In addition, ARRA authorizes state attorneys
    general to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or
    damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security
    regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Our
    facilities also remain subject to any federal or state
    privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy
    regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose
    additional penalties.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory
    initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy
    and security concerns. For example, the Federal Trade Commission
    issued a final rule in October 2007 requiring financial
    institutions and creditors, which may include health providers
    and health plans, to implement written identity theft prevention
    programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in
    connection with certain accounts. The Federal Trade Commission
    has delayed enforcement of this rule until June 1, 2010.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA.
    This federal law requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every individual who presents to the
    hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the
    individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to
    either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer
    of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition.
    The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical
    conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to
    pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a
    hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer
    an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
    order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
    pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary
    penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare
    program. In addition, an injured individual, the
    individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a
    financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation
    of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
    which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s
    emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
    treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
    hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
    or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
    certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law
    also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a
    patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned
    ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals
    admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed
    its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively
    in the future. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial
    compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate
    Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting
    corporations and other entities from employing physicians,
    practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and
    indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health
    care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of
    patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for
    medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation
    of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and
    criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the
    corporation and the physician may be considered void and
    unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are
    often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or
    regulatory agencies.

Health
    Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
    years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention,
    changes in government personnel or other factors may lead to
    increased scrutiny of the health care industry. While we are
    currently not aware of any material investigations of the
    Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations,
    it is possible that governmental entities could initiate
    investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we
    operate and that such matters could result in significant
    penalties, as well as adverse



publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers
    could be included in governmental investigations or litigation
    or named as defendants in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental
    billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We
    continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have
    developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is
    designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and
    constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation
    may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or
    industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations,
    governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
    issues, including some for which little official interpretation
    previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent
    with practices that have been common within the industry and
    that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some
    instances, government investigations that have in the past been
    conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be
    conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their
    focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement
    efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of
    Justice have, from time to time, established national
    enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that
    focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of
    abuse. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such
    as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal
    intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health
    care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
    audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and
    state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine
    health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing
    practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial
    arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment
    activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and
    collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of
    these routine health care operations and other activities that
    could be the subject of governmental investigations or
    inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and
    Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with
    physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint
    venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of
    our individual facilities have received, and other facilities
    may receive, government inquiries from federal and state
    agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our
    executives or managers could result in significant liabilities
    or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.

Commencing in 1997, we became aware we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. As part of the investigations, the United
    States intervened in a number of

qui tam

actions brought
    by private parties. The investigations related to, among other
    things, DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing, home health
    issues, physician relations, cost report and wound care issues.
    The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements
    executed in 2000 and 2003 with the Criminal Division of the
    Department of Justice, the Civil Division of the Department of
    Justice, various U.S. Attorneys’ offices, CMS, a
    negotiating team representing states with claims against us, and
    others. In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year Corporate
    Integrity Act (“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector
    General of the Department of Health and Human Services, which
    expired January 24, 2009. If the government were to
    determine that we violated or breached the CIA or other federal
    or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar
    programs, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines,
    civil and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs and other federal and state health care programs.
    Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or through
    private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed against us as
    a result of such actions could have a material, adverse effect
    on our results of operations and financial position.

Health
    Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in the United
    States and continues to attract much legislative interest and
    public attention. National health care reform is a focus at the
    federal level. In the final months of 2009, both houses of the
    U.S. Congress passed separate bills intended to reform the
    health care system through, among other things, decreasing the
    number of uninsured individuals and reducing health care costs.
    While neither of these bills has yet become law, such laws or
    similar proposals have been, and we anticipate will continue to
    be, a focus at the federal level. Several states are also
    considering health care reform measures. This focus on health
    care



reform may increase the likelihood of significant changes
    affecting the health care industry. In addition, possible future
    changes in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs,
    including Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to upper
    payment limit programs, may impact reimbursements to health care
    providers and insurers. Many states have enacted, or are
    considering enacting, measures designed to reduce their Medicaid
    expenditures and change private health care insurance. States
    have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to
    reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll Medicaid
    recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    states’ Medicaid systems. Some states, including the states
    in which we operate, have applied for and have been granted
    federal waivers from current Medicaid regulations to allow them
    to serve some or all of their Medicaid participants through
    managed care providers. Hospital operating margins have been,
    and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of
    deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and growth
    in operating expenses in excess of the increase in PPS payments
    under the Medicare program.

General
    Economic and Demographic Factors

The United States economy has weakened significantly. Depressed
    consumer spending and higher unemployment rates continue to
    pressure many industries. During economic downturns,
    governmental entities often experience budget deficits as a
    result of increased costs and lower than expected tax
    collections. These budget deficits may force federal, state and
    local government entities to decrease spending for health and
    human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar
    programs, which represent significant payer sources for our
    hospitals. Other risks we face from general economic weakness
    include potential declines in the population covered under
    managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel
    elective and non-emergency health care procedures, potential
    increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and
    further difficulties in our collecting patient co-payment and
    deductible receivables.

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United
    States financial pressures. The federal deficit, the growing
    magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United
    States population will continue to place pressure on federal
    health care programs.

Compliance
    Program and Corporate Integrity Agreement

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
    is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
    awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
    emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
    regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we
    provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees
    and encourage all employees to report any violations to their
    supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
    telephone ethics line.

Until January 24, 2009, we operated under a Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (“CIA”), which was structured to
    assure the federal government of our overall federal health care
    program compliance and specifically covered DRG coding,
    outpatient PPS billing and physician relations. We underwent
    major training efforts to ensure that our employees learned and
    applied the policies and procedures implemented under the CIA
    and our ethics and compliance program. The CIA had the effect of
    increasing the amount of information we provided to the federal
    government regarding our health care practices and our
    compliance with federal regulations. Under the CIA, we had
    numerous affirmative obligations, including the requirement to
    report potential violations of applicable federal health care
    laws and regulations. Pursuant to this obligation, we reported a
    number of potential violations of the Stark Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, EMTALA, HIPAA and other laws, most of
    which we consider to be nonviolations or technical violations.
    We submitted our final report pursuant to the CIA on
    April 30, 2009. These reports could result in greater
    scrutiny by regulatory authorities. The government could
    determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues was inadequate. A determination
    that we breached the CIA

and/or

a
    finding of violations of applicable health care laws or
    regulations could subject us to repayment requirements,
    substantial monetary penalties, civil penalties, exclusion from
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties. Although the CIA expired on
    January 24, 2009, we maintain our ethics and compliance
    program in substantially the same form. However, the audit plans
    in the CIA have been modified and the reportable events process
    has been converted to an internal reporting process.



Antitrust
    Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
    laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
    anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
    refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
    tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
    practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
    competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can
    result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
    penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
    currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe
    we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but
    future review of our practices by courts or regulatory
    authorities could result in a determination that could adversely
    affect our operations.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
    ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment. We do not believe that we will be required to
    expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws
    and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to
    claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
    business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has
    obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally
    above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We
    also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
    our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for
    directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we
    believe are adequate. The directors and officers liability
    coverage includes a $25 million corporate deductible for
    the period prior to the Recapitalization and a $1 million
    corporate deductible subsequent to the Recapitalization. In
    addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our
    directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property
    coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of
    the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per
    claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood
    and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees
    and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    190,000 employees, including approximately
    49,000 part-time employees. References herein to
    “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We
    are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate
    wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating
    to employment. At December 31, 2009, employees at 20 of our
    hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is
    possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We
    consider our employee relations to be good and have not
    experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely
    affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals,
    like most hospitals, have experienced labor costs rising faster
    than the general inflation rate. In some markets, nurse and
    medical support personnel availability has become a significant
    operating issue to health care providers. To address this
    challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve
    retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, who generally
    are not employees of our hospitals. However, some physicians
    provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which
    generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the
    duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
    maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation
    for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be
    accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the
    hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
    board of the hospital, in accordance with established
    credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff.
    Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve
    on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their
    affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.



We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to
    recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or
    to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a
    result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the
    available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in
    each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed
    changes in federal labor laws, including the Employee Free
    Choice Act, could increase the likelihood of employee
    unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of
    our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase
    materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could
    adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory
    nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated
    nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs,
    and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to
    limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors
    were to occur, our business, financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
    adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also
    constrain our business and operations.

Our
    Substantial Leverage Could Adversely Affect Our Ability To Raise
    Additional Capital To Fund Our Operations, Limit Our
    Ability To React To Changes In The Economy Or Our Industry,
    Expose Us To Interest Rate Risk To The Extent Of Our Variable
    Rate Debt And Prevent Us From Meeting Our Obligations.

We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2009, our total
    indebtedness was $25.670 billion. Our high degree of
    leverage could have important consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in
    general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse
    changes in government regulations;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;



•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing
    us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product or service line
    development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general
    corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who are less highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions
    contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the
    indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness
    is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we
    now face could intensify.

We May
    Not Be Able To Generate Sufficient Cash To Service All Of Our
    Indebtedness And May Not Be Able To Refinance Our Indebtedness
    On Favorable Terms. If We Are Unable To Do So, We May Be Forced
    To Take Other Actions To Satisfy Our Obligations Under Our
    Indebtedness, Which May Not Be Successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
    operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic
    and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business
    and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we
    will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
    sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
    and interest on our indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2009, our substantial indebtedness
    included $9.702 billion of indebtedness under our senior
    secured credit facilities maturing in 2012 and 2013,
    $2.750 billion aggregate principal amount of first lien
    notes maturing in 2019 and 2020, $6.088 billion aggregate
    principal amount of second lien notes maturing in 2014, 2016 and
    2017 and $6.856 billion aggregate principal amount of
    unsecured senior notes and debentures that mature on various
    dates from 2010 to 2095 (including $5.454 billion maturing
    through 2016). Because a significant portion of our indebtedness
    matures in the next few years, we may find it necessary or
    prudent to refinance that indebtedness with longer-maturity debt
    at a higher interest rate. In February, April and August of
    2009, for example, we issued $310 million in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    second lien notes due 2017, $1.500 billion in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    first lien notes due 2019 and $1.250 billion in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    first lien notes due 2020, respectively. We used the net
    proceeds of those offerings to prepay term loans under our cash
    flow credit facility, which currently bears interest at a lower
    floating rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on
    favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the current
    global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our
    ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally
    enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of
    unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our
    assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash
    flows and results of operations, and on economic and market
    conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our
    indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments
    and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional
    capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and
    available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service
    obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
    might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to
    meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able
    to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the
    dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service
    obligations then due.

Our Debt
    Agreements Contain Restrictions That Limit Our Flexibility In
    Operating Our Business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
    governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that
    limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.
    These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’
    ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;



•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for
    as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based
    revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving
    credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain
    period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default
    has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our
    depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a
    blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to
    prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and
    to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to
    satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to
    meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our
    control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet
    those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in
    a default under both our cash flow credit facility and our
    asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an
    event of default under our senior secured credit facilities, our
    lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our
    senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and
    payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.
    If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our
    senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the
    collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have
    pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under
    our senior secured credit facilities, and that collateral (other
    than certain European collateral securing our senior secured
    European term loan facility) is also pledged as collateral under
    our outstanding notes. If any of the lenders under our senior
    secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of
    borrowings, there can be no assurance we will have sufficient
    assets to repay our senior secured credit facilities or our
    outstanding notes.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other Hospitals And
    Health Care Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition
    among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
    intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
    local communities we serve provide services similar to those
    offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on a
    website performance data related to quality measures and data on
    patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with
    their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for the
    future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be
    reported. Additional quality measures and future trends toward
    clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our
    competitive position and patient volumes. If any of our
    hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than
    our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient
    satisfaction surveys, patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals,
    surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the
    geographic areas in which we operate has increased
    significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
    highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that
    compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or

not-for-profit

corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on
    a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals are facing increasing
    competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and from
    both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for
    market share in high margin services and for quality physicians
    and personnel. If ambulatory surgery centers are better able to
    compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals
    may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may
    experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our
    ambulatory surgery centers. In states that do not require a CON
    for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care
    facilities or services, competition in the form of new services,
    facilities and capital spending is more prevalent.



Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients,
    recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed
    care contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and
    ambulatory surgery centers, we may experience an overall decline
    in patient volume. See Item 1, “Business —
    Competition.”

The
    Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A Deterioration
    In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could Adversely Affect
    Our Results Of Operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate
    to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which
    the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by
    the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly
    from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal and state governmental and private employer
    health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient
    admissions and other collection indicators. Due to a number of
    factors, including the recent economic downturn and increase in
    unemployment, we believe our facilities may experience growth in
    bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care. At
    December 31, 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 94% of the $5.176 billion patient
    due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for
    doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care
    increased from $6.134 billion for 2007, to
    $7.009 billion for 2008 and to $8.362 billion for 2009.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
    proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
    accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these
    accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Health
    Care Reform And Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our
    Revenues.

National health care reform remains a focus at the federal
    level. In the final months of 2009, both houses of the
    U.S. Congress passed separate bills intended to reform the
    health care system through, among other things, decreasing the
    number of uninsured individuals and reducing health care costs.
    While neither of these bills has yet become law, such laws or
    similar proposals have been, and we anticipate will continue to
    be, a focus at the federal level. Several states are also
    considering health care reform measures. Federal or state health
    care reform could adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

The focus on health care reform may also increase the likelihood
    of significant changes affecting existing government health care
    programs. A significant portion of our patient volumes is
    derived from government health care programs, principally
    Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to
    frequent and substantial changes. We derived approximately 60%
    of our admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in
    2009. In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have
    resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in
    levels of payments to health care providers for certain services
    under these government programs. Possible future changes in the
    Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs may reduce
    reimbursements to health care providers and insurers and may
    also increase our operating costs, which could reduce our
    profitability.

Effective January 1, 2008, CMS increased ASC payment groups
    from nine clinically disparate payment groups to an extensive
    list of covered surgical procedures among the APCs used under
    the outpatient PPS for these surgical services. CMS established
    a four-year transition period for implementing the revised
    payment rates and significantly expanded the number of
    procedures that Medicare reimburses if performed in an ASC. CMS
    also limited ASC reimbursement for procedures commonly performed
    in physicians’ offices. More Medicare procedures now
    performed in hospitals, such as ours, may be moved to ASCs,
    reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare
    procedures now performed in ASCs, such as ours, may be moved to
    physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may
    adopt similar policies.

CMS has recently completed a two-year transition to full
    implementation of the MS-DRGs system, which represents a
    refinement to the existing MS-DRG system. Realignments in the
    DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain
    services. For federal fiscal year 2010, CMS has provided a 2.1%
    market basket update for hospitals that submit certain quality
    patient care indicators and a 0.1% update for hospitals that do
    not



submit this data. While we will endeavor to comply with all
    quality data submission requirements, our submissions may not be
    deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market
    basket adjustment for all of our hospitals. Medicare payments to
    hospitals in federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 were reduced to
    eliminate what CMS estimated to be the effect of coding or
    classifications changes as a result of hospitals implementing
    the MS-DRG system. If CMS retrospectively determines the
    adjustment levels for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 were
    inadequate, CMS may impose additional adjustments in future
    years. Although CMS has not imposed an adjustment for federal
    fiscal year 2010, CMS has announced its intent to impose payment
    adjustments in federal fiscal years 2011 and 2012 because of
    what CMS has determined to be an inadequate adjustment in
    federal fiscal year 2008. Additionally, Medicare payments to
    hospitals are subject to a number of other adjustments, and the
    actual impact on payments to specific hospitals may vary. In
    some cases, commercial third-party payers and other payers such
    as some state Medicaid programs rely on all or portions of the
    Medicare MS-DRG system to determine payment rates, and
    adjustments that negatively impact Medicare payments may also
    negatively impact payments from those payers.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current
    economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most
    states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and likely
    will continue to result, in decreased spending for Medicaid
    programs in many states. Further, many states have also adopted,
    or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and
    program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care
    programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems.

On May 1, 2009, the Department of Defense implemented a
    prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services
    furnished to TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for
    services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the
    Medicare outpatient prospective payment system APC rates have
    historically been below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this
    payment methodology for TRICARE beneficiaries reduces our
    reimbursement; however, TRICARE outpatient services do not
    represent a significant portion of our patient volumes.

Changes in laws or regulations regarding government health
    programs or other changes in the administration of government
    health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

If We Are
    Unable To Retain And Negotiate Favorable Contracts With
    Nongovernment Payers, Including Managed Care Plans, Our Revenues
    May Be Reduced.

Our ability to obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment
    payers, including health maintenance organizations, preferred
    provider organizations and other managed care plans
    significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our
    facilities. Revenues derived from these entities and other
    insurers accounted for 52% and 53% of our patient revenues for
    the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008, respectively. Nongovernment payers, including managed care
    payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the
    trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to
    increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Our future
    success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew
    our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care
    contracts on terms favorable to us. Other health care providers
    may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or
    negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable
    terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may
    negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or
    otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to
    contract with us. If we are unable to retain and negotiate
    favorable contracts with managed care plans or experience
    reductions in payment increases or amounts received from
    nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our
    Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain Quality
    Physicians.

The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and
    quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our
    hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and
    maintaining good relations with those physicians. Although we
    employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of
    the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets
    we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other
    hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may
    terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If
    we are unable to provide



adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment
    and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians,
    they may be discouraged from referring patients to our
    facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating
    performance may decline.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May Increase
    Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and
    experience of our management and medical support personnel, such
    as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our
    physicians. We compete with other health care providers in
    recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
    personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
    hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
    professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
    other medical support personnel has been a significant operating
    issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue
    to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and
    other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive
    temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs
    could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of
    semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in
    which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor
    laws, including the Employee Free Choice Act, could increase the
    likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a
    significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is
    possible our labor costs could increase materially. In addition,
    the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory
    nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing
    ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios
    could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse
    impact on revenue if we are required to limit admissions in
    order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase,
    we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased
    costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists
    of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along
    increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and
    retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support
    personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

If We
    Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government Regulations,
    We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make Significant
    Changes To Our Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
    and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local
    government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing and coding for services;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•

adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and
    security issues associated with health-related and personal
    information and medical records;

•

the screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who
    have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and certification;

•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

preparing and filing of cost reports;

•

operating policies and procedures; and

•

addition of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the
    federal physician self-referral law (commonly called the Stark
    Law), the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of
    financial relationships with physicians and others who either
    refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals and
    other health care facilities, and these laws govern those
    relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that
    outline practices deemed



protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute.
    While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors,
    certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures
    and financial relationships with physicians and other referral
    sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do
    not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a
    safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates
    the Anti-kickback Statute, but may subject the arrangement to
    greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that
    practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate
    the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the
    Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof
    than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback
    Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their
    immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by
    meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships
    to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
    implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we
    cannot provide assurance every relationship complies fully with
    the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet
    an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the
    Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark
    Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found
    to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the
    government or by a private person under a

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suit.

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
    Law, the FCA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could
    be subjected to liabilities, including civil penalties
    (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more
    facilities), exclusion of one or more facilities from
    participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties. See “Regulation.”

CMS published a proposal to collect information from 400
    hospitals regarding their ownership, investment and compensation
    arrangements with physicians. Called the Disclosure of Financial
    Relationships Report (or “DFRR”), CMS intends to use
    this data to monitor compliance with the Stark Law, and CMS may
    share this information with other government agencies. Many of
    these agencies have not previously analyzed this information and
    have the authority to bring enforcement actions against
    hospitals filing such reports. The DFRR and its supporting
    documentation are currently under review by the Office of
    Management and Budget, and it is unclear when, or if, it will be
    finalized.

Because many of these laws and their implementing regulations
    are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of
    significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
    and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
    enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our
    current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
    illegality or could require us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure
    programs and operating expenses. A determination we have
    violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are
    being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could
    have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business
    reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other
    legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be
    adopted that adversely affect our business.

We Have
    Been And Could Be The Subject Of Governmental Investigations,
    Claims And Litigation.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal FCA,
    private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit
    false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments
    from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state
    whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our
    individual facilities have received, and other facilities may
    receive, government inquiries from federal and state agencies.
    Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future
    inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their
    resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare
    Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers,
    as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct
    audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct
    similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits
    and



monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such
    audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered
    systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material,
    adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
    and liquidity.

The MMA established the RAC three-year demonstration program to
    conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper
    payments in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006
    made the RAC program permanent and mandated its nationwide
    expansion by 2010. CMS has awarded contracts to four RACs that
    are implementing the permanent RAC program on a nationwide
    basis. In addition, CMS employs MICs to perform post-payment
    audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. Throughout
    2010, MIC audits will continue to expand. In addition to MICs,
    several other contractors, including the state Medicaid
    agencies, have increased their review activities.

Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws,
    regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the
    findings, our business, our financial position and our results
    of operations could be negatively impacted.

Controls
    Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our
    Revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to
    reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
    “utilization review,” have affected and are expected
    to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails
    the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient
    by health plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay
    and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by
    payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review
    and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
    health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
    Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to
    continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these
    changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the
    scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees
    could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations.

Our
    Overall Business Results May Suffer From The Recent Economic
    Downturn.

The United States economy has weakened significantly. Depressed
    consumer spending and higher unemployment rates continue to
    pressure many industries. During economic downturns,
    governmental entities often experience budget deficits as a
    result of increased costs and lower than expected tax
    collections. These budget deficits may force federal, state and
    local government entities to decrease spending for health and
    human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar
    programs, which represent significant payer sources for our
    hospitals. Other risks we face from general economic weakness
    include potential declines in the population covered under
    managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel
    elective and non-emergency health care procedures, potential
    increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and
    further difficulties in our collecting patient co-payment and
    deductible receivables.

The
    Industry Trend Towards Value-Based Purchasing May Negatively
    Impact Our Revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based
    purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing
    programs include both public reporting of quality data and
    preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of
    care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including
    Medicare and Medicaid require hospitals to report certain
    quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition,
    Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain
    preventable adverse events (also called “never
    events”). Many large commercial payers currently require
    hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers
    do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse
    events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which
    we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or
    expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events. We
    expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that
    condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become
    more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement
    amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend
    will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively
    impact our revenues.



Our
    Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our Information
    Systems.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or
    delay the collection of revenues. Even though we have
    implemented network security measures, our servers are
    vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar
    disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any
    of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss
    or corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of
    systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on
    our financial position and results of operations and harm our
    business reputation.

The performance of our information technology and systems is
    critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared
    services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a
    number of critical areas of our operations, including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management;

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts
    and supply contracts; and

•

monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality
    measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.

If We
    Fail To Effectively And Timely Implement Electronic Health
    Record Systems, Our Operations Could Be Adversely
    Affected.

As required by ARRA, HHS is in the process of developing and
    implementing an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals
    and health care professionals that adopt and meaningfully use
    certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology.
    If our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet
    the requirements for participation in the incentive payment
    program, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments
    that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems.
    Further, beginning in 2015, eligible hospitals and professionals
    that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR
    technology will be subject to reduced payments from Medicare.
    Failure to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely
    manner could have a material, adverse effect on our financial
    position and results of operations.

State
    Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of Health Care
    Facilities Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our
    Operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country,
    require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as
    a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health
    care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make
    changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these
    states consider the need for additional or expanded health care
    facilities or services. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. The failure to
    obtain any requested CON could impair our ability to operate or
    expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely
    affect our ability to attract patients to our facilities and
    grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas, Which
    Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental And
    Competitive Conditions And Changes In Those States.

We operated 163 hospitals at December 31, 2009, and 73 of
    those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida
    and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented
    approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2009. This concentration makes us
    particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic,



environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those
    states. Any material change in the current payment programs or
    regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in
    those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall
    business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida and Texas and other areas
    across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In
    the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the
    operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal
    states, and the patient populations in those states. Our
    business activities could be harmed by a particularly active
    hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property
    insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from
    future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The Internal Revenue
    Service.

At December 31, 2009, we were contesting before the Appeals
    Division of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS
    in connection with its examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal
    income tax returns for HCA and eight affiliates that are treated
    as partnerships for federal income tax purposes
    (“affiliated partnerships”). The disputed items
    include the timing of recognition of certain patient service
    revenues and our method for calculating the tax allowance for
    doubtful accounts.

Six taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1997
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year of four affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are
    pending before the IRS Examination Division as of
    December 31, 2009.

The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and seven affiliated partnerships during 2008.
    We anticipate the IRS Examination Division will conclude its
    audit in 2010. During 2009, the seven affiliated partnership
    audits were resolved with no material impact on our operations
    or financial position. We anticipate the IRS will begin an audit
    of the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns for HCA during
    2010.

Management believes HCA, its predecessors and affiliates
    properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance
    with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and
    final resolution of these disputes will not have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of
    these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions
    could have a material, adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against Our
    Facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices,
    including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
    ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
    liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims
    and significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our
    professional liability risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary.
    Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and
    insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims
    arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance
    contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance
    contracts are included in its reserves for professional
    liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
    that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
    reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially
    determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or
    reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results
    of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

We Are
    Exposed To Market Risks Related To Changes In The Market Values
    Of Securities And Interest Rate Changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.309 billion and $7 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $20 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets.



Should the wholly-owned insurance subsidiary require significant
    amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay
    claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have
    difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be
    forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise
    have been able to in a normal market environment. At
    December 31, 2009, our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
    had invested $396 million ($401 million par value) in
    municipal, tax-exempt student loan auction rate securities
    (“ARS”) that continued to experience market
    illiquidity since February 2008 when multiple failed auctions
    occurred due to a severe credit and liquidity crisis in the
    capital markets. It is uncertain if auction-related market
    liquidity will resume for these securities. We may be required
    to recognize

other-than-temporary

impairments on these investments in future periods should
    issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market
    valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings
    downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations.
    Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed
    and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based
    on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The net
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. See Item 7, “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Market Risk.”

Since The
    Recapitalization, The Investors Control Us And May Have
    Conflicts Of Interest With Us In The Future.

As of December 31, 2009, the Investors indirectly owned
    approximately 97.1% of our capital stock due to the
    Recapitalization. As a result, the Investors have control over
    our decisions to enter into any significant corporate
    transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that
    requires the approval of shareholders. For example, the
    Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the
    amount of our indebtedness or sell assets.

Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making
    investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
    businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or
    more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities
    that may be complementary to our business and, as a result,
    those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So
    long as investment funds associated with or designated by the
    Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the
    outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is
    less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly
    influence or effectively control our decisions.

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we
    directly or indirectly operate 105 freestanding surgery centers.
    We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with
    some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
    occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Fourteen
    of our general, acute care hospitals and three of our other
    properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under
    our senior secured cash flow credit facility and the first lien
    secured notes we issued in 2009. These three other properties
    are also subject to second mortgages to support our obligations
    under the second lien secured notes we issued in 2006 and 2009.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately
    1,200,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
    area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain
    regional service centers related to our shared services
    initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
    which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
    suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
    for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various
    federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating
    their operation. Management does not believe that compliance
    with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our
    financial position or results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could materially and
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    position in a given period.



Government
    Investigations, Claims and Litigation

In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG,
    which expired on January 24, 2009. Under the CIA, we had
    numerous affirmative obligations, including the requirement to
    report potential violations of applicable federal health care
    laws and regulations. Pursuant to these obligations, we reported
    a number of potential violations of the Stark Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, EMTALA and other laws, most of which we
    consider to be nonviolations or technical violations. We
    submitted our final report pursuant to the CIA on April 30,
    2009. The government could determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues was inadequate. Violation or
    breach of the CIA, or violation of federal or state laws
    relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, could
    subject us to substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal
    penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs. Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or
    through private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed
    against us as a result of such actions could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Merger
    Litigation in State Court

In 2006, the Foundation for Seacoast Health filed suit against
    HCA in state court in New Hampshire. The Foundation alleged that
    both the 2006 Recapitalization transaction and a prior 1999
    intra-corporate transaction violated a 1983 agreement that
    placed certain restrictions on transfers of the Portsmouth
    Regional Hospital. In May 2007, the trial court ruled against
    the Foundation on all its claims. On appeal, the
    New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed the ruling on the
    Recapitalization, but remanded to the trial court the claims
    based on the 1999 intra-corporate transaction. The trial court
    ruled in December 2009 that the 1999 intra-corporate transaction
    breached the transfer restriction provisions of the 1983
    agreement. The trial court will now conduct further proceedings
    to determine whether any harm has flowed from the alleged
    breach, and if so, what the appropriate remedy should be,
    including determining whether, pursuant to the Foundation’s
    assertion, that it should have the right to purchase the
    hospital.

General
    Liability and Other Claims

We are a party to certain proceedings relating to claims for
    income taxes and related interest before the IRS Appeals
    Division. For a description of those proceedings, see
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
    Pending IRS Disputes” and Note 5 to our consolidated
    financial statements.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
    physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
    the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which
    may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management,
    the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
    proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
    the fourth quarter of 2009.



PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our outstanding common stock is privately held, and there is no
    established public trading market for our common stock. As of
    February 28, 2010, there were 625 holders of our common
    stock. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations
    — Liquidity and Capital Resources —
    Financing Activities” for a description of the restrictions
    on our ability to pay dividends. We did not pay any dividends in
    2007, 2008 or 2009.

On January 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    vested stock options. The distribution was $17.50 per share and
    vested stock option, or approximately $1.750 billion in the
    aggregate. The distribution was paid on February 5, 2010 to
    holders of record on February 1, 2010. The distribution was
    funded using funds available under our existing senior secured
    credit facilities and approximately $100 million of cash on
    hand. Pursuant to the terms of our stock option plans, the
    holders of nonvested stock options received a $17.50 per share
    reduction to the exercise price of their share-based awards.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, HCA issued and
    sold 4,284 shares of common stock in connection with the
    cashless exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration
    of $54,621 resulting in 2,691 net settled shares. HCA also
    issued and sold 19,641 shares of common stock in connection
    with the cash exercise of stock options for aggregate
    consideration of $250,423. The shares were issued without
    registration in reliance on the exemptions afforded by
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.

On April 29, 2008, we registered our common stock pursuant
    to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended.

The following table provides certain information with respect to
    our repurchase of common stock from October 1, 2009 through

    expansion of our business and improvements to our existing
    facilities, (13) changes in accounting practices,
    (14) changes in general economic conditions nationally and
    regionally in our markets, (15) future divestitures which
    may result in charges, (16) changes in business strategy or
    development plans, (17) delays in receiving payments for
    services provided, (18) the outcome of pending and any
    future tax audits, appeals and litigation associated with our
    tax positions, (19) potential liabilities and other claims
    that may be asserted against us, and (20) other risk
    factors described in this annual report on

HCA
    INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

    Operations Summary (Continued)

Revenues increased to $30.052 billion for 2009 from
    $28.374 billion for 2008. Revenues increased 5.9% on a
    consolidated basis and 6.1% on a same facility basis for 2009,
    compared to 2008. The consolidated revenues increase can be
    attributed to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 3.2% increase in equivalent
    admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from a
    2.6% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission
    and a 3.4% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

During 2009, consolidated admissions increased 1.0% and same
    facility admissions increased 1.2%, compared to 2008. Inpatient
    surgical volumes increased 0.3% on a consolidated basis and
    increased 0.5% on a same facility basis during 2009, compared to
    2008. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.4% on a
    consolidated basis and declined 0.1% on a same facility basis
    during 2009, compared to 2008. Emergency department visits
    increased 6.6% on a consolidated basis and increased 7.0% on a
    same facility basis during 2009, compared to 2008.

For 2009, the provision for doubtful accounts declined to 10.9%
    of revenues from 12.0% of revenues for 2008. The combined
    self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured
    discounts increased $1.486 billion for 2009, compared to
    2008. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured
    discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of net
    revenues, uninsured discounts and charity care, was 23.8% for
    2009, compared to 21.9% for 2008. Same facility uninsured
    admissions increased 4.7% and same facility uninsured emergency
    room visits increased 6.5% for 2009, compared to 2008.

Interest expense totaled $1.987 billion for 2009, compared
    to $2.021 billion for 2008. The $34 million decline in
    interest expense for 2009 was due to a reduction in the average
    debt balance offsetting an increase in the average interest rate.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

Maintain Our Dedication to the Care and Improvement of Human
    Life.

Our business is built on putting patients
    first and providing high quality health care services in the
    communities we serve. Our dedicated professionals oversee our
    Quality Review System, which measures clinical outcomes,
    satisfaction and regulatory compliance, to improve hospital
    quality and performance. We are implementing hospitalist
    programs in some facilities, evidence-based medicine programs
    and infection reduction initiatives. In addition, we continue to
    implement health information technology to improve the quality
    and convenience of services to our communities. We are using our
    electronic medication administration record, which uses bar
    coding technology to ensure that each patient receives the right
    medication, to build toward a fully electronic health record
    that will provide convenient access, electronic order entry and
    decision support for physicians. These technologies improve
    patient safety, quality and efficiency.

Maintain Our Commitment to Ethics and
    Compliance.

We are committed to a corporate
    culture highlighted by the following values —
    compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness, loyalty, respect and
    kindness. Our comprehensive ethics and compliance program
    reinforces our dedication to these values.

Leverage Our Leading Local Market
    Positions.

We strive to maintain and enhance the
    leading positions we enjoy in the majority of our markets. We
    believe the broad geographic presence of our facilities across a
    range of markets, in combination with the breadth and quality of
    services provided by our facilities, increases our
    attractiveness to patients and large employers and positions us
    to negotiate more favorable terms from commercial payers and
    increase the number of payers with whom we contract. We also
    intend to strategically enhance our outpatient presence in our
    communities to attract more patients to our facilities.



HCA
    INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Business
    Strategy (Continued)

Expand Our Presence in Key Markets.

We seek to
    grow our business in key markets, focusing on large, high growth
    urban and suburban communities, primarily in the southern and
    western regions of the United States. We seek to strategically
    invest in new and expanded services at our existing hospitals
    and surgery centers to increase our revenues at those facilities
    and provide the benefits of medical technology advances to our
    communities. We intend to continue to expand high volume and
    high margin specialty services, such as cardiology and
    orthopedic services, and increase the capacity, scope and
    convenience of our outpatient facilities. To complement this
    intrinsic growth, we intend to continue to opportunistically
    develop and acquire new hospitals and outpatient facilities.

Continue to Leverage Our Scale.

We will
    continue to seek price efficiencies through our group purchasing
    organization and build on the cost savings and efficiencies in
    billing, collection and other processes we have achieved through
    our regional service centers. We are increasingly taking
    advantage of our national scale by contracting for services on a
    multistate basis. We are expanding our successful shared
    services model for additional clinical and support functions,
    such as physician credentialing, medical transcription,
    electronic medical recordkeeping and health information
    management, across multiple markets.

Continue to Develop Physician
    Relationships.

We depend on the quality and
    dedication of the physicians who practice at our facilities, and
    we encourage, consistent with applicable laws, both primary care
    physicians and specialists to join our medical staffs. We
    sometimes assist physicians who are recruited under applicable
    regulatory provisions with establishing and building a practice
    or joining an existing practice. As part of our comprehensive
    approach to physician integration in our markets, we will
    continue to:

•

expand the number of high quality specialty services, such as
    cardiology, orthopedics, oncology and neonatology;

•

use joint ventures with physicians to further develop our
    outpatient business, particularly through ambulatory surgery
    centers;

•

develop medical office buildings to provide convenient
    facilities for physicians to locate their practices and serve
    their patients;

•

focus on improving the quality, advanced technology,
    infrastructure and performance of our facilities; and

•

employ physicians as appropriate.

Become the Health Care Employer of Choice.

We
    will continue to use a number of industry-leading practices to
    help ensure our hospitals are a health care employer of choice
    in their respective communities. Our staffing initiatives for
    both care providers and hospital management provide strategies
    for recruitment, compensation and productivity to increase
    employee retention and operating efficiency at our hospitals.
    For example, we maintain an internal contract nursing agency to
    supply our hospitals with high quality staffing at a lower cost
    than external agencies. In addition, we have developed several
    proprietary training and career development programs for our
    physicians and hospital administrators, including an executive
    development program designed to train the next generation of
    hospital leadership. We believe our continued investment in the
    training and retention of employees improves the quality of
    care, enhances operational efficiency and fosters our reputation
    as an employer of choice.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and various other assumptions we believe are
    reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on
    an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related
    disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes
    known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.



HCA
    INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
    are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
    Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
    plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
    contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to
    interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on
    a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best
    information available regarding management’s interpretation
    of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.
    Management continually reviews the contractual estimation
    process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and
    regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual
    terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We
    have invested significant resources to refine and improve our
    computerized billing systems and the information system data
    used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed
    standardized calculation processes and related training programs
    to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals
    for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the
    federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
    federal poverty level is established by the federal government
    and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts
    from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify
    for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
    those provided to many local managed care plans.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and
    documentation of health care services authorized and provided,
    the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement
    are often subject to interpretations that could result in
    payments that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to
    estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and
    disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to
    revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the
    respective year were $40 million, $32 million and
    $47 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
    in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports
    filed during previous years were $60 million,
    $35 million and $83 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. We expect adjustments during the next
    12 months related to Medicare and Medicaid cost report
    filings and settlements and disproportionate-share funds will
    result in increases to revenues within generally similar ranges.

Provision
    for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
    care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
    primary source of cash and is critical to our operating
    performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured
    patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the
    primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
    applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments)

remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due
    directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful
    accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of
    the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all
    reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
    performed. Our collection policies include a review of all
    accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon
    completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts
    determined to possess positive collectibility attributes are
    forwarded to a secondary external collection agency and the
    other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not
    collected by the secondary external collection agency are
    written off when they are returned to us by the collection
    agency (usually within 12 months). Writeoffs are based upon
    specific identification and the writeoff process requires a
    writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We
    do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that
    meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
    coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on
    the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and
    recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
    revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
    analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating
    the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
    hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
    accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our
    quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful
    accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable
    valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly
    changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments
    to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful
    accounts or

period-to-period

comparisons of our results of operations. At December 31,
    2009 and 2008, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 94% and 92%, respectively, of the
    $5.176 billion and $5.148 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due
    accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured
    portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured
    portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending
    accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable
    balance.

The revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity
    care and uninsured discounts) generally have the inverse effect
    on the provision for doubtful accounts. To quantify the total
    impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe
    it is beneficial to view these revenue deductions and provision
    for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each
    separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended
    December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

Professional
    Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in
    an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities
    are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses
    up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a
    $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention. We
    purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in
    excess of $50 million per occurrence. Our professional
    liability reserves, net of receivables under reinsurance
    contracts, do not include amounts for any estimated losses
    covered by our excess insurance coverage. Provisions for losses
    related to professional liability risks were $211 million,
    $175 million and $163 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the
    estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses
    incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet
    dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct
    expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does
    not include the general overhead costs of our insurance
    subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are
    established based upon the particular circumstances of each
    reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs
    that will be paid on reported claims. Case reserves are reduced
    as claim payments are made and are adjusted upward or downward
    as our estimates regarding the amounts of future losses are
    revised. Once the case reserves for known claims are determined,
    information is stratified by loss layers and retentions,
    accident years, reported years, and geographic location of our
    hospitals. Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize
    this data to produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves
    for incurred but not reported claims, including: paid and
    incurred extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss
    development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity
    methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to
    estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and
    ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and
    Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to
    actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses.
    These methods use our company-specific historical claims data
    and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and
    settlement data collected over an

approximate

20-year

period is used in our reserve estimation process. This
    company-specific data includes information regarding our
    business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment
    expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and
    projected hospital statistical data, professional liability
    retentions for each policy year, geographic information and
    other data.

Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are
    based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated
    reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance
    contracts, were $1.024 billion to $1.270 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and $1.102 billion to
    $1.332 billion at December 31, 2008. Our estimated
    reserves for professional liability claims may change
    significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We
    perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key
    actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy
    relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our
    analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability
    reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for
    ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims
    to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves
    for professional liabilities. A 2% change in the expected
    frequency trend could be reasonable likely and would increase
    the reserve estimate by $16 million or reduce the reserve
    estimate by $15 million. A 2% change in the expected claim
    severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the
    reserve estimate by $69 million or reduce the reserve
    estimate by $63 million. We believe adequate reserves have
    been recorded for our professional liability claims; however,
    due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time
    to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes,
    our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could
    change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could
    change materially from our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,600 and 2,800 individual claims at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time
    period between the occurrence and payment of final settlement
    for our professional liability claims is approximately five
    years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual
    claim can result in an

occurrence-to-settlement

timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the
    timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were
    $1.322 billion and $1.387 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The current portion of these
    reserves, $265 million and $279 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by
    reinsurance contracts are included in the reserves for
    professional liability risks, as the insurance subsidiary
    remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of
    $53 million and $57 million receivable under
    reinsurance contracts at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively) were $1.269 billion and $1.330 billion
    at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimated
    total net reserves for professional liability risks at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008 are comprised of
    $680 million and $724 million, respectively, of case
    reserves for known claims and $589 million and
    $606 million, respectively, of reserves for incurred but
    not reported claims.

The favorable development related to prior years’ claims
    resulted from declining claim frequency and moderating claim
    severity trends. We believe these favorable trends are primarily
    attributable to tort reforms enacted in key states, particularly
    Texas, and our risk management and patient safety initiatives,
    particularly in the area of obstetrics.

Income
    Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary
    differences that arise from the recognition of items in
    different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax
    assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed
    in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed
    in future periods.

Although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and
    paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or
    international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions
    upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and
    assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax
    return. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and
    circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the
    realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable
    based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability
    and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current
    period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates.

Revenue/Volume
    Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
    and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
    and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services.
    Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are
    actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with
    third-party payers, including government programs and managed
    care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based
    upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per
    diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges.
    We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to

uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
    care that are similar to the discounts provided to many local
    managed care plans.

Revenues increased 5.9% to $30.052 billion for 2009 from
    $28.374 billion for 2008 and increased 5.6% for 2008 from
    $26.858 billion for 2007. The increase in revenues in 2009
    can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.6%
    increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.2% increase
    in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The
    increase in revenues in 2008 can be primarily attributed to the
    combined impact of a 5.2% increase in revenue per equivalent
    admission and a 0.5% increase in equivalent admissions compared
    to 2007.

Consolidated admissions increased 1.0% in 2009 compared to 2008
    and declined 0.7% in 2008 compared to 2007. Consolidated
    inpatient surgeries increased 0.3% and consolidated outpatient
    surgeries declined 0.4% during 2009 compared to 2008.
    Consolidated inpatient surgeries declined 4.5% and consolidated
    outpatient surgeries declined 0.9% during 2008 compared to 2007.
    Consolidated emergency department visits increased 6.6% during
    2009 compared to 2008 and increased 2.5% during 2008 compared to
    2007.

Same facility revenues increased 6.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and increased 7.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The 6.1% increase for 2009 can be
    primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase
    in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.4%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 7.0%
    increase for 2008 can be primarily attributed to the combined
    impact of a 5.1% increase in same facility revenue per
    equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same facility
    equivalent admissions.

Same facility admissions increased 1.2% in 2009 compared to 2008
    and increased 0.9% in 2008 compared to 2007. Same facility
    inpatient surgeries increased 0.5% and same facility outpatient
    surgeries declined 0.1% during 2009 compared to 2008. Same
    facility inpatient surgeries declined 0.5% and same facility
    outpatient surgeries declined 0.2% during 2008 compared to 2007.

    compared to 2008. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits
    increased 4.5% and same facility uninsured admissions increased
    1.7% during 2008 compared to 2007. Management believes same
    facility uninsured emergency department visits and same facility
    uninsured admissions could continue to increase during 2010 if
    the adverse general economic and unemployment trends continue.

At December 31, 2009, we owned and operated 38 hospitals
    and 33 surgery centers in the state of Florida. Our Florida
    facilities’ revenues totaled $7.343 billion and
    $7.099 billion for the years ended December 31, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, we owned and
    operated 35 hospitals and 23 surgery centers in the state of
    Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled
    $8.042 billion and $7.351 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During 2009 and
    2008, 57% and 55%, respectively, of our admissions and 51% of
    our revenues were generated by our Florida and Texas facilities.
    Uninsured admissions in Florida and Texas represented 64% and
    63% of our uninsured admissions during 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

We provided $2.151 billion, $1.747 billion and
    $1.530 billion of charity care (amounts are based upon our
    gross charges) during the years ended December 31, 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. We provide discounts to uninsured
    patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These
    discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed
    care plans and totaled $2.935 billion, $1.853 billion
    and $1.474 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government
    health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are
    highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial
    changes. We have increased the indigent care services we provide
    in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation
    with other hospitals. The state of Texas has been involved in
    the effort to increase the indigent care provided by private
    hospitals. As a result of this additional indigent care provided
    by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in
    Texas have available funds that were previously devoted to
    indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are
    under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such
    indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have
    elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the
    state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole
    discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is
    anticipated that these contributions to the state will be
    matched with federal Medicaid funds. The state then may make
    supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid
    services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental
    payments may include those that are providing additional
    indigent care services. Such payments must be within the federal
    UPL established by federal regulation. Our Texas Medicaid
    revenues included $474 million, $262 million and
    $232 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, of
    Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to UPL programs.

Net income attributable to HCA Inc. totaled $1.054 billion
    for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to
    $673 million for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Financial results for 2009 include losses on sales of facilities

Revenues increased 5.9% to $30.052 billion for 2009 from

    primarily to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 3.2% increase in equivalent
    admissions compared to 2008. Same facility revenues increased
    6.1% due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase in
    same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.4%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2008.

During 2009, consolidated admissions increased 1.0% and same
    facility admissions increased 1.2% for 2009, compared to 2008.
    Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3%, and same
    facility inpatient surgeries increased 0.5% during 2009 compared
    to 2008. Consolidated outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.4%,
    and same facility outpatient surgeries declined 0.1% during 2009
    compared to 2008. Emergency department visits increased 6.6% on
    a consolidated basis and increased 7.0% on a same facility basis
    during 2009 compared to 2008.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 39.8%
    in 2009 and 40.3% in 2008. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 1.3% in 2009 compared to 2008. Same facility
    labor rate increases averaged 3.7% for 2009 compared to 2008.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.2% in 2009 and
    16.3% in 2008. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    2.1% in 2009 compared to 2008. Same facility supply costs
    increased 5.9% for medical devices, 4.0% for pharmacy supplies,
    7.1% for blood products and 7.0% for general medical and
    surgical items in 2009 compared to 2008.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined
    to 15.7% in 2009 from 16.1% in 2008. Other operating expenses
    are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome
    taxes. The overall decline in other operating expenses, as a
    percentage of revenues, is comprised of relatively small
    reductions in several areas, including utilities, employee
    recruitment and travel and entertainment. Other operating
    expenses include $248 million and $144 million of
    indigent care costs in certain Texas markets during 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Provisions for losses related to
    professional liability risks were $211 million and
    $175 million for 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Provision for doubtful accounts declined $133 million, from
    $3.409 billion in 2008 to $3.276 billion in 2009, and
    as a percentage of revenues, declined to 10.9% for 2009 from
    12.0% in 2008. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured
    amounts due directly from patients. The decline in the provision
    for doubtful accounts can be attributed to the
    $1.486 billion increase in the combined self-pay revenue
    deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts during 2009,
    compared to 2008. The sum of the provision for doubtful
    accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage
    of the sum of net revenues, uninsured discounts and charity
    care, was 23.8% for 2009, compared to 21.9% for 2008. At
    December 31, 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 94% of the $5.176 billion total
    patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net
    of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts
    was being evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $223 million for 2008 to $246 million for 2009. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

    Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenues, to 4.8% in 2009 from 5.0% in 2008. Depreciation
    expense was $1.419 billion for 2009 and $1.412 billion
    for 2008.

Interest expense decreased to $1.987 billion for 2009 from
    $2.021 billion for 2008. The decrease in interest expense
    was due to reductions in the average debt balance. Our average
    debt balance was $26.267 billion for 2009 compared to
    $27.211 billion for 2008. The average interest rate for our
    long-term debt increased from 7.4% for 2008 to 7.6% for 2009.

Net losses on sales of facilities were $15 million for 2009
    and included $8 million of net losses on the sales of three
    hospital facilities and $7 million of net losses on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments. Gains
    on sales of facilities were $97 million for 2008 and
    included $81 million of gains on the sales of two hospital
    facilities and $16 million of net gains on sales of real
    estate and other health care entity investments.

Impairments of long-lived assets were $43 million for 2009
    and included $19 million related to goodwill and
    $24 million related to property and equipment. Impairments
    of long-lived assets were $64 million for 2008 and included
    $48 million related to goodwill and $16 million
    related to property and equipment.

The effective tax rate was 37.3% and 28.5% for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net
    income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to
    consolidated partnerships. Primarily as a result of reaching a
    settlement with the IRS Appeals Division and the revision of the
    amount of a proposed IRS adjustment related to prior taxable
    periods, we reduced our provision for income taxes by
    $69 million in 2008. Excluding the effect of these
    adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2008 would have been
    35.8%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased
    from $229 million for 2008 to $321 million for 2009.
    The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests related primarily to growth in operating results of
    hospital joint ventures in two Texas markets.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

Net income attributable to HCA Inc. totaled $673 million
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    $874 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Financial results for 2008 include gains on sales of facilities
    of $97 million and asset impairment charges of
    $64 million. Financial results for 2007 include gains on
    sales of facilities of $471 million and an asset impairment
    charge of $24 million.

Revenues increased 5.6% to $28.374 billion for 2008 from
    $26.858 billion for 2007. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to the combined impact of a 5.2% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 0.5% increase in equivalent
    admissions compared to 2007. Same facility revenues increased
    7.0% due primarily to the combined impact of a 5.1% increase in
    same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2007.

During 2008, consolidated admissions declined 0.7% and same
    facility admissions increased 0.9%, compared to 2007. Inpatient
    surgical volumes declined 4.5% on a consolidated basis and same
    facility inpatient surgeries declined 0.5% during 2008 compared
    to 2007. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 0.9% on a
    consolidated basis and same facility outpatient surgeries
    declined 0.2% during 2008 compared to 2007. Emergency department
    visits increased 2.5% on a consolidated basis and increased 3.6%
    on a same facility basis during 2008 compared to 2007.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.3%
    in 2008 and 39.9% in 2007. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 6.3% in 2008 compared to 2007. Same facility
    labor rate increases averaged 5.1% for 2008 compared to 2007.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% in 2008 and
    16.4% in 2007. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    4.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Same facility supply costs
    increased 8.0% for medical devices, 2.8% for pharmacy supplies,
    18.7% for blood products and 6.6% for general medical and
    surgical items in 2008 compared to 2007.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased
    to 16.1% in 2008 from 15.7% in 2007. Other operating expenses
    are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome
    taxes. Increases in professional fees paid to hospitalists,
    emergency room physicians and anesthesiologists represented
    20 basis points of the 2008 increase in other operating
    expenses. Other operating expenses include $144 million and
    $187 million of indigent care costs in certain Texas
    markets during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Provisions for
    losses related to professional liability risks were
    $175 million and $163 million for 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of revenues,
    increased to 12.0% for 2008 from 11.7% in 2007. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from
    patients. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts,
    as a percentage of revenues, can be attributed to an increasing
    amount of patient financial responsibility under certain managed
    care plans and same facility increases in uninsured emergency
    room visits of 4.5% and uninsured admissions of 1.7% in 2008
    compared to 2007. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for
    doubtful accounts represented approximately 92% of the
    $5.148 billion total patient due accounts receivable
    balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual
    discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for
    Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $206 million for 2007 to $223 million for 2008. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization declined, as a percentage of
    revenues, to 5.0% in 2008 from 5.4% in 2007. Depreciation
    expense was $1.412 billion for 2008 and $1.421 billion
    for 2007.

Interest expense declined to $2.021 billion for 2008 from
    $2.215 billion for 2007. The decline in interest expense
    was due to reductions in both the average debt balance and the
    average interest rate on long-term debt. Our average debt
    balance was $27.211 billion for 2008 compared to
    $27.732 billion for 2007. The average interest rate for our
    long-term debt declined from 8.0% for 2007 to 7.4% for 2008.

Gains on sales of facilities were $97 million for 2008 and
    included $81 million of net gains on the sales of two
    hospital facilities and $16 million of net gains on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments. Gains
    on sales of facilities were $471 million for 2007 and
    included a $312 million gain on the sale of our two
    Switzerland hospitals, a $131 million gain on the sale of a
    facility in Florida and $28 million of net gains on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments.

Impairments of long-lived assets were $64 million for 2008
    and included $48 million related to goodwill and
    $16 million related to property and equipment. The
    $24 million asset impairment for 2007 related to property
    and equipment.

The effective tax rate was 28.5% for 2008 and 26.6% for 2007,
    respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net
    income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to
    consolidated partnerships. Primarily as a result of reaching a

information related to tax positions taken in a prior taxable
    year, and by an additional $39 million to adjust
    2006 state tax accruals to the amounts reported on
    completed tax returns and based upon an analysis of the
    Recapitalization costs. Excluding the effect of these
    adjustments, the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007 would
    have been 35.8% and 37.0%, respectively.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased
    from $208 million for 2007 to $229 million for 2008.
    The increase relates primarily to our Austin, Texas market
    partnership and our group purchasing organization.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses,
    servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing
    properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care
    entities and distributions to noncontrolling interests. Our
    primary cash sources are cash flow from operating activities,
    issuances of debt and equity securities and dispositions of
    hospitals and other health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $2.747 billion in 2009 compared to $1.990 billion in
    2008 and $1.564 billion in 2007. Working capital totaled
    $2.264 billion at December 31, 2009 and
    $2.391 billion at December 31, 2008. The
    $757 million increase in cash provided by operating
    activities for 2009, compared to 2008, related primarily to the
    $473 million increase in net income and $143 million
    improvement from changes in operating assets and liabilities and
    the provision for doubtful accounts. The $426 million
    increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2008,
    compared to 2007, relates primarily to changes in working
    capital items. The changes in accounts receivable (net of the
    provision for doubtful accounts), inventories and other assets,
    and accounts payable and accrued expenses contributed
    $42 million to cash provided by operating activities for
    2008 while changes in these items decreased cash provided by
    operating activities by $485 million for 2007. The net
    impact of the cash payments for interest and income taxes was an
    increase in cash payments of $203 million for 2009 compared
    to 2008 and an increase of $111 million for 2008 compared
    to 2007.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.035 billion,
    $1.467 billion and $479 million in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
    were $1.317 billion in 2009, $1.600 billion in 2008
    and $1.444 billion in 2007. We expended $61 million,
    $85 million and $32 million for acquisitions of
    hospitals and health care entities during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions in all three years
    were generally comprised of outpatient and ancillary services
    entities and were funded by a combination of cash flows from
    operations and the issuance or incurrence of debt. Planned
    capital expenditures are expected to approximate
    $1.5 billion in 2010. At December 31, 2009, there were
    projects under construction which had an estimated additional
    cost to complete and equip over the next five years of
    $1.2 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures
    with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2009, we received cash proceeds of $41 million from
    dispositions of three hospitals and sales of other health care
    entities and real estate investments. We also received net cash
    proceeds of $303 million related to net changes in our
    investments. During 2008, we received cash proceeds of
    $143 million from dispositions of two hospitals and
    $50 million from sales of other health care entities and
    real estate investments. During 2007, we sold three hospitals
    for cash proceeds of $661 million, and we also received
    cash proceeds of $106 million related primarily to the
    sales of real estate investments and $207 million related
    to net changes in our investments.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.865 billion in
    2009, $451 million in 2008 and $1.326 billion in 2007.
    During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we used cash proceeds from sales of
    facilities and available cash provided by operations to make net
    debt repayments of $1.459 billion, $260 million and
    $1.270 billion, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of
    $330 million, $178 million and

$152 million, respectively. We also paid debt issuance
    costs of $70 million for 2009. We or our affiliates,
    including affiliates of the Sponsors, may in the future
    repurchase portions of our debt securities, subject to certain
    limitations, from time to time in either the open market or
    through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with
    applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices,
    and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices,
    general economic and market conditions, and other factors,
    including applicable securities laws. Funds for the repurchase
    of debt securities have, and are expected to, come primarily
    from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
    capital include amounts available under our senior secured
    credit facilities ($3.181 billion as of December 31,
    2009 and $3.142 billion as of January 31,
    2010) and anticipated access to public and private debt
    markets.

On January 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    vested stock options. The distribution was $17.50 per share and
    vested stock option, or approximately $1.750 billion in the
    aggregate. The distribution was paid on February 5, 2010 to
    holders of record on February 1, 2010. The distribution was
    funded using funds available under our existing senior secured
    credit facilities and approximately $100 million of cash on
    hand.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiary,
    to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
    $1.316 billion and $1.622 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The insurance subsidiary maintained
    net reserves for professional liability risks of
    $590 million and $782 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our
    wholly- owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence; however, since January 2007,
    this coverage is subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention. Net reserves for the self-insured
    professional liability risks retained were $679 million and
    $548 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries,
    during the next 12 months are expected to approximate
    $240 million. We estimate that approximately
    $90 million of the expected net claim payments during the
    next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the
    self-insured retention.

Financing
    Activities

Due to the Recapitalization, we are a highly leveraged company
    with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled
    $25.670 billion and $26.989 billion at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our interest
    expense was $1.987 billion for 2009 and $2.021 billion
    for 2008.

During February 2009, we issued $310 million aggregate
    principal amount of

    secured second lien notes due 2017 at a price of 96.673% of
    their face value, resulting in $300 million of gross

    aggregate principal amount of

    principal amount of

    secured first lien notes due 2020 at a price of 98.254% of their
    face value, resulting in $1.228 billion of gross proceeds.
    After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the
    proceeds from these debt offerings to repay outstanding
    indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts
    available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
    anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be
    sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next
    twelve months.

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.309 billion and $7 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2009. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2009, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $20 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash in
    excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
    expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a
    price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a
    normal market environment. At December 31, 2009, our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had invested $396 million
    ($401 million par value) in municipal, tax-exempt student
    loan auction rate securities (“ARS”) that continue to
    experience market illiquidity since February 2008 when multiple
    failed auctions occurred due to a severe credit and liquidity
    crisis in the capital markets. It is uncertain if
    auction-related market liquidity will resume for these
    securities. We may be required to recognize

other-than-temporary

impairments on these investments in future periods should
    issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market
    valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings
    downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations.
    Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed
    and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based
    on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have
    been recognized in the financial statements at their respective
    fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
    included in other comprehensive income.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately
    $1.205 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2009
    is subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining
    balance in long-term debt of $24.465 billion at
    December 31, 2009 is subject to fixed rates of interest.
    Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior
    secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable
    interest rates. Our variable rate debt is comprised primarily of
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities.
    Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our
    option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR
    rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant
    interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the
    senior secured credit facilities, with the exception of term
    loan B where the margin is static, may be reduced subject to
    attaining certain leverage ratios. The average rate for our
    long-term debt increased from 6.9% at December 31, 2008 to
    7.6% at December 31, 2009.

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $13.550 billion and
    €1.000 billion senior secured cash flow credit
    facility, dated as of November 17, 2006, as amended
    February 16, 2007 (the “cash flow credit
    facility”), to allow for one or more future issuances of
    additional secured notes, which may include notes that are
    secured on a

pari passu

basis or on a junior basis with
    the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as
    (1) such notes do not require any scheduled payment or
    redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B final maturity
    date as currently in effect and (2) the proceeds from any
    such issuance are used within three business days of receipt to
    prepay term loans under the cash flow credit facility in
    accordance with the terms of the cash flow credit facility. The
    U.S. security documents related to the cash flow credit
    facility were also amended and restated in connection with the
    amendment in order to give effect to the security interests
    granted to holders of such additional secured notes.

Market
    Risk (Continued)

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $2.000 billion senior
    secured asset-based revolving credit facility, dated as of
    November 17, 2006, as amended and restated as of
    June 20, 2007 (the “ABL credit facility”), to
    allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured
    notes or loans, which may include notes or loans that are
    secured on a

pari passu

basis or on a junior basis with
    the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as
    the proceeds from any such issuance are used to prepay term
    loans under the cash flow credit facility within three business
    days of the receipt thereof. The amendment to the ABL credit
    facility also altered the excess facility availability
    requirement to include a separate minimum facility availability
    requirement applicable to the ABL credit facility, and increased
    the applicable LIBOR and ABR margins for all borrowings under
    the ABL credit facility by 0.25% each.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was
    $25.659 billion at December 31, 2009. The estimates of
    fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.
    Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the
    potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would
    be approximately $12 million. To mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of
    our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

Our international operations and the European term loan expose
    us to market risks associated with foreign currencies. In order
    to mitigate the currency exposure related to debt service
    obligations through December 31, 2011 under the European
    term loan, we have entered into cross currency swap agreements.
    A cross currency swap is an agreement between two parties to
    exchange a stream of principal and interest payments in one
    currency for a stream of principal and interest payments in
    another currency over a specified period.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they
    are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
    subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
    the hedged items when they occur. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a
    hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the
    remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Effects
    of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
    certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
    for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare
    patients are established under the federal government’s
    prospective payment system. Total

fee-for-service

Medicare revenues approximated 23% in 2009, 23% in 2008 and 24%
    in 2007 of our total patient revenues.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have
    been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because
    of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses in
    excess of the increase in prospective payments under the
    Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
    regulatory and

competitive pressures, our ability to maintain operating margins
    through price increases to non-Medicare patients is limited.

IRS
    Disputes

At December 31, 2009, we were contesting before the Appeals
    Division of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”)
    certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS
    in connection with its examinations of the 2003 and 2004 federal
    income returns for HCA and eight affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). The disputed items include the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues and our method
    for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts.

Six taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1997
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year of four affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are
    pending before the IRS Examination Division as of
    December 31, 2009. The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and
    2006 federal income tax returns for HCA and seven affiliated
    partnerships during 2008. We anticipate the IRS Examination
    Division will conclude its audit in 2010. During 2009, the seven
    affiliated partnership audits were resolved with no material
    impact on our operations or financial position. We anticipate
    the IRS will begin an audit of the 2007 and 2008 federal income
    tax returns for HCA during 2010.

Management believes HCA, its predecessors and affiliates
    properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance
    with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and
    final resolution of these disputes will not have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of
    these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions
    could have a material, adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
    under

Rule 13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this
    evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
    financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this annual report.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
    term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this

Form 10-K,

has issued a report on our internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included herein.



(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited HCA Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). HCA Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 and
    our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

(c)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

During the fourth quarter of 2009, there have been no changes in
    our internal control over financial reporting that have
    materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ deficit,
    and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HCA
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated March 1, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 —

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Merger,
    Recapitalization and Reporting Entity

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. completed its merger (the
    “Merger”) with Hercules Acquisition Corporation,
    pursuant to which the Company was acquired by Hercules Holding
    II, LLC (“Hercules Holding”), a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group comprised of
    affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co., Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity
    (each a “Sponsor”), affiliates of Citigroup Inc. and
    Bank of America Corporation (the “Sponsor Assignees”)
    and affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr.,
    (the “Frist Entities,” and together with the Sponsors
    and the Sponsor Assignees, the “Investors”), and by
    members of management and certain other investors. The Merger,
    the financing transactions related to the Merger and other
    related transactions are collectively referred to in this annual
    report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger was
    accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements,
    with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and
    liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees. On April 29, 2008,
    we registered our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, thus subjecting
    us to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our common stock is
    not traded on a national securities exchange.

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate
    hospitals and related health care entities. The term
    “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
    of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
    subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2009, these
    affiliates owned and operated 155 hospitals, 97 freestanding
    surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary
    services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in joint ventures
    that own and operate eight hospitals and eight freestanding
    surgery centers, which are accounted for using the equity
    method. The Company’s facilities are located in
    20 states and England. The terms “HCA,”
    “Company,” “we,” “our” or
    “us,” as used in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise stated or
    indicated by context.

Basis of
    Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
    and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
    “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting
    interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements
    include entities in which we absorb a majority of the
    entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the
    entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
    ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
    entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in
    which we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise
    significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

We have completed various acquisitions and joint venture
    transactions. The accounts of these entities have been included
    in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent
    to our acquisition of controlling interests. The majority of our
    expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could
    be classified as general and administrative include our
    corporate office costs, which were $164 million,
    $174 million and $169 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
    are recorded based upon established billing rates less
    allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
    during the period the health care services are provided, based
    upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
    payers. Third-party payers

Revenues

include federal and state agencies (under the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs), managed care health plans, commercial
    insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual
    allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the
    payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements.
    Contractual payment terms in managed care agreements are
    generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per diem
    rates or discounted

fee-for-service

rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
    there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates
    will change by a material amount. Estimated reimbursement
    amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are
    prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in
    relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare,
    this is generally referred to as the “cost report”
    filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated
    Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and
    disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to
    revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the
    respective year were $40 million, $32 million and
    $47 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The
    adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
    in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports
    filed during previous years were $60 million,
    $35 million and $83 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, us to provide services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts
    determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
    revenues. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care,
    who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level,
    are eligible for charity care. Charity care (amounts are based
    on our gross charges) totaled $2.151 billion,
    $1.747 billion and $1.530 billion in 2009, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. The federal poverty level is established by
    the federal government and is based on income and family size.
    We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify
    for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
    those provided to many local managed care plans and totaled
    $2.935 billion, $1.853 billion and $1.474 billion
    in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In implementing the
    discount policy, we first attempt to qualify uninsured patients
    for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care.
    If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
    uninsured discount is applied.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance
    subsidiary’s cash equivalent investments in excess of the
    amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims
    during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash
    equivalents as these funds are not available for general
    corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
    approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of
    available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when
    presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks
    totaling $392 million and $382 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, have been
    included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are
    funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts
    Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state
    agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed
    care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and
    patients. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, 23%, 23% and 24%, respectively, of our revenues
    related to patients participating in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program and 7%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of our
    revenues related to patients participating in managed Medicare
    programs. We recognize that revenues and receivables from
    government agencies are significant to our operations, but do
    not believe there are significant credit risks associated with
    these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other
    significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer
    that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the
    collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
    means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
    off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for
    doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The
    amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical and expected net
    collections, business and economic conditions, trends in
    federal, state and private employer health care coverage and
    other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts
    and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to
    “uninsured” amounts (including copayment and
    deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage)
    due directly from patients. Accounts are written off when all
    reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
    performed. We consider the return of an account from the
    secondary external collection agency to be the culmination of
    our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for
    writing off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon
    specific identification and the writeoff process requires a
    writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system.
    Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of
    historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent
    a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the
    “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of
    information to utilize in estimating the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis
    quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable
    collection and writeoff data. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 94% and 92%, respectively, of the
    $5.176 billion and $5.148 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due
    accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured
    portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured
    portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending
    accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable
    balance. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 45 days,
    49 days and 53 days at December 31, 2009, 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Adverse changes in general economic
    conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer
    mix or trends in federal or state governmental health care
    coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable,
    cash flows and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
    was $1.419 billion in 2009, $1.412 billion in 2008 and
    $1.421 billion in 2007. Buildings and improvements are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
    10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
    generally from four to 10 years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the
    respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
    deferred loan costs at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was
    $689 million and $650 million, respectively, and
    accumulated amortization was $271 million and
    $192 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred loan
    costs is included in interest expense and was $80 million,
    $79 million and $78 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles (Continued)

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the
    carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
    identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) expected to
    be held and used, might be impaired, we prepare projections of
    the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
    use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the
    projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
    recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value.
    Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that
    include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows,
    reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
    appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
    their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
    close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
    sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
    discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments
    of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the investments of our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as

“available-for-sale”

as defined in Accounting Standards Codification No. 320,

Investments — Debt and Equity Securities

and
    are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held
    for the purpose of providing the funding source to pay
    professional liability claims covered by the insurance
    subsidiary. We perform a quarterly assessment of individual
    investment securities to determine whether declines in market
    value are temporary or

other-than-temporary.

Our investment securities evaluation process involves multiple
    subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of
    future events, and requires a significant level of professional
    judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. We
    evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near
    term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s
    industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or
    timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and
    recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine
    if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below
    amortized cost is considered

other-than-temporary.

The length of time and extent to which the fair value of the
    investment is less than amortized cost and our ability and
    intent to retain the investment, to allow for any anticipated
    recovery of the investment’s fair value, are important
    components of our investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
    tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment
    reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible
    impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at
    the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below
    the business segment level, and our impairment testing is
    performed at the operating division or market level. We compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying
    amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is
    potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair
    value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value
    of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recognized. Fair value of goodwill is estimated based
    upon internal evaluations of the related long-lived assets for
    each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of
    revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar
    facilities. We recognized goodwill impairments of
    $19 million and $48 million during 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. No goodwill impairments were recognized during
    2007.

During 2009, goodwill increased by $5 million related to
    acquisitions, decreased by $19 million related to
    impairments and increased by $11 million related to foreign
    currency translation and other adjustments. During 2008,
    goodwill increased by $43 million related to acquisitions,
    decreased by $14 million related to facility sales,
    decreased by $48 million related to impairments and
    decreased by $30 million related to foreign currency
    translation and other adjustments.

Goodwill
    (Continued)

Since January 1, 2000, we have recognized total goodwill
    impairments of $88 million in the aggregate. None of the
    goodwill impairments related to evaluations of goodwill at the
    reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill impairments
    during this period related to goodwill allocated to asset
    disposal groups.

Physician
    Recruiting Agreements

In order to recruit physicians to meet the needs of our
    hospitals and the communities they serve, we enter into minimum
    revenue guarantee arrangements to assist the recruited
    physicians during the period they are relocating and
    establishing their practices. A guarantor is required to
    recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
    fair value of the stand-ready obligation undertaken in issuing
    the guarantee. We expense the total estimated guarantee
    liability amount at the time the physician recruiting agreement
    becomes effective as we are not able to justify recording a
    contract-based asset based upon our analysis of the related
    control, regulatory and legal considerations.

The physician recruiting liability amounts of $24 million
    and $27 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, represent the amount of expense recognized in
    excess of payments made through December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. At December 31, 2009 the maximum amount we
    could have to pay under all effective minimum revenue guarantees
    was $64 million.

Professional
    Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were
    $1.322 billion and $1.387 billion at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The current portion of the
    reserves, $265 million and $279 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance
    sheets. Provisions for losses related to professional liability
    risks were $211 million, $175 million and
    $163 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and are
    included in “other operating expenses” in our
    consolidated income statements. Provisions for losses related to
    professional liability risks are based upon actuarially
    determined estimates. Loss and loss expense reserves represent
    the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported
    losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance
    sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses
    are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and
    actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects
    of trends in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are
    continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience
    develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the
    estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating
    results. The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,600 and 2,800 individual claims at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2009 and 2008,
    $272 million and $314 million, respectively, of net
    payments were made for professional and general liability
    claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year
    can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is
    inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe
    the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however,
    there can be no assurance the ultimate liability will not exceed
    our estimates.

A portion of our professional liability risks is insured through
    a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a
    $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our
    facilities are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
    for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance
    subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability
    risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per
    occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance
    with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
    amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

Professional
    Liability Claims (Continued)

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are included in
    the reserves for professional liability risks, as the insurance
    subsidiary remains liable to the extent the reinsurers do not
    meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. The
    amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include
    $28 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008 recorded in
    “other assets” and $25 million and
    $29 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, recorded in “other current assets”.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including interest rate and foreign currency exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss), depending on whether the derivative financial
    instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it
    qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally,
    changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair
    value hedges are recorded in earnings, along with the changes in
    the fair value of the hedged items related to the hedged risk.
    Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges,
    to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to
    earnings to offset the impact of the forecasted transactions
    when they occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to
    which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount
    in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings
    and generally the derivative is terminated. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any
    portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining term of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
    entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded
    noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such
    entities.

Related
    Party Transactions — Management Agreement

Affiliates of the Investors entered into a management agreement
    with us pursuant to which such affiliates will provide us with
    management services. Under the management agreement, the
    affiliates of the Investors are entitled to receive an aggregate
    annual management fee of $15 million, which amount
    increases annually, beginning in 2008, at a rate equal to the
    percentage increase in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the
    Management Agreement) in the applicable year compared to the
    preceding year, and reimbursement of

out-of-pocket

expenses incurred in connection with the provision of services
    pursuant to the agreement. The annual management fee was
    $15 million for each of 2009, 2008 and 2007. The management
    agreement has an initial term expiring on December 31,
    2016, provided that the term will be extended annually for one
    additional year unless we or the Investors provide notice to the
    other of their desire not to automatically extend the term. In
    addition, the management agreement provides that the affiliates
    of the Investors are entitled to receive a fee equal to 1% of
    the gross transaction value in connection with certain
    financing, acquisition, disposition, and change of control
    transactions, as well as a termination fee based on the net
    present value of future payment obligations under the management
    agreement in the event of an initial public offering or under
    certain other circumstances. The agreement also contains
    customary exculpation and indemnification provisions in favor of
    the Investors and their affiliates.

Certain management holders of outstanding HCA stock options

    The Rollover Options remain outstanding in accordance with the
    terms of the governing stock incentive plans and grant
    agreements pursuant to which the holder originally received the
    stock option grants, except the exercise price and number of
    shares subject to the rollover option agreement were adjusted so
    that the aggregate intrinsic value for each applicable option
    holder was maintained and the exercise price for substantially
    all the options was adjusted to $12.75 per option. Pursuant to
    the rollover option agreement, 10,967,500 prerecapitalization
    HCA stock options were converted into 2,285,200 Rollover
    Options, of which 1,349,800 are outstanding and exercisable at

    Stock Incentive Plan

The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Inc. and
    its Affiliates (the “2006 Plan”) is designed to
    promote the long term financial interests and growth of the
    Company and its subsidiaries by attracting and retaining
    management and other personnel and key service providers and to
    motivate management personnel by means of incentives to achieve
    long range goals and further the alignment of interests of
    participants with those of our stockholders through
    opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in
    the Company. A portion of the options under the 2006 Plan vests
    solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of
    time, and a portion of the options vests based both upon
    continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the
    achievement of predetermined financial and Investor return
    targets over time. We granted 1,785,900 and 357,500 options
    under the 2006 Plan during 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2009, 3,010,000 options granted under the 2006
    Plan have vested, and there were 392,400 shares available
    for future grants under the 2006 Plan.

Stock
    Option Activity

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the
    grant date, using option valuation models and the weighted
    average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards
    under the 2006 Plan generally vest based on continued employment
    and based upon achievement of certain financial and Investor
    return targets. Each grant is valued as a single award with an
    expected term equal to the average expected term of the
    component vesting tranches. We use historical option exercise
    behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of
    the options. The expected term of the option is limited by the
    contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior
    is incorporated in the historical option exercise behavior data.
    Compensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution
    method. The straight-line attribution method requires that total
    compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested
    portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is
    derived using historical stock price information of certain peer
    group companies for a period of time equal to the expected
    option term. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate
    yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to
    the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life
    is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held
    before it is exercised.

During 2009, we paid $61 million to acquire nonhospital
    health care entities. During 2008, we paid $18 million to
    acquire one hospital and $67 million to acquire other
    health care entities. During 2007, we paid $32 million to
    acquire nonhospital health care entities. Purchase price amounts
    have been allocated to the related assets acquired and
    liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The
    purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable
    net assets of acquired entities aggregated $5 million,
    $43 million and $44 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts and operations of the acquired entities subsequent to
    the respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effects of the
    acquired entities on our results of operations for periods prior
    to the respective acquisition dates were not significant.

During 2009, we received proceeds of $3 million and
    recognized a net pretax loss of $8 million ($5 million
    after tax) on the sales of three hospitals. We also received
    proceeds of $38 million and recognized a net pretax loss of
    $7 million ($4 million after tax) from sales of other
    health care entities and real estate investments. During 2008,
    we received proceeds of $143 million and recognized a net
    pretax gain of $81 million ($48 million after tax)
    from the sales of two hospitals. We also received proceeds of
    $50 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $16 million ($10 million after tax) from sales of
    other health care entities and real estate investments. During
    2007, we received proceeds of $661 million and recognized a
    net pretax gain of $443 million ($272 million after
    tax) from sales of three hospitals. We also received proceeds of
    $106 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $28 million ($18 million after tax) from sales of real
    estate investments.

IMPAIRMENTS
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2009, we recorded pretax charges of $43 million to
    reduce the carrying value of identified assets to estimated fair
    value. The $43 million asset impairment includes
    $15 million related to certain hospital facilities and
    other health care entity investments in our Central Group,
    $14 million related to other health care entity investments
    in our Eastern Group and $14 million related to certain
    hospital facilities in our Western Group. During 2008, we
    recorded pretax charges of $64 million to reduce the
    carrying value of identified assets to estimated fair value. The
    $64 million asset impairment includes $55 million
    related to other health care entity investments in our Eastern
    Group and $9 million related to certain hospital facilities
    in our Central Group. During 2007, we recorded a pretax charge
    of $24 million to adjust the value of a building in our
    Central Group to estimated fair value.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
    on our operations or cash flows and are not expected to
    significantly impact cash flows for future periods. The
    impairment charges affected our property and equipment asset
    category by $24 million, $16 million and
    $24 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

At December 31, 2009, state net operating loss
    carryforwards (expiring in years 2010 through
    2029) available to offset future taxable income
    approximated $116 million. Utilization of net operating
    loss carryforwards in any one year may be limited and, in
    certain cases, result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Net
    deferred tax assets related to such carryforwards are not
    significant.

At December 31, 2009, we are contesting before the Appeals
    Division of the IRS certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments
    proposed by the IRS in connection with its examination of the
    2003 and 2004 federal income tax returns for HCA and eight
    affiliates that are treated as partnerships for federal income
    tax purposes (“affiliated partnerships”). The disputed
    items include the timing of recognition of certain patient
    service revenues and our method for calculating the tax
    allowance for doubtful accounts.

Six taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1997
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year of four affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, were
    pending before the IRS Examination Division as of
    December 31, 2009.

The IRS began an audit of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and seven affiliated partnerships during 2008.
    We anticipate the IRS Examination Division will conclude its
    audit in 2010. During 2009, the seven affiliated partnership
    audits were resolved with no material impact on our operations
    or financial position. We anticipate the IRS will begin an audit
    of the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns for HCA during
    2010.

During 2008, we reached a settlement with the IRS Appeals
    Division relating to the deductibility of the 2001 government
    settlement payment, the timing of recognition of certain patient
    service revenues for 2001 and 2002, and the amount of insurance
    expense deducted in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the
    settlement, $111 million of the $215 million
    refundable deposit made in 2006 has been applied to tax and
    interest due for the 2001 and 2002 taxable years.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was
    $628 million, including accrued interest of
    $156 million and excluding $13 million that was
    recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets, as of
    December 31, 2009 ($625 million, $156 million and
    $13 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2008).
    Unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million
    ($264 million as of December 31, 2008) would
    affect the effective rate, if recognized. The liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits does not reflect deferred tax assets
    of $77 million ($81 million as of December 31,
    2008) related to deductible interest and state income taxes
    or a refundable deposit of $104 million, which is recorded
    in noncurrent assets.

Depending on the resolution of the IRS disputes, the completion
    of examinations by federal, state or international taxing
    authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for
    specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably
    possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    significantly increase or decrease within the next
    12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the
    range of any possible change.

Interest
    Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
    agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
    interest payments between two parties based on common notional
    principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate
    swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate
    instruments to fixed interest rate obligations. The net interest
    payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements,
    generally match the timing of the related liabilities. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis.

    agreements, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, at

    order to better match the cash flows of our obligations and
    intercompany transactions with cash flows from operations, we
    entered into various cross currency swaps. Our credit risk
    related to these agreements is considered low because the swap
    agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.

We have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties

ASSETS
    AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC 820”) defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to reported
    balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair
    value under existing accounting pronouncements.

ASC 820 emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, not
    an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value
    measurement should be determined based on the assumptions market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a
    basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair
    value

F-20


HCA
    INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 8 —

ASSETS
    AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (Continued)

measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on
    market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
    entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2
    of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own
    assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable
    inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
    are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for
    similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as
    inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted
    prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
    yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own
    assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market
    activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value
    measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair
    value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within
    which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the
    lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in
    its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular
    input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
    judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or
    liability.

Cash
    Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within
    Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because
    they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer
    quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable
    levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash traded
    instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value
    hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have
    little or no price transparency. Such instruments include
    auction rate securities (“ARS”) and limited
    partnership investments. The transaction price is initially used
    as the best estimate of fair value.

Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had investments in
    municipal, tax-exempt ARS, that are backed by student loans
    substantially guaranteed by the federal government, of
    $396 million ($401 million par value) at
    December 31, 2009. We do not currently intend to attempt to
    sell the ARS as the liquidity needs of our insurance subsidiary
    are expected to be met by other investments in its investment
    portfolio. These securities continue to accrue and pay interest
    semi-annually based on the failed auction maximum rate formulas
    stated in their respective Official Statements. During 2009 and
    2008, certain issuers and their broker/dealers redeemed or
    repurchased $172 million and $93 million,
    respectively, of our ARS at par value. The valuation of these
    securities involved management’s judgment, after
    consideration of market factors and the absence of market
    transparency, market liquidity and observable inputs. Our
    valuation models derived a fair market value compared to
    tax-equivalent yields of other student loan backed variable rate
    securities of similar credit worthiness.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate and cross currency swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
    rates and foreign currency risks. The valuation of these
    instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation
    techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the
    expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects
    the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period
    to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
    interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied
    volatilities. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we
    incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own
    nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s
    nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although we determined the majority of the inputs used to value
    our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our
    derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of
    current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by
    us and our counterparties. We assessed the

significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments
    on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and at
    December 31, 2008, we determined the credit valuation
    adjustments were significant to the overall valuation of our
    derivatives; however, we determined the credit valuation
    adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our
    derivatives at December 31, 2009. As a result, we have
    reclassified our derivative valuations in their entirety from
    Level 3 to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at

Senior
    Secured Credit Facilities And Other First Lien Debt

In connection with the Recapitalization, we entered into
    (i) a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based
    revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of 85% of
    eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and
    eligibility criteria ($1.280 billion available at
    December 31, 2009) (the “ABL credit facility”)
    and (ii) a senior secured credit agreement (the “cash
    flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit
    facility, the “senior secured credit facilities”),
    consisting of a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.901 billion available at December 31, 2009 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($1.908 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2009), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    ($6.515 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2009) and a €1.000 billion European term loan
    (€394 million, or $564 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2009) under which one of our European
    subsidiaries is the borrower.

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to, as determined by the type of
    borrowing, either an applicable margin plus, at our option,
    either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the
    higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or
    (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR
    rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant
    interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The
    applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit
    facilities, with the exception of term loan B where the margin
    is static, may be reduced subject to attaining certain leverage
    ratios.

The ABL credit facility and the $2.000 billion revolving
    credit facility portion of the cash flow credit facility expire
    November 2012. The term loan facilities require quarterly
    installment payments. The final payment under term loan A is in
    November 2012. The final payments under term loan B and the
    European term loan are in November 2013. The senior secured
    credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict,
    subject to certain exceptions, our (and some or all of our
    subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness,
    repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell
    assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain
    transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and distributions,
    and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we
    are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage
    ratio covenant under the cash flow credit facility and, in
    certain situations under the ABL credit facility, a minimum
    interest coverage ratio covenant.

Senior

    (Continued)

During April 2009, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate
    principal amount of

    secured first lien notes due 2019 at a price of 96.755% of their
    face value, resulting in $1.451 billion of gross proceeds.
    During August 2009, we issued $1.250 billion aggregate
    principal amount of

    secured first lien notes due 2020 at a price of 98.254% of their
    face value, resulting in $1.228 billion of gross proceeds.
    After the payment of related fees and expenses, we used the
    proceeds from these debt issuances to repay outstanding
    indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate
    exposure of our debt portfolio. At December 31, 2009, we
    had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a
    total notional amount of $8.5 billion, in order to hedge a
    portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments
    associated with the senior secured credit facility. The effect
    of the interest rate swaps is reflected in the effective
    interest rates for the senior secured credit facilities.

Senior

In November 2006, we issued $4.200 billion of senior
    secured notes (comprised of $1.000 billion of

    in-kind senior secured toggle notes (which allow us, at our
    option, to pay interest in-kind during the first five years) due
    2016, which are subject to certain standard covenants. We made
    the interest payment for the interest period ended in May 2009
    by paying in-kind ($78 million) instead of paying interest
    in cash.

During February 2009, we issued $310 million aggregate
    principal amount of


/

    secured second lien notes due 2017 at a price of 96.673% of
    their face value, resulting in $300 million of gross
    proceeds. After the payment of related fees and expenses, we
    used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under our
    senior secured term loan facilities.

General
    Debt Information

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all
    existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material
    domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted
    Subsidiaries” under our Indenture (the “1993
    Indenture”) dated December 16, 1993 (except for
    certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and
    pledge their assets under our ABL credit facility). In addition,
    borrowings under the European term loan are guaranteed by all
    material, wholly-owned European subsidiaries.

All obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the
    guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to
    permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien
    on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and
    each guarantor under such ABL credit facility (the
    “Receivables Collateral”).

All obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the
    guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted
    liens and other exceptions, by:

•

a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc., or
    by any U.S. guarantor, in each of their respective
    first-tier subsidiaries;

•

a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future
    assets of HCA Inc. and of each U.S. guarantor other than
    (i) “Principal Properties” (as defined in the
    1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and
    (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts,
    cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other
    exceptions; and

•

a second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral.

CONTINGENCIES

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position in a given period.

We are subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
    staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may
    seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by
    insurance. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate
    resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will
    not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial position.

NOTE 11 —

CAPITAL
    STOCK

The Company’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws were
    amended and restated, effective March 27, 2008 and
    March 26, 2008, respectively. The amended and restated
    certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to issue up
    to 125,000,000 shares of common stock, and the amended and
    restated by-laws set the number of directors constituting the
    board of directors of the Company at not less than one nor more
    than 15.

Stockholder
    Agreements and Equity Securities with Contingent
    Redemption Rights

The stockholder agreements, among other things, contain
    agreements among the parties with respect to restrictions on the
    transfer of shares, including tag along rights and drag along
    rights, registration rights (including customary indemnification
    provisions) and other rights. Pursuant to the management
    stockholder agreements, the applicable employees can elect to
    have the Company redeem their common stock and vested stock
    options in the events of death or permanent disability, prior to
    the consummation of the initial public offering of common stock
    by the Company. At December 31, 2009, 1,968,400 common
    shares and 4,207,800 vested stock options were subject to these
    contingent redemption terms.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
    that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
    requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match
    specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain
    maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending
    upon years of vesting

service, of compensation deferred by participants for periods
    subsequent to March 31, 2008, and 50% of the first 3% of
    compensation deferred by participants for periods prior to
    April 1, 2008). The cost of these plans totaled
    $283 million for 2009, $233 million for 2008 and
    $86 million for 2007. Our contributions are funded
    periodically during each year.

We maintained a noncontributory, defined contribution retirement
    plan which covered substantially all employees. Benefits were
    determined as a percentage of a participant’s salary and
    vest over specified periods of employee service. Benefits
    expense was $46 million for 2008 and $203 million for
    2007. There was no expense for 2009 as the noncontributory plan
    and the related participant account balances were merged into
    the contributory HCA 401(k) Plan effective April 1, 2008.

We maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan
    to provide certain retirement benefits for eligible employees.
    Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning
    eligible compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base
    and attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan
    year. Company credits to participants’ account balances
    (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon
    participants’ compensation, years of vesting service and
    certain IRS limitations related to the HCA 401(k) plan. Benefits
    expense under this plan was $26 million for 2009,
    $2 million for 2008 and $20 million for 2007. Accrued
    benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $73 million at
    December 31, 2009 and $48 million at December 31,
    2008.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
    to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the
    value of a prescribed life annuity from the combination of the
    SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the
    plan was $24 million for 2009, $20 million for 2008
    and $20 million for 2007. Accrued benefits liabilities
    under this plan totaled $152 million at December 31,
    2009 and $133 million at December 31, 2008.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from
    certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Benefits expense
    under these plans was $39 million for 2009,
    $24 million for 2008, and $27 million for 2007.
    Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled
    $115 million at December 31, 2009 and
    $142 million at December 31, 2008.

SEGMENT
    AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals
    and related health care entities. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, approximately 23%, 23%
    and 24%, respectively, of our revenues related to patients
    participating in the fee-for-service Medicare program.

Our operations are structured into three geographically
    organized groups: the Eastern Group includes 48 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Eastern United States, the Central
    Group includes 46 consolidating hospitals located in the Central
    United States and the Western Group includes 55 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Western United States. We also operate
    six consolidating hospitals in England, and these facilities are
    included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
    and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains) on sales of
    facilities, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes and
    net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We use
    adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes
    of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing
    performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an
    analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also
    serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service
    ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a
    measure of financial performance under generally accepted
    accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted
    segment EBITDA are significant components in understanding and
    assessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA
    is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company
    (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA
    Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as
    collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior
    secured notes described in Note 9.

Rule 3-16

of

Regulation S-X

under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate
    financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose
    securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral
    for any class of securities registered or being registered. We
    believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to
    Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral
    for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure
    relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating
    subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust.
    The corporate structure relationship, combined with the
    application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s
    consolidated financial statements related to HCA’s debt and
    financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial
    statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the
    consolidated

financial statements of HCA. The consolidated financial
    statements of HCA and Healthtrust present the identical amounts
    for revenues, expenses, net income, assets, liabilities, total
    stockholders’ deficit, net cash provided by operating
    activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash
    used in financing activities. Certain individual line items in
    the HCA consolidated statements of stockholders’ deficit
    and cash flows are combined into one line item in the
    Healthtrust consolidated statements of stockholder’s
    deficit and cash flows.

SUBSEQUENT
    EVENT

On January 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    vested stock options. The distribution was $17.50 per share and
    vested stock option, or approximately $1.750 billion in the
    aggregate. The distribution was paid on February 5, 2010 to
    holders of record on February 1, 2010. The distribution was
    funded using funds available under our existing senior secured
    credit facilities and approximately $100 million of cash on
    hand. Pursuant to the terms of our stock option plans, the
    holders of nonvested stock options received a $17.50 per share
    reduction to the exercise price of their share-based awards.
