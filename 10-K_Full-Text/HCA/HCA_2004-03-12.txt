INDEX



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care
services companies in the United States. At December 31,
2003, the Company operated 191 hospitals, comprised of 176
general, acute care hospitals, seven psychiatric hospitals, one
rehabilitation hospital and seven hospitals, one of which is a
rehabilitation hospital, included in joint ventures, which are
accounted for using the equity method. In addition, the Company
operated 83 freestanding surgery centers, four of which are
accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s
facilities are located in 23 states, England and
Switzerland. The terms “Company” and “HCA,”
as used herein, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless
otherwise stated or indicated by context. The term
“affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of
HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
subsidiaries are partners. The terms “facilities” or
“hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
affiliates of HCA and references to “employees” refer
to employees of affiliates of HCA.

HCA’s primary objective is to provide the
communities it serves a comprehensive array of quality health
care services in the most cost-effective manner possible.
HCA’s general, acute care hospitals typically provide a
full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties
as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology,
neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic
and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care
services are provided by HCA’s general, acute care
hospitals and through HCA’s freestanding surgery centers,
diagnostic centers, and rehabilitation facilities. HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals provide a full range of mental health care
services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and
outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January
1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993.
HCA’s principal executive offices are located at One Park
Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and its telephone number is
(615) 344-9551.

Business Strategy

HCA is committed to providing the communities it
serves high quality, cost-effective, health care while
maintaining consistency with HCA’s ethics and compliance
program, governmental regulations and guidelines, and industry
standards. As a part of this strategy, HCA’s management
focuses on the following areas:

Health Care Facilities

HCA currently owns, manages or operates
hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers,
radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive
rehabilitation and physical therapy centers and various other
facilities.

At December 31, 2003, HCA owned and operated
176 general, acute care hospitals with 41,364 licensed beds and
an additional six hospitals with 2,077 licensed beds are
operated through joint ventures, which are accounted for using
the equity method. Most of HCA’s general, acute care
hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including
inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic
services and emergency services. The general, acute care
hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient
surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology
and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical
staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up
of members of the local community.

Like most hospitals, HCA’s hospitals do not
engage in extensive medical research and education programs.
However, some of HCA’s hospitals are affiliated with
medical schools and may participate in the clinical rotation of
medical interns and residents and other education programs.

At December 31, 2003, HCA operated seven
psychiatric hospitals with 680 licensed beds. HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including
child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and
adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

Outpatient health care facilities operated by HCA
include freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers,
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
integral component of HCA’s strategy to develop
comprehensive health care networks in select communities.

In addition to providing capital resources, HCA
makes available a variety of management services to its health
care facilities, including ethics and compliance programs;
national supply contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing
contracts; accounting, financial and clinical systems;
governmental reimbursement assistance; construction planning and
coordination; information technology systems and solutions;
legal counsel; human resource services; and internal audit.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy
levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians
and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
depending on the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical,
intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of
the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various
reasons, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.



HCA receives payment for patient services from
the Federal government primarily under the Medicare program,
state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar
programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from
patients. The approximate percentages of the Company’s
patient revenues from such sources were as follows:

Medicare is a Federal program that provides
certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons
age 65 and over, some disabled persons and persons with
end-stage renal disease. Medicaid is a Federal-state program,
administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical
benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford
health care. All of HCA’s hospitals located in the United
States are certified as health care services providers for
persons covered under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are
generally significantly less than the hospitals’
established gross charges for the services provided.

HCA’s hospitals generally offer discounts
from established charges to certain group purchasers of health
care services, including Blue Cross, other private insurance
companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans.
These discount programs limit HCA’s ability to increase
revenues in response to increasing costs. (See Item 1:
Business — Competition.) Patients are generally not
responsible for the total difference between established
hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services
under Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross plans, HMOs or PPOs, but
are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or
coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such
exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance has been increasing each
year. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically
more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. In
2003, HCA implemented changes to its charity care policies, to
provide financial relief to more of its charity patients and
needs-based discounts to uninsured patients who receive
nonelective care at its hospitals. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of
Operations — Revenue/ Volume Trends.”

Medicare

Under the Medicare program, HCA receives
reimbursement under a prospective payment system
(“PPS”) for acute care hospital inpatient and
outpatient services. Under hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment
amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the
patient’s assigned diagnosis related group
(“DRG”). DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources
necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. DRG
weights represent the average resources for a given DRG relative
to the average resources for all DRGs. When the cost to treat
certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution,
providers typically receive additional “outlier”
payments. DRG payments do not consider a specific
hospital’s cost, but are adjusted for area wage
differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new
or that qualify,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient
capital costs, based on DRG weights multiplied by a
geographically adjusted Federal rate, unless a hospital
qualifies for a special exceptions payment.

DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are
recalibrated each Federal fiscal year. The index used to update
the DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives
consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and
entities outside of the health care industry in purchasing goods
and services. However, for several years the percentage
increases to the DRG rates have been lower than the percentage
increases in the costs of goods and services purchased by
hospitals. In Federal fiscal year 2003, the DRG rate increase
was market basket of 3.5% minus 0.55% (or 2.95%). For Federal
fiscal year 2004, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) set the DRG rate increase at full market
basket of 3.4%. Through recent legislation, including the



Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and
Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), Congress equalized
the DRG payment rate for urban and rural hospitals at the large
urban rate for all hospitals for discharges on or after
April 1, 2003. Further, MMA provides for DRG rate increases
for Federal fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007 at full market
basket, if data for ten patient care quality indicators is
submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(“HHS”). Those hospitals not submitting data on the
ten quality indicators will receive an increase equal to the
market basket rate minus 0.4%. HCA expects that its hospitals
will participate in the quality initiative by the Secretary of
HHS by submitting the quality data requested.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside
5.1% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases.
During Federal fiscal years 2003, 2002 and 2001, the CMS
payments for cost outlier cases exceeded the 5.1% set aside.
Outlier payments are made by CMS for those DRG cases where the
cost of the case exceeds the total DRG payments plus a fixed
threshold amount. CMS increased the threshold from $16,350 at
the end of Federal fiscal year 2001, to $21,025 for 2002, and
$33,560 for 2003. In June 2003, CMS adopted significant
regulatory changes to outlier payments. Included in the
regulatory changes were provisions to: 1) use the most
recent settled cost report to establish the hospital’s
cost-to-charge ratio, 2) eliminate the use of the statewide
average when the hospital’s cost-to-charge ratio falls
three standard deviations below the national average, and
3) permit CMS to reconcile outlier payments in the Medicare
cost report for hospitals meeting CMS defined audit criteria. As
a result of these changes, CMS set the outlier threshold at
$31,000 for Federal fiscal year 2004. The result of the prior
year increases to the outlier threshold and the final outlier
regulatory provisions will be to reduce both the number of cases
that qualify for outlier payments and the amount of payments for
qualifying outlier cases.

In order to calculate whether outlier payments
are due, the Medicare fiscal intermediary multiplies the
hospital’s billed (or gross) charges on its Medicare claim
by its cost-to-charge ratio from the most recent settled
Medicare cost report. The product of that calculation is
considered the cost of the claim. An outlier payment is made for
80% of such costs in excess of the sum of the total DRG payments
for that claim plus the fixed threshold amount ($31,000 for
Federal fiscal year 2004).

Excluding the hospitals acquired in the April
2003 Kansas City acquisition, HCA recorded $218 million,
$284 million and $240 million of revenues related to
Medicare operating outlier cases for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. These amounts represent 3.7%, 5.1% and 4.7% of
HCA’s Medicare revenues and 1.0%, 1.4% and 1.3% of
HCA’s total revenues for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
There can be no assurances that HCA will continue to receive
these levels of Medicare operating outlier payments in future
periods. Based on the Company’s estimates, future Medicare
operating outlier payments will be materially, adversely
affected by the CMS’ revisions to regulations on outlier
payments. For periods subsequent to October 1, 2003,
assuming the Company does not experience changes in Medicare
patient acuity levels, the Company estimates its monthly revenue
from Medicare operating outlier payments may be reduced by up to
$12 million.

Outpatient

On August 1, 2000, CMS began reimbursing
hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B
services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no
Part A coverage) on a PPS-basis. CMS will continue to use
existing fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and
speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic
laboratory services and nonimplantable orthotics and
prosthetics. Freestanding surgery centers are reimbursed on a
fee schedule.

All PPS-based hospital outpatient services are
classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications
(“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
The APC payment rates were updated, effective April 1,
2002, for calendar year 2002 by market basket of 3.3% minus 1.0%
(or 2.3%) and for calendar year 2003 by market basket of 3.5%.
The update for 2004 is market basket of 3.4%.



For calendar year 2002, the Medicare program set
aside 2.5% of APC payments to pay for certain approved medical
devices, drugs, and biologicals, on a pass-through basis. As
part of an update process, CMS estimated that pass-through
payments for 2002 would be considerably in excess of the 2.5%
set aside and issued final regulations that made significant
changes to pass-through device payments for services furnished
on or after April 1, 2002, including a pro-rata reduction
of 63.6%. For calendar year 2003, CMS set aside 2.3% of APC
payments to pay for certain approved medical devices, drugs, and
biologicals on a pass-through basis, and CMS did not make a
pro-rata reduction for such pass-through payments. For calendar
year 2004, CMS has set aside 1.3% of APC payments to pay for
approved medical devices, drugs, and biologicals on a
pass-through basis. CMS included the 1.0% reduction in the set
aside amount in the APC payment rates. CMS did not make a
pro-rata reduction for calendar year 2004.

Rehabilitation

PPS for rehabilitation hospitals and
rehabilitation units of hospitals was implemented for Medicare
cost reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2002. Hospitals and units with cost reporting periods beginning
prior to October 1, 2002 could elect to be paid under PPS
or a blend of PPS and the facility-specific payment rates.
Rehabilitation hospitals and units are paid under PPS for cost
reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002.
Under PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based
upon impairment, age, comorbidities and functional capability.
Inpatient rehabilitation facilities are paid a predetermined
amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix
group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients,
rural areas and high-cost outliers. For Federal fiscal years
2003 and 2004, CMS updated the PPS rate for rehabilitation
hospitals and units by market basket of 3.0% and 3.2%,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, HCA had two
rehabilitation hospitals, one of which is operated through a
joint venture, and 60 hospital rehabilitation units.

In September 2003, CMS published a proposed rule
to revise the criterion, commonly known as the
“75 percent rule,” used to classify a hospital as
an inpatient rehabilitation facility (“IRF”). The
proposed rule would also modify and expand the medical
conditions listed in the 75 percent rule regulatory
requirements as well as lower for three years the percentage of
patients required to fall within one of the specified list of
medical criteria from 75% to 65%. The public comment period
ended on November 3, 2003. CMS has yet to respond to public
comments or issue the final rule. Thus, the financial impact
that any final rule will have on rehabilitation hospitals and
units is uncertain.

Medicare fiscal intermediaries have been given
the authority to develop and implement Local Coverage
Determination (“LCD”) to determine the medical
necessity of care rendered to Medicare patients where there is
no national coverage determination. A consortium of Medicare
fiscal intermediaries has been working together to develop a
restrictive LCD on rehabilitation care. The rehabilitation LCD
is still in the drafting stage, and it is uncertain whether or
not the draft LCD will be finalized and implemented. A
restrictive rehabilitation LCD would have the potential to
significantly impact Medicare rehabilitation payments. The
financial impact to HCA of any final rehabilitation LCD is
uncertain.

Other

Payments to PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals and
units are currently based upon reasonable cost, subject to a
cost-per-discharge target (the TEFRA limits). These limits are
updated annually by a market basket index. The update to a
hospital’s target amount for its cost reporting periods
beginning in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 is market basket of 3.5%
and 3.4%, respectively. Caps had been established for the
cost-per-discharge target at the 75th percentile for each
category of PPS-exempt hospitals and units. For cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002, payments to
these PPS-exempt hospitals and units are no longer subject to
these caps. However, if a PPS-exempt hospital or unit was
subject to the cap in the cost report for the year prior to
October 1, 2002, such limitation will be included in its
future target amount. The cost-per-discharge for new hospitals
and hospital units cannot exceed 110% of the national median
target rate for hospitals in the same category.



The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget
Refinement Act of 1999 (“BBRA”) required CMS to
develop and implement budget-neutral PPS systems for both
psychiatric and long-term hospitals for cost reporting periods
beginning on or after October 1, 2002. On November 28,
2003, CMS published a proposed rule to establish a prospective
payment system for inpatient hospital services furnished in
psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of acute care
hospitals. CMS has proposed a graduated per diem prospective
payment system that would be implemented over a transition
period of three years or more. CMS has projected an
implementation date of April 1, 2004 in the proposed rule,
but also has acknowledged that the implementation date could be
delayed beyond April 1. The proposed rule was subject to public
comments until February 26, 2004. Due to the uncertainties
of the prospective payment system that will be finally adopted
by CMS, HCA is unable to predict the financial impact of such
proposed prospective payment system. As of December 31,
2003, HCA had seven psychiatric hospitals and 45 hospital
psychiatric units.

CMS has established a prospective payment system
for Medicare skilled nursing facilities under which facilities
are paid a per diem rate for virtually all covered services. The
skilled nursing facilities PPS payment rates were updated for
Federal fiscal year 2004 by market basket of 3.0% and by a
positive market basket forecast error adjustment of 3.26%. As of
December 31, 2003, HCA had 31 skilled nursing units.

Under the various Medicare prospective payment
systems, the prospective payment rates are adjusted for the area
differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area
compared to the national average wage level. Currently, CMS
defines the labor market areas based on the definitions of
Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Primary Metropolitan Statistical
Areas, and New England County Metropolitan Areas, issued by the
Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”). In June 2003,
OMB issued revised definitions of Metropolitan Statistical
Areas, and new definitions of Micropolitan Statistical Areas and
Combined Statistical Areas. CMS has stated that the earliest
usage of these new definitions would be in the Federal fiscal
year 2005 wage index. It is uncertain whether CMS will adopt the
new definitions in part or in total. The financial impact the
new OMB area wage definitions will have upon the Company is
uncertain. In addition, CMS is obligated by Section 304(c)
of Public Law 106-554 to implement an occupational mix
adjustment factor to the wage index for inpatient DRG payments
to be effective October 1, 2004 that is to account for
variation in the skill mix across hospitals. CMS is in the
process of collecting the occupational mix data from hospitals.
HCA expects that CMS will include a proposed occupational mix
adjustment factor in the inpatient DRG update rule in May 2004.
The financial impact, if any, that an occupational mix
adjustment factor will have upon the Company is uncertain.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the
Federal government and the states and are administered by states
under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are
made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with
individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than
a hospital’s cost of services. The Federal government and
many states are currently considering altering the level of
Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
eligibility that could adversely affect future levels of
Medicaid reimbursement received by HCA’s hospitals. As
permitted by law, certain states in which HCA operates have
adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund their Medicaid
programs.

Self-Pay

HCA also provides services to patients who are
not covered by insurance or by the Medicare or Medicaid
programs. HCA provides care to patients who are financially
unable to pay for the health care services they receive, and
because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts determined to
qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues. In
the first quarter of 2003, the Company announced that patients
treated at an HCA wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care who
have income at or below 200% of the Federal poverty level are
eligible for charity care, a standard HCA estimates that 70% of
its hospitals were previously using. The Federal poverty level
is established by the Federal government and is based on income
and family size. On October 1, 2003, HCA began implementing
a sliding scale of discounts for uninsured patients, treated at
HCA wholly-owned hospitals for nonelective care, with income
between 200% and 400% of the Federal poverty level.



Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare,
Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost
basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial
reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state
regulations require the submission of annual cost reports
covering the revenue, costs and expenses associated with the
services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and
Medicaid recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare
and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may
result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be
due to HCA under these reimbursement programs. These audits
often require several years to reach the final determination of
amounts due to or from HCA under these programs. Providers also
have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised
in audits of prior years’ reports.

During June 2003, HCA announced that the Company
and CMS had signed an agreement, documenting the understanding
announced in March 2002, to resolve all Medicare cost report,
home office cost statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS
(the “CMS Agreement”) for cost report periods ended
before August 1, 2001. As a result of the CMS Agreement,
HCA paid CMS $250 million in June 2003. HCA recorded a
pretax charge of $260 million ($165 million after-tax)
consisting of the accrual of $250 million for the
settlement payment and the write-off of $10 million of net
Medicare cost report receivables. This charge was recorded in
the consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

In June 2003, HCA announced that the Company and
the Civil Division of the Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) had signed agreements whereby the United
States would dismiss the various claims it had brought related
to physician relations, cost reports and wound care issues (the
“DOJ Agreement”). The DOJ Agreement received court
approval in July 2003, and HCA paid the DOJ $641 million
(including accrued interest of $10 million) during July
2003. The DOJ Agreement does not affect

qui tam

cases in
which the government has not intervened. HCA also finalized an
agreement with a negotiating team representing states that may
have claims against HCA. Under this agreement, HCA paid
$17.7 million in July 2003 to state Medicaid agencies to
resolve these claims. HCA also paid $33 million for legal
fees of the private parties. In connection with the DOJ
Agreement, HCA recorded a pretax charge of $603 million
($418 million after-tax) in 2002. The consolidated income
statement for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes a
pretax favorable change in estimate of $41 million
($25 million after-tax) related to Medicaid cost report
balances for cost report years ended December 31, 1997 and
prior.

Managed Care and Other Discounted
    Plans

Most of HCA’s hospitals offer discounts from
established charges to certain large group purchasers of health
care services, including managed care plans, Blue Cross, other
private insurance companies and employers. HCA’s admissions
reimbursed by managed care and other discounted plans decreased
from 48% for the year ended December 31, 2001, to 47% for
the year ended December 31, 2002, and to 45% for the year
ended December 31, 2003. Managed care contracts are
typically negotiated for two-year terms. While HCA has generally
received annual average price increases of seven to eight
percent from managed care payers during the previous two years,
there can be no assurance that HCA will continue to receive
increases in the future.

Hospital Utilization

HCA believes that the most important factors
relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the
quality and market position of the hospital and the number and
quality of physicians and other health care professionals
providing patient care within the facility. Generally, HCA
believes that the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is
determined by its breadth of services, level of technology,
emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and
physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the
growth in local population, local economic conditions and market
penetration of managed care programs.



The following table sets forth certain operating
statistics for HCA hospitals. Hospital operations are subject to
certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient
utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold
weather months.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local
communities served by most of HCA’s hospitals provide
services similar to those offered by HCA’s hospitals.
Additionally, in the past several years the number of
freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic centers (including
facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which
HCA operates has increased significantly. As a result, most of
HCA’s hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive
environment. The rates charged by HCA’s hospitals are
intended to be competitive



with those charged by other local hospitals for
similar services. In some cases, competing hospitals are more
established than HCA’s hospitals. Some competing hospitals
are owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others
by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments
and charitable contributions and are exempt from sales, property
and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available
to HCA’s hospitals. In addition, in certain localities
served by HCA there are large teaching hospitals that provide
highly specialized facilities, equipment and services which may
not be available at most of HCA’s hospitals. HCA is facing
increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals
and freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin
services. Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from
areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, HCA’s
psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional
hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute
care hospitals.

HCA’s strategies are designed to ensure
HCA’s hospitals are competitive. HCA believes that its
hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many
factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and
retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other
health care professionals, location, breadth of services,
technology offered and prices charged. HCA is increasing its
focus on operating outpatient services with improved
accessibility and more convenient service for patients and
increased predictability and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the
competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of
physicians affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may
at any time terminate their affiliation with a hospital operated
by HCA, the Company’s hospitals seek to retain physicians
with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs
and to attract other qualified physicians. HCA believes that
physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the
quality and scope of services it renders to patients and
physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the
location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s
facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, HCA strives to
maintain quality facilities, equipment, employees and services
for physicians and their patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position
of a hospital is management’s ability to negotiate service
contracts with purchasers of group health care services. Managed
care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital
services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established
gross charges. In addition, employers and traditional health
insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through
negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and
discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals
compete for service contracts with group health care services
purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic
location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical
staff and convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts
with managed care organizations varies from community to
community depending on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws,
which place limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand
hospital services and facilities, make capital expenditures and
otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect
of restricting competition. In those states which have no CON
laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before
they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the
form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more
prevalent. See Item 1: Business — Regulation and
Other Factors.

HCA, and the health care industry as a whole,
face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care
while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for
patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future
legislation, regulations and interpretations and competitive
contracting for provider services by private and government
payers remain ongoing challenges. These challenges may require
changes in HCA’s operations in the future.

Admissions and average lengths of stay continue
to be negatively affected by payer-required pre-admission
authorization, utilization review and by payer pressure to
maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery
services for less acutely ill patients. Increased competition,
admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to
continue. To meet these challenges, HCA intends to expand many
of its facilities or acquire or construct new facilities to
better enable the provision of a comprehensive array of



outpatient services, offer discounts to private
payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and offer new or
expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and
    Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation
are subject to numerous Federal, state and local regulations
relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel,
operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate
records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with
building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are
subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other
authorities to assure continued compliance with the various
standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. HCA
believes that its health care facilities are properly licensed
under applicable state laws. All of HCA’s general, acute
care hospitals are certified for participation in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs and are accredited by the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (“Joint
Commission”). Certain of HCA’s psychiatric hospitals
do not participate in these programs. If any facility were to
lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its
certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the
facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the
Medicare and Medicaid programs. Management believes that
HCA’s facilities are in substantial compliance with current
applicable Federal, state, local and independent review body
regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure,
certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in
order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for HCA to
make changes in its facilities, equipment, personnel and
services.

Certificates of Need

In some states where HCA operates hospitals, the
construction or expansion of health care facilities, the
acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be
subject to review by and prior approval of state regulatory
agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the
reviewing state agency to determine the public need for
additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
change ownership.

State Rate Review

Some states where HCA operates hospitals have
adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for
hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and
indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected
HCA’s results of operations.

Utilization Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed
to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and
Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and
are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are
properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a
sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be
reviewed by quality improvement organizations to assess the
appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and
discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of DRG
classifications and the appropriateness of cases of
extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality improvement
organizations may deny payment for services provided, may assess
fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department
of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider,
which is in substantial noncompliance with the appropriate
standards, be excluded from participating in the Medicare
program. Most nongovernmental managed care organizations also
require utilization review.

Federal Health Care Program
    Regulations

Participation in any Federal health care program,
including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily
regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to
substantially comply with the numerous



conditions of participation in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
hospital’s participation in the Federal health care
programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
or both.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
“Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
from directly or indirectly, soliciting, receiving, offering or
paying, any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
or orders for services, or items covered by a Federal health
care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly.
Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a
criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or
imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of
the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Federal
health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

The Office of Inspector General at the Department
of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), among other
regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. In order to provide guidance to health care
providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the
arrangements or transactions violate the Anti-kickback Statute
or other Federal health care laws. The OIG has identified
several incentive arrangements, which, if accompanied by
inappropriate intent, constitute suspect practices, including:
(a) payment of any incentive by the hospital each time a
physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of
free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in
facilities usually located close to the hospital,
(c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing,
nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a
physician’s office staff in areas such as management
techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which
provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a
predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or
loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to
the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a
physician’s travel and expenses for conferences,
(h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance
plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician,
(i) payment for services (which may include consultations
at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties
by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from
physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, or
(k) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, the
practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
the physician’s efforts. The OIG has encouraged persons
having information about hospitals who offer the above types of
incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published
safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities
that are deemed protected from prosecution under the
Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions
and safe harbors for various activities, including the
following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management
contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
and referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that
conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe
harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business
arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. Such
conduct and business arrangements, however, may lead to
increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.
Although the Company believes that its arrangements with
physicians have been structured to comply with current law and
available interpretations, there can be no assurance that
regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these
financial arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute
or other applicable laws. This determination could subject the
Company to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including
criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care
programs.



Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision
commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law
effectively prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and
Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their
immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these
entities provide certain designated health services that are
reimbursable by Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient
hospital services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include
denial of payment, refunding amounts received for services
provided pursuant to prohibited referrals, civil monetary
penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited service provided,
and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The
statute also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a
circumvention scheme. There are exceptions to the self-referral
prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements
between physicians and providers, including employment
contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. There is also an
exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire
hospital, as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital
department.

In January 2001, CMS issued regulations, intended
to clarify parts of the Stark Law and some of the exceptions to
it. These regulations are considered the first phase of a
two-phase process, with the remaining regulations to be
published at an unknown future date. The phase one regulations
generally became effective January 4, 2002. However, CMS
delayed until July 7, 2004 the effective date of
regulations related to whether percentage-based compensation is
deemed to be “set in advance” for purposes of
exceptions to the Stark Law. The Company cannot predict the
final form that these regulations will take or the effect that
the regulations will have on its operations.

Congress recently passed legislation that
modifies the hospital ownership exception to the Stark Law by
creating an 18-month moratorium on allowing physicians to own
interests in new specialty hospitals. During the moratorium, HHS
is required to conduct an analysis of specialty hospitals,
including quality of care provided and physician referral
patterns to these facilities. MedPac will study cost and payment
issues related to specialty hospitals. The moratorium applies to
hospitals that primarily or exclusively treat cardiac,
orthopedic or surgical conditions or any other specialized
category of patients or cases designated by regulation, unless
the hospitals were in operation or development before
November 18, 2003, do not increase the number of physician
investors, and meet certain other requirements. It is uncertain
how CMS will interpret this legislation, what recommendations
HHS will make regarding specialty hospitals, or whether
additional changes will be made to the hospital ownership
exception.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which HCA operates also have laws
that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals
similar to the Anti-kickback Statute and self-referral
legislation similar to the Stark Law. The scope of these state
laws is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the
source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for
their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically
provide for criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of
facility licensure.

HIPAA and BBA-97

The Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the
scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal
provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all
health benefit programs. HIPAA also added a prohibition against
incentives intended to influence decisions by Medicare
beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive
services. In addition, HIPAA created new enforcement mechanisms
to combat fraud and abuse, including the Medicare Integrity
Program, and an incentive program under which individuals can
receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud
and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of
Medicare funds. Federal enforcement officials now have the
ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors,
officers and managing employees associated with business
entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the
officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud.
HIPAA was followed by the Balanced Budge Act of 1997
(“BBA-97”), which created additional fraud and abuse
provisions, including civil penalties for contracting



with an individual or entity that the provider
knows or should know is excluded from a Federal health care
program.

Other Fraud and Abuse
    Provisions

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and
civil penalties for making false claims and statements to
Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited
to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting
actual services rendered in order to obtain higher
reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services, and
cost report fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed
for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure
to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements,
and offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid
beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider. Like the
Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Careful
and accurate coding of claims for reimbursement, as well as
accurately preparing cost reports, must be performed to avoid
liability.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State
    Laws

A factor affecting the health care industry is
the use of the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular,
actions brought by individuals on the government’s behalf
under the False Claims Act’s

“qui tam,”

or
whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow
private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government
alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law
to be liable under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be
required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the
government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and
$11,000 for each separate false claim. There are many potential
bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often
arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for
reimbursement to the Federal government. The False Claims Act
defines the term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple
negligence will not give rise to liability under the False
Claims Act, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its
truth or falsity constitutes a “knowing” submission
under the False Claims Act and, therefore, will qualify for
liability.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the Federal
government have taken the position that providers who allegedly
have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute
and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the
False Claims Act. A number of states in which HCA operates have
adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own
whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a
civil lawsuit in state court.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and
    Privacy Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of
HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission
standards for certain health care claims and payment
transactions submitted or received electronically. These
provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the
health care industry. HHS has issued regulations implementing
the HIPAA Administrative Simplification Provisions and
compliance with these regulations became mandatory for
HCA’s facilities on October 16, 2003. HHS has agreed
to accept noncompliant Medicare claims, for an unspecified time,
to assist providers that are not yet able to process compliant
transactions. However, this extension may be terminated by HHS
and is not binding on private payers. HCA believes that the cost
of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position or results of operations.

HIPAA also requires HHS to adopt standards to
protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable
health-related information. HHS released regulations containing
privacy standards in December 2000 and published revisions to
the regulations in August 2002. Compliance with these
regulations became mandatory on April 14, 2003. The privacy
regulations regulate the use and disclosure of individually
identifiable health-related information, whether communicated
electronically, on paper or orally. The regulations also provide
patients with significant new rights related to understanding
and controlling how their health information is used or
disclosed. HHS released security regulations on
February 20, 2003. The security regulations will become
mandatory on April 20, 2005 and will require health care
providers to



implement administrative, physical and technical
practices to protect the security of individually identifiable
health information that is maintained or transmitted
electronically. The privacy regulations and security
regulations, when fully implemented, could impose significant
costs on HCA’s facilities in order to comply with these
standards.

Violations of HIPAA could result in civil
penalties of up to $25,000 per type of violation in each
calendar year and criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per
violation. In addition, there are numerous legislative and
regulatory initiatives at the Federal and state levels
addressing patient privacy concerns. Facilities will continue to
remain subject to any Federal or state privacy-related laws that
are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under
HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties.

EMTALA

All of HCA’s hospitals are subject to the
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”). This Federal law requires any hospital
that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an
appropriate medical screening examination of every person who
presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment
and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical
condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an
appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can
handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize
emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a
patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe
penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or
appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital
delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the
patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of
EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured
patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that
suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another
hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit
against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover
situations in which patients do not actually present to a
hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency
examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus,
generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency
medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned
ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. The government also
has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA
violations actively in the future. The Company believes
HCA’s hospitals operate in substantial compliance with
EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/ Fee
    Splitting

Some of the states in which HCA operates have
laws that prohibit corporations and other entities from
employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or
that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or
fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that
are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to,
or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical
products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these
restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal
penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and
the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These
statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have
seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has
focused in recent years on the hospital industry. While HCA is
currently not aware of any material investigations of the
Company, it is possible that governmental entities could
initiate investigations or litigation in the future at
facilities operated by HCA and that such matters could result in
significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also
possible that HCA’s executives and managers could be
included in governmental investigations or litigation or named
as defendants in private litigation.

The Company’s substantial Medicare, Medicaid
and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of
its operations. The Company continues to monitor all aspects of
its business and has developed a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
Federal



guidelines and industry standards. Because the
law in this area is complex and constantly evolving,
governmental investigations or litigation may result in
interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices,
including the Company’s.

Health Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in
the United States and continues to attract much legislative
interest and public attention. In recent years, various
legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in
Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major
changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the
state level. Many states have enacted, or are considering
enacting, measures designed to reduce their Medicaid
expenditures and change private health care insurance. Most
states, including the states in which HCA operates, have applied
for and been granted Federal waivers from current Medicaid
regulations to allow them to serve some or all of their Medicaid
participants through managed care providers.

Compliance Program and Corporate Integrity
    Agreement

HCA maintains a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
Federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is
intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory
issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of
complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the
ethics and compliance program, HCA provides annual ethics and
compliance training to its employees and encourages all
employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an
ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics
line.

In January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year
Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG.
The CIA is structured to assure the Federal government of
HCA’s overall Federal health care program compliance and
specifically covers DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and
physician relations. The CIA also included testing for
outpatient laboratory billing in 2001, which was replaced with
skilled nursing facilities billing in 2003. Under the CIA, HCA
has an affirmative obligation to report potential violations of
applicable Federal heath care laws and regulations and has,
pursuant to this obligation, reported a number of potential
technical violations of the Stark and EMTALA laws. This
obligation could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory
authorities. Breach of the CIA could subject HCA to substantial
monetary penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the
Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Conversion Legislation

Many states have enacted or are considering
enacting laws affecting the conversion, or sale, of
not-for-profit hospitals. These laws, in general, include
provisions relating to attorney general approval, advance
notification and community involvement. In addition, state
attorneys general in states without specific conversion
legislation may exercise authority over these transactions based
upon existing law. In many states there has been an increased
interest in the oversight of not-for-profit conversions. The
adoption of conversion legislation and the increased review of
not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit HCA’s ability
to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.

Revenue Ruling 98-15

In March 1998, the IRS issued guidance regarding
the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and
not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax ruling, the IRS
has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the
tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit
entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat
joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to
them. HCA is continuing to review the impact of the tax ruling
on its existing joint ventures and the development of future
joint ventures, and is consulting with its joint venture
partners and tax advisers to develop appropriate courses of
action. In January 2001, a not-for-profit entity which
participates in a joint venture with HCA filed a refund suit in
Federal District Court seeking to recover taxes, interest and
penalties assessed by the IRS in connection with the IRS’s
proposed revocation of the not-for-profit entity’s
tax-exempt status. In March 2004, a Federal



court granted the entity’s claim for refund
and upheld its tax-exempt status. The IRS has 30 days in
which to appeal.

The tax ruling has limited development of joint
ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts
regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a
not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture
income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit
joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or
require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures
with not-for-profits.

Antitrust Laws

The Federal government and most states have
enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct
deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing,
concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price
discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors
and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
competition. Violations of Federal or state antitrust laws can
result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. HCA
believes it is in compliance with such Federal and state laws,
but there can be no assurance that a review of HCA’s
practices by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in
a determination that could adversely affect HCA’s
operations.

Environmental Matters

HCA is subject to various Federal, state and
local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of
materials into the environment. Management does not believe that
HCA will be required to expend any material amounts in order to
comply with these laws and regulations or that compliance will
materially affect its capital expenditures, results of
operations or financial condition.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, HCA is
subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary
course of business. Through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary,
HCA insures a substantial portion of its professional liability
risks. HCA’s facilities are insured by the insurance
subsidiary for losses of up to $25 million per occurrence.
Professional liability risks above a $10 million retention
per occurrence for 2002 were reinsured with unrelated commercial
carriers. HCA also maintains professional liability insurance
with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
amounts insured by its insurance subsidiary. HCA and its
insurance subsidiary maintain reserves for professional
liability risks that totaled $1.477 billion, net of
reinsurance recoverables, at December 31, 2003. Management
considers such reserves, which are based on actuarially
determined estimates, to be adequate for such liability risks.
HCA maintains its directors and officers, property and other
typical coverages with unrelated commercial carriers.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2003, HCA had approximately
188,000 employees, including approximately 54,000 part-time
employees. References herein to “employees” refer to
employees of affiliates of HCA. HCA is subject to various state
and Federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other
terms and conditions relating to employment. Employees at 17
hospitals are represented by various labor unions. HCA considers
its employee relations to be satisfactory. HCA’s hospitals
are experiencing an increase in union organizational activity,
particularly in California. However, the Company does not expect
such efforts to materially affect its future operations.
HCA’s hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced
labor costs rising faster than the general inflation rate. In
some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability
has become a significant operating issue to health care
providers. To address this challenge, HCA has implemented
several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting,
compensation programs and productivity. This shortage may also
require an increase in the utilization of more expensive
temporary personnel.

Licensed physicians who have been accepted to the
medical staff of individual hospitals staff HCA’s
hospitals. With certain exceptions, physicians generally are not
employees of HCA’s hospitals. However, some physicians
provide services in HCA’s hospitals under contracts which
generally describe a term of service,



provide and establish the duties and obligations
of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain
performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any
licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff
of any of HCA’s hospitals, but the hospital’s medical
staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in
accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve
acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of
HCA’s hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of
other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with a
hospital at any time.

Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following
risks were to occur, HCA’s business, financial position,
results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be
materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed
immaterial by HCA, may also constrain its business and
operations. In either case, the trading price of HCA’s
common stock could decline and stockholders could lose all or
part of their investment.

HCA Has Been The Subject Of Governmental
    Investigations, Claims And Litigation That Have Resulted In
    Significant Charges And Ongoing Reporting Obligations.

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the
subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating
to its business practices. The investigations were concluded
through a series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In
January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG.

HCA remains the subject of a December 1997 formal
order of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

If HCA was found to be in violation of Federal or
state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or
breach of the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such
sanctions or expenses could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s financial position, results of operation and
liquidity.

If HCA Fails To Comply With Extensive Laws And
    Government Regulations, It Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required
    To Make Significant Changes To Its Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply
with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the Federal,
state and local government levels relating to, among other
things:



Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute
and the Stark Law. These laws impact the relationships that HCA
may have with physicians and other referral sources. HCA has a
variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer
patients to its hospitals, including employment contracts,
leases and professional service agreements. HCA also provides
financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to
recruit physicians into the communities served by its hospitals.
The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline
practices that are deemed protected from prosecution under the
Anti-kickback Statute. A number of HCA’s current financial
relationships with physicians and other referral sources do not
qualify for safe harbor protection under the Anti-kickback
Statute. While the Company endeavors to comply with the
applicable safe harbors, certain of the Company’s current
arrangements, including joint ventures, do not qualify for safe
harbor protection. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean
that the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback
Statute, but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny.
HCA cannot assure that practices that are outside of a safe
harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute.

HCA’s financial relationships with
physicians and their immediate family members must comply with
the Stark Law by meeting an exception. HCA attempts to structure
its relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the
regulations implementing the exceptions, some of which are still
under review, are detailed and complex, and HCA cannot assure
that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

If HCA fails to comply with the Anti-kickback
Statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations,
it could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal
penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of its licenses
to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more
facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and
other Federal and state health care programs. See Item 1:
Business — Regulation and Other Factors.

Because many of these laws and regulations are
relatively new, HCA does not always have the benefit of
significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject
HCA’s current or past practices to allegations of
impropriety or illegality or could require HCA to make changes
in its facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital
expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination
that HCA has violated these laws, or the public announcement
that it is being investigated for possible violations of these
laws, could have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition, results of operations or prospects and
HCA’s business reputation could suffer significantly. In
addition, HCA is unable to predict whether other legislation or
regulations at the Federal or state level will be adopted, what
form such legislation or regulations may take or their impact.

HCA Is Subject To Uncertainties Regarding
    Health Care Reform.

In recent years, an increasing number of
legislative initiatives have been introduced or proposed in
Congress and in state legislatures that would result in major
changes in the health care system, either nationally or at the
state level. Among the proposals that have been introduced are
price controls on hospitals, insurance market reforms to
increase the availability of group health insurance to small
businesses, requirements that all businesses offer health
insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a
government health insurance plan or plans that would cover all
citizens and increase payments by beneficiaries. HCA cannot
predict whether any of the above proposals, or any other
proposals, will be adopted, and if adopted, no assurance can be
given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial position or
results of operations.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For
    Patients From Other Hospitals And Health Care
    Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive
and competition among hospitals and other health care providers
for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other
hospitals in the local communities served by most of HCA’s
hospitals provide services similar to those offered by
HCA’s hospitals. In addition, the number of freestanding
specialty hospitals and surgery and diagnostic centers in the
geographic areas in which HCA operates has increased
significantly. As a result, most of HCA’s hospitals operate
in an increasingly competitive environment. Some of the
hospitals that compete with HCA’s hospitals are owned by
govern-



mental agencies or not-for-profit corporations
supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can
finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt
basis. HCA is facing increasing competition from physician-owned
specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery centers for market
share in high margin services and for quality physicians and
personnel. If HCA’s competitors are better able to attract
patients, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain
favorable managed care contracts at their facilities, HCA may
experience a decline in patient volume. See Item 1:
Business — Competition.

HCA’s Performance Depends On Its Ability
    To Recruit And Retain Quality Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of
hospital admissions and, therefore, the success of HCA’s
hospitals depends, in part, on the number and quality of the
physicians on the medical staffs of its hospitals, the admitting
practices of those physicians and maintaining good relations
with those physicians. Physicians are generally not employees of
the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets
that HCA serves, most physicians have admitting privileges at
other hospitals in addition to HCA’s hospitals. Such
physicians may terminate their affiliation with HCA hospitals at
any time. If HCA is unable to provide adequate support personnel
or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities
that meet the needs of those physicians, they may be discouraged
from referring patients to HCA facilities, admissions may
decrease and HCA’s operating performance may decline.

HCA’s Hospitals Face Competition For
    Staffing, Which May Increase Its Labor Costs And Reduce
    Profitability.

HCA’s operations are dependent on the
efforts, abilities and experience of its management and medical
support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab
technicians, as well as its physicians. HCA competes with other
health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified
management and support personnel responsible for the daily
operations of each of its hospitals, including nurses and other
nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the
availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has
become a significant operating issue to health care providers.
This shortage may require HCA to continue to enhance wages and
benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support
personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel. HCA
also depends on the available labor pool of semiskilled and
unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates.
If HCA’s labor costs increase, it may not be able to raise
rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant
percentage of HCA’s revenues consist of fixed, prospective
payments, its ability to pass along increased labor costs is
constrained. HCA’s failure to recruit and retain qualified
management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to
control its labor costs could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s results of operations.

Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce
    HCA’s Revenues.

A significant portion of HCA’s patient
volumes are derived from government health care programs,
principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are highly regulated
and subject to frequent and substantial changes. HCA derived
approximately 51% of its admissions from the Medicare and
Medicaid programs in 2003. In recent years, legislative changes,
have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions
in levels of payments to health care providers for certain
services under these government programs.

In 2003, CMS adopted significant changes to the
methodology for determining Medicare outlier payments that will
result in a significant reduction in outlier payments the
Company receives. In addition, a number of states are
experiencing budget problems and have adopted, or are
considering, legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid
expenditures. States have also adopted, or are considering,
legislation designed to provide universal coverage and
additional care. Such legislation includes reducing coverage and
program eligibility, enrolling Medicaid recipients in managed
care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help
finance or expand the states’ Medicaid systems. Hospital
operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under
significant pressure because of deterioration in pricing
flexibility and payer mix, and growth in operating expenses in
excess of the increase in PPS payments under the Medicare
program. Future legislation or other changes in the
administration or interpretation of government health programs
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operations of HCA.



Demands Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely
    Affect HCA’s Growth In Revenues.

HCA’s ability to negotiate favorable
contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care
plans, significantly affects the revenues and operating results
of most of its hospitals. Admissions derived from managed care
and other discounted plans accounted for approximately 45% of
HCA’s admissions in 2003. Nongovernment payers, including
managed care payers, increasingly are demanding discounted fee
structures. Reductions in price increases or the amounts
received from managed care, commercial insurance or other payers
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position
and results of operations of HCA.

The Growth Of Uninsured And Self-Pay Accounts
    And A Deterioration In The Collectability Of These Accounts
    Could Adversely Affect HCA’s Results Of
    Operations.

The primary collection risks of the
Company’s accounts receivable relate to the uninsured
patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary
insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable
agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and
copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful
accounts relates primarily to these “self-pay” amounts
due from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts
is based upon management’s assessment of historical and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. At
December 31, 2003 the Company’s allowance for doubtful
accounts, as a percentage of self-pay accounts, was
approximately 88%. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 10.1% of
revenues compared to 8.0% of revenues in 2002. For the fourth
quarter of 2003, the provision for doubtful accounts was 11.4%
of revenues compared to 8.6% of revenues in the fourth quarter
of 2002.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted
in an increasing proportion of accounts receivable being
comprised of uninsured accounts and a deterioration in the
collectability of these accounts will adversely affect
HCA’s collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and
results of operations.

Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services
    May Reduce HCA’s Revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payers designed
to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to
as “utilization review,” have affected and are
expected to continue to affect HCA’s facilities.
Utilization review entails the review of the admission and
course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans.
Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy
rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required
preadmission authorization and utilization review and by payer
pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care
delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to
impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue.
Although HCA is unable to predict the effect these changes will
have on its operations, significant limits on the scope of
services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could
have a material adverse effect on HCA’s business, financial
position and results of operations.

HCA’s Shared Services And Other
    Initiatives May Not Achieve Anticipated Efficiencies.

HCA implemented shared services initiatives
designed to increase revenue, accelerate cash flows and reduce
operating costs by consolidating hospitals’ back-office
functions such as billing, collections and purchasing. HCA has
developed ten regional patient account services
(“PAS”) centers located in the Company’s major
regional markets. The PASs provide the business office services
that were previously performed in each facility and provide a
setting to better utilize experienced personnel, share best
practices and handle volumes of transactions more efficiently
through stratification and specialization. HCA has implemented
supply improvement and distribution programs that include
consolidating purchasing functions regionally, combining
warehouses and developing division-based procurement programs.
HCA has expended significant sums to build and implement these
shared services initiatives. There can be no assurance that HCA
will be able to realize the anticipated efficiencies from these
initiatives.

During the second quarter of 2003, HCA announced
plans to discontinue activities associated with the development
of a patient accounting software system resulting in a pretax
charge of $130 million. HCA had



estimated that the patient accounting project
would have required total expenditures of approximately
$400 million to develop and install. The Company is now
redirecting efforts in this area to the implementation of
enhancements to its existing patient accounting system. HCA is
also in the process of implementing projects to replace its
payroll and human resources information systems. Management
estimates that the payroll and human resources system projects
will require total expenditures of approximately
$332 million to develop and install. At December 31,
2003, project-to-date costs incurred were $212 million
($137 million of the costs incurred have been capitalized
and $75 million have been expensed). Management expects
that the system development, testing, data conversion and
installation will continue through 2006. There can be no
assurance that the development and implementation of those
systems will not be delayed, that the total cost will not be
significantly more than currently anticipated, that business
processes will not be interrupted during implementation or that
HCA will realize the expected benefits and efficiencies from the
developed products.

HCA’s Operations Could Be Impaired By A
    Failure Of The Company’s Information Systems.

The performance of HCA’s sophisticated
information technology and systems is critical to HCA’s
business operations. In addition to HCA’s shared services
initiatives, HCA’s information systems are essential to a
number of critical areas of the Company’s business
operations, including:

Any system failure that causes an interruption in
service or availability of HCA’s systems could adversely
affect operations or delay the collection of revenue. Even
though HCA has implemented network security measures, the
Company’s servers are vulnerable to computer viruses,
break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering.
The occurrence of any of these events could result in
interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data, or
cessations in the availability of systems, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on the financial position and
results of operations of HCA and harm HCA’s business
reputation.

State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or
    Expansion Of Hospitals Could Impair HCA’s Ability To
    Operate And Expand Its Operations.

Some states require health care providers to
obtain prior approval, known as a certificate of need or CON,
for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care
facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make
changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these
states consider the need for additional or expanded health care
facilities or services. HCA currently operates hospitals in a
number of states with CON laws. The failure to obtain any
requested CON could impair HCA’s ability to operate or
expand operations.

HCA’s Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated
    In Florida And Texas, Which Makes The Company Sensitive To
    Regulatory, Economic And Competitive Changes In Those
    States.

HCA operated 191 hospitals at December 31,
2003, and 77 of those hospitals are located in Florida and
Texas. This situation makes HCA particularly sensitive to
regulatory, economic, and competition changes in those states.
Any material change in the current payment programs or
regulatory, economic or competitive conditions in those states
could have a disproportionate effect on the Company’s
overall business results.

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims
    By The IRS.

HCA is currently contesting claims for income
taxes and related interest proposed by the IRS for prior years
aggregating approximately $381 million through
December 31, 2003. The disputed items include the



timing of recognition of certain patient service
revenues in 2000, the amount of insurance expense deducted in
1999 and 2000, and the amount of gain or loss recognized on the
divestiture of certain business units in 1998. During 2004, the
IRS began an examination of HCA’s 2001 through 2002 Federal
income tax returns. HCA is presently unable to estimate the
amount of any additional income tax and interest that the IRS
may claim upon completion of this examination or any future
examinations that may be initiated by the IRS. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — IRS
Disputes”.

HCA May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims
    Brought Against Its Facilities.

HCA is subject to litigation relating to its
business practices including claims and legal actions by
patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging
malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. See
Item 3: Legal Proceedings. Many of these actions involve
large claims and significant defense costs. HCA insures a
substantial portion of its professional and general liability
risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary, in amounts management
believes are sufficient to cover claims arising out of the
operation of HCA’s facilities. HCA’s wholly-owned
insurance subsidiary historically has entered into certain
reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the
reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the
subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do
not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If
payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are
not covered by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet
their obligations, the results of operations and financial
position of HCA could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations In Operating Results And Other
    Factors May Result In Decreases In HCA’s Stock
    Price.

The stock markets have experienced extreme
volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating
performance of particular companies. These broad market
fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of
HCA’s common stock. There may be significant volatility in
the market price of HCA’s common stock. If HCA is unable to
operate its hospitals as profitably as it has in the past,
investors could sell shares of HCA’s common stock when it
becomes apparent that the expectations of the market may not be
realized, resulting in a decrease in the market price of
HCA’s common stock.

In addition to HCA’s operating results, the
operating results of other hospital companies, changes in
financial estimates or recommendations by analysts, changes in
government health care programs, governmental investigations and
litigation, speculation in the press or investment community,
the possible affects of war, terrorist and other hostilities,
adverse weather conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses,
changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial
markets, or other developments affecting the health care
industry, could cause the market price of HCA’s common
stock to fluctuate substantially.

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number
of hospitals (general, acute care and psychiatric), directly or
indirectly, owned and operated by the Company as of
December 31, 2003:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above
table, HCA, directly or indirectly operates 83 freestanding
surgery centers. HCA also operates medical office buildings in
conjunction with some of its hospitals. These office buildings
are primarily occupied by physicians who practice at HCA’s
hospitals.

HCA owns and maintains its headquarters in
approximately 902,000 square feet of space in six office
buildings in Nashville, Tennessee. In addition to the
headquarters in Nashville, HCA owns and maintains service
centers related to the Company’s shared services
initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
which the Company operates hospitals.

HCA’s headquarters, hospitals and other
facilities are suitable for their respective uses and are, in
general, adequate for HCA’s present needs. HCA’s
properties are subject to various Federal, state and local
statutes and ordinances regulating their operation. Management
does not believe that compliance with such statutes and
ordinances will materially affect HCA’s financial position
or results from operations.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious
industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and
regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be
instituted or asserted against the Company. The resolution of
any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings
could materially, adversely affect HCA’s results of
operations and financial position in a given period.

Government Investigation, Claims and
Litigation

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the
subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating
to its business practices. The investigations were concluded
through a series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In
January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG.

HCA remains the subject of a December 1997 formal
order of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

If HCA was found to be in violation of Federal or
state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or
breach of the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such
sanctions or expenses could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s financial position, results of operation and
liquidity.

Lawsuits

Shareholder Derivative and Class Action
    Complaints Filed in the U.S. District Courts

During the April 1997 to October 1997 period,
numerous securities class action and derivative lawsuits were
filed in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Tennessee against the Company and certain of its
current and former directors, officers and/or employees.

In August 1997, the court entered an order
consolidating the securities class action claims into a
single-captioned case,

Morse, Sidney, et al. v. R.
Clayton McWhorter, et al.,

Case No. 3-97-0370. The
court administratively closed all of the other individual
securities class action lawsuits. The consolidated Morse lawsuit
is a purported class action seeking the certification of a class
of persons or entities who acquired the Company’s common
stock from April 9, 1994 to September 9, 1997. The
consolidated lawsuit was brought against the Company, Richard
Scott, David Vandewater, Thomas Frist, Jr., R. Clayton
McWhorter, Carl E. Reichardt, Magdalena Averhoff, M.D., T.
Michael Long and Donald S. MacNaughton. The lawsuit alleges,
among other things, that the defendants committed violations of
the Federal securities laws by materially inflating the
Company’s revenues and earnings through a number of
practices, including upcoding, maintaining reserve cost reports,
disseminating false and misleading statements, cost shifting,
illegal reimbursements, improper billing, unbundling and
violating various Medicare laws. The lawsuit seeks damages,
costs and expenses.

During 2003, HCA reached an understanding with
attorneys representing shareholder groups to settle class action
securities lawsuits originally filed in 1997. Under the terms of
the settlement, a $49.5 million settlement fund has been
established to pay class members based on their individual
claims. HCA also reached an understanding with its insurance
carriers under which the insurers will pay the majority of the
settlement amount. Final approval of the settlement was granted
by the court on February 4, 2004.

General Liability and Other Claims

The matter of

Rocky Mountain Medical Center,
Inc. v. Northern Utah Healthcare Corporation, d/b/a St.
Mark’s Hospital,

Case No. 000906627, was filed in
the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County, Utah on
August 22, 2000 with a request for injunctive relief and
damages under Utah antitrust law. Specific counts in the
complaint include illegal boycott, unreasonable restraint of
trade, attempt to monopolize and interference with prospective
economic relations. At issue are St. Mark’s Hospital’s
contracts with certain managed care organizations. The court
denied the plaintiff’s request for a preliminary
injunction. Both parties



filed cross-motions for summary judgment and both
motions were denied in December 2001. Discovery has concluded.
On November 10, 2003, the Company filed a renewed motion
for summary judgment. The court granted the Company’s
motion for summary judgment in full. On February 25, 2004,
the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal.

Two law firms representing groups of health
insurers have approached the Company and alleged that the
Company’s affiliates may have overcharged or otherwise
improperly billed the health insurers for various types of
medical care during the time frame from 1994 through 1997. The
Company is engaged in discussions with these insurers, but no
litigation has been filed. The Company is unable to determine if
litigation will be filed, and if filed, what damages would be
asserted.

The Company intends to pursue the defense of
these actions and prosecution of its counterclaims and
third-party claims vigorously.

The Company is a party to certain proceedings
relating to claims for income taxes and related interest in the
United States Tax Court, the United States Court of Federal
Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit. For a description of those proceedings, see
Note 6 — Income Taxes in the notes to
consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to claims and suits
arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for
personal injuries or for wrongful restriction of, or
interference with, physicians’ staff privileges. In certain
of these actions the claimants have asked for punitive damages
against the Company, which may not be covered by insurance. In
the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these
pending claims and legal proceedings will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or
financial position.

2003 Operations Summary

The general economic environment for the general,
acute care hospital industry during 2003 was negatively impacted
by the following trends: a reduction in the growth rate of
inpatient admissions, increasing competition from specialty
facilities for cardiac, orthopedic and outpatient surgery
services, and rising levels of uninsured and patient due
accounts, and the resulting increase in the provision for
doubtful accounts.



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

2003 Operations Summary (Continued)

During 2003, same facility admissions increased
0.6%, compared to 2.5% and 2.7% increases attained during 2002
and 2001, respectively. Same facility outpatient surgeries
declined 3.0% during 2003, compared to an increase of 2.2% in
2002 and a decrease of 1.2% in 2001. The provision for doubtful
accounts increased to 10.1% of revenues in 2003 from 8.0% and
7.7% of revenues for 2002 and 2001, respectively. The difference
between 10.1% and 8.0% of 2003 revenues is $462 million.
Management expects these negative volume and bad debt trends to
remain significant challenges for HCA in 2004.

During 2003, HCA was able to manage salaries and
benefits and other operating expenses effectively and
adjustments were made to react timely to the volume trends.
Salaries and benefits were reduced to 39.8% of revenues in 2003
compared to 40.3% and 40.5% of revenues in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Other operating expenses were reduced to 16.8% of
revenues in 2003 compared to 16.9% and 18.1% of revenues in 2002
and 2001, respectively.

During 2003, the remaining aspects of the
governmental investigations into HCA’s business practices
that began in 1997 were concluded. Over the past five years, HCA
paid approximately $2 billion in settlement payments to the
applicable government agencies and for legal and investigation
related costs. The investigations also demanded significant time
requirements for management and numerous employees over the past
years. Management is pleased that these investigations have been
concluded.

While the Company has faced both operational and
investigation related challenges during the past three years,
management believes that it is important to recognize that HCA
has generated cash provided by operating activities of
$2.166 billion, $2.750 billion and $1.413 billion
during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the
subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating
to its business practices. The governmental investigations
included activities for certain entities for periods prior to
their acquisition by the Company and activities for certain
entities that have been divested. As part of the investigations,
the United States intervened in a number of

qui tam

actions brought by private parties.

The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In December
2000, HCA entered into a Plea Agreement with the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and
various U.S. Attorneys’ offices (the “Plea
Agreement”) and a Civil and Administrative Settlement
Agreement with the Civil Division of the DOJ (the “Civil
Agreement”). The agreements resolved all Federal criminal
issues outstanding against HCA and certain issues involving
Federal civil claims by, or on behalf of, the government against
HCA relating to DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing and
home health issues. The civil issues that were not covered by
the Civil Agreement included claims related to physician
relations, cost reports and wound care issues. The Civil
Agreement was approved by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia in August 2001. HCA paid the government
$900 million (including accrued interest of
$60 million), as provided by the Civil Agreement and Plea
Agreement, during 2001. In January 2001, HCA entered into an
eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with
the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
Human Services.

The remaining aspects of the investigations were
resolved during 2003. In June 2003, HCA announced that the
Company and the Civil Division of the DOJ had signed agreements,
documenting the understanding announced in December 2002,
whereby the United States would dismiss the various claims it
had brought related to physician relations, cost reports and
wound care issues (the “DOJ Agreement”). The DOJ
Agreement received court approval in July 2003, and HCA paid the
DOJ $641 million (including accrued

interest of $10 million) during July 2003.
The DOJ Agreement does not affect

qui tam

cases in which
the government has not intervened. HCA also finalized an
agreement with a negotiating team representing states that may
have claims against the Company. Under this agreement, HCA paid
$17.7 million in July 2003 to state Medicaid agencies to
resolve these claims. HCA also paid $33 million for legal
fees of the private parties. In connection with the DOJ
Agreement, HCA recorded a pretax charge of $603 million
($418 million after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2002. The
consolidated income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2003 includes a pretax favorable change in
estimate of $41 million ($25 million after-tax)
related to Medicaid cost report balances for cost report years
ended December 31, 1997 and prior.

During June 2003, HCA announced that the Company
and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) had signed an agreement, documenting the
understanding announced in March 2002, to resolve all Medicare
cost report, home office cost statement and appeal issues
between HCA and CMS (the “CMS Agreement”) for cost
report periods ended before August 1, 2001. As a result of
the CMS Agreement, HCA paid CMS $250 million in June 2003.
HCA recorded a pretax charge of $260 million
($165 million after-tax), consisting of the accrual of
$250 million for the settlement payment and the write-off
of $10 million of net Medicare cost report receivables.
This charge was recorded in the consolidated income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2001.

During September 2003, HCA reached an
understanding with attorneys representing shareholder groups to
settle class action securities lawsuits originally filed in
1997. Under the terms of the settlement, a $49.5 million
settlement fund has been established to pay class members based
on their individual claims. HCA also reached an understanding
with its insurance carriers under which the insurers will pay
the majority of the settlement amount. Final approval of the
settlement was granted by the court on February 4, 2004.

HCA remains the subject of a December 1997 formal
order of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

If HCA was found to be in violation of Federal or
state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or
breach of the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such
sanctions or expenses could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s financial position, results of operation and
liquidity.

Business Strategy

HCA is committed to providing the communities it
serves high quality, cost-effective, health care while
maintaining consistency with HCA’s ethics and compliance
program, governmental regulations and guidelines, and industry
standards. As a part of this strategy, HCA’s management
focuses on the following areas:

•

Commitment to the care and improvement of
    human life:

The foundation of HCA is
    built on putting patients first and providing quality health
    care services in the communities it serves. HCA continues to
    increase efforts and funding for the Company’s patient
    safety agenda. Management believes patient outcomes will
    increasingly influence physician and patient choices concerning
    health care delivery.

•

Commitment to ethics and
    compliance:

HCA is committed to a
    corporate culture highlighted by the following
    values — compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness,
    loyalty, respect and kindness. The Company’s comprehensive
    ethics and compliance program articulates a set of values and
    behavioral standards to reinforce HCA’s dedication to these
    values and to ensure integrity.

•

Focus on core
    communities:

HCA strives to maintain
    market-leading positions in large, growing urban and suburban
    communities, primarily in the Southern and Western regions of
    the United States.



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Business Strategy (Continued)

•

Becoming the health care employer of
    choice:

HCA uses a number of industry
    leading practices to help ensure its hospitals are the health
    care employer of choice in their communities. The Company’s
    labor initiatives provide strategies to the hospitals for
    recruiting, compensation and productivity, and include various
    leadership and career development programs. The Company also
    maintains an internal contract labor agency to provide improved
    quality and reduce costs.

•

Continuing to strive for operational
    excellence:

The Company’s focus
    on operational excellence includes a group purchasing
    organization that achieves pricing efficiencies in purchasing
    and supply contracts. HCA also uses a shared services model to
    process revenue and accounts receivable through ten regional
    patient accounting services centers. In a natural progression of
    the Company’s ongoing strategy, HCA is increasing focus on
    operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and
    more convenient service for patients and increased
    predictability and efficiency for physicians. As part of this
    focus, HCA may buy or build outpatient facilities to improve its
    market presence.

•

Allocating capital to strategically complement
    its operational strategy and enhance stockholder
    value:

HCA’s capital spending is
    intended to increase bed capacity, provide new or expanded
    services in existing facilities, maintain or replace equipment
    and renovate existing facilities or construct replacement
    facilities. The Company also selectively evaluates acquisitions
    that may complement its strategies in existing or new markets.
    Capital may also be allocated to take advantage of opportunities
    such as repayment of indebtedness, stock repurchases and payment
    of dividends. In 2004, HCA’s Board of Directors approved an
    increase in its quarterly dividend from $0.02 per share to
    $0.13 per share.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of HCA’s consolidated
financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses. HCA’s management
base their estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that they believe are reasonable under the
circumstances. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing
basis and makes changes to the estimates and related disclosures
as experience develops or new information becomes known. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

Management believes that the following critical
accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial
statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the
health care services are provided, based upon the estimated
amounts due from payers. Estimates of contractual allowances
under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms
specified in the related contractual agreements. Laws and
regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are
complex and subject to interpretation. The estimated
reimbursement amounts are made on a payer-specific basis and are
recorded based on the best information available regarding
management’s interpretation of the applicable laws,
regulations and contract terms. Management continually reviews
the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate
updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in
managed care contractual terms that result from contract
renegotiations and renewals. Management has invested significant
resources to refine and improve the information system data used
to make these contractual estimates and to develop a
standardized calculation process and train employees.

HCA does not pursue collection of amounts related
to patients that meet the Company’s guidelines to qualify
as charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues.
The revenues associated with uninsured



HCA INC.

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
(Continued)

Revenues     (Continued)

patients that do not meet the Company’s
guidelines to qualify as charity care have generally been
reported in revenues at gross charges. During 2003, the Company
announced that patients treated at an HCA wholly-owned hospital
for nonelective care who have income at or below 200% of the
Federal poverty level are eligible for charity care, a standard
HCA estimates that 70% of its hospitals were previously using.
The Federal poverty level is established by the Federal
government and is based on income and family size. On
October 1, 2003, HCA began implementing a sliding scale of
discounts for uninsured patients, treated at HCA wholly-owned
hospitals for nonelective care, with income between 200% and
400% of the Federal poverty level.

Due to the complexities involved in these
estimations of revenues earned, the health care services
authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often
subject to interpretations that could result in payments that
are different from our estimates.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the
    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from
Medicare, managed care payers, other third-party payers and
patients is HCA’s primary source of cash and is critical to
the Company’s operating performance. The primary collection
risks relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient
accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the
amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient
responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain
outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due
directly from patients. Because HCA does not pursue collection
of amounts related to patients that meet the Company’s
guidelines to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
revenues and do not have an impact on the provision for doubtful
accounts. HCA expects the revised charity care and self-pay
discounting policy changes will result in reductions to both
revenues and the provision for doubtful accounts in future
periods.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts
is based upon management’s assessment of historical
write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic
conditions, trends in Federal and state governmental and private
employer health care coverage and other collection indicators.
Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of
historical write-offs and recoveries at facilities that
represent a majority of HCA’s revenues and accounts
receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary
source of information in estimating the collectability of
HCA’s accounts receivable. Prior to the third quarter of
2003, the Company performed the hindsight analysis on an annual
basis. The results of the annual hindsight analysis that was
completed during the second quarter of 2003 indicated an
increasing proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of
uninsured accounts and the collectability of this category of
accounts had deteriorated. Beginning with the third quarter of
2003, HCA began performing a quarterly, rolling twelve-month
hindsight analysis to enable a more timely reaction to trends
affecting the collectability of the accounts receivable. At
December 31, 2003, HCA’s allowance for doubtful
accounts, as a percentage of patient due accounts, was
approximately 88%. For the year ended December 31, 2003,
the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 10.1% of
revenues compared to 8.0% of revenues in 2002. Management does
not expect the provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
of revenues, to decline from 2003 levels during 2004, based upon
the revenue and trends at December 31, 2003. Adverse
changes in general economic conditions, business office
operations, payer mix, or trends in Federal or state
governmental and private employer health care coverage could
affect HCA’s collection of accounts receivable, cash flows
and results of operations.

Investments of Insurance
    Subsidiary – Other-than-temporary Impairment
    Considerations

HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
holds debt and equity security investments having an aggregate
fair value of $2.065 billion at December 31, 2003. The
fair value of the investment securities is generally based on
quoted market prices. The investment securities are held for the
purpose of providing the funding source to pay professional and
general liability claims covered by the insurance subsidiary.
Management’s assessment each quarter of whether a decline
in fair value is temporary or other-than-temporary involves
multiple judgment calls, often involves estimating the outcome
of future events, and requires a significant level of
professional judgment in determining whether factors exist that
indicate an impairment has occurred. HCA evaluates, among other
things, the financial position and near term prospects of the
issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of
the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected
future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of
the issuer by a rating agency to determine if, and when, a
decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost
is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and
extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
amortized cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the
investment to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
investment’s fair value are important components of
management’s investment securities evaluation process.
During 2002, HCA recognized a $168 million
other-than-temporary impairment charge related, primarily, to
the insurance subsidiary’s equity investment securities.
The equity investments market experienced generally, steady
increases during 2003 and at December 31, 2003, the
insurance subsidiary’s investment security portfolio had
unrealized gains of $212 million and unrealized losses of
$4 million.

Professional Liability Insurance
    Claims

HCA, along with virtually all health care
providers, operates in an environment with professional
liability risks. A substantial portion of HCA’s
professional liability risks is insured through a wholly-owned
insurance subsidiary. Reserves for professional liability risks
were $1.624 billion and $1.551 billion at
December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.
Obligations covered by reinsurance contracts remain on the
balance sheet as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
that reinsurers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for
professional liability risks (net of $147 million and
$265 million receivable under reinsurance contracts at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively) were
$1.477 billion and $1.286 billion at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Reserves and provisions for
professional liability risks are based upon actuarially
determined estimates. The independent actuaries estimated
reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance
contracts, were $1.255 billion to $1.515 billion at
December 31, 2003 and $1.022 billion to
$1.361 billion at December 31, 2002. Reserves for
professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate
cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the
respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves are
estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial
analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends
in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are continually
reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or
new information becomes known.

The reserves for professional liability risks
cover approximately 3,900 and 4,000 individual claims at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and estimates for
potential unreported claims. The time period required to resolve
these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated. The estimation of the
timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Changes
to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current
operating results. Due to the considerable variability that is
inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that the
ultimate liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Revenue/ Volume Trends

HCA’s revenues depend upon inpatient
occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs
ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of
outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment
rates for such services.

Admissions related to Medicare, managed care and
other discounted plans and Medicaid and self-pay for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are set forth below.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the 2003 presentation.

For 2003, consolidated admissions increased 3.3%
and same facility admissions increased by 0.6% compared to 2002.
Same facility outpatient surgeries declined 3.0% in 2003
compared to 2002. The weaker than expected volumes were the
result of general economic conditions and increasing
unemployment levels in certain markets. Additionally, in certain
markets, physician issues related to physicians retiring or
relocating due to rising physician malpractice insurance rates,
managed care contract disputes and new competition, both in the
inpatient and outpatient lines of business, are contributing to
a slower rate of volume growth. Another important factor
affecting outpatient surgeries was increased competition from
physician-owned specialty hospitals and physician-owned
freestanding surgery centers. To compete more effectively in the
outpatient area, the Company announced the appointment of a new
Group President for Outpatient Services effective
January 1, 2004. HCA also expects to increase, consistent
with applicable laws, its participation in the development of
physician partnerships for the delivery of certain outpatient
services in selected markets.

HCA’s health care facilities’ gross
charges typically do not reflect what the facilities are
actually paid. HCA’s health care facilities have entered
into agreements with third-party payers, including government
programs and managed care health plans, under which the
facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services,
predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or
discounts from gross charges. HCA’s facilities have
experienced revenue growth due to changes in patient mix and
favorable pricing trends. HCA has experienced increases in same
facility revenue per equivalent admission over the prior period
of 7.5%, 8.8% and 7.4%, for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. There can be no assurance
that HCA will continue to receive these levels of increases in
the future. These increases were the result of renegotiating and
renewing certain managed care contracts on more favorable terms,
shifts of managed care admissions to more favorable plans and
improved reimbursement from the government.

One factor contributing to the moderation in the
rate of increase in same facility revenue per equivalent
admission in 2003 compared to 2002 is the Company’s roll
out of the charity policies that were announced in March 2003.
Beginning in the second quarter of 2003, patients treated at an
HCA wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care who have income
at or below 200% of the Federal poverty level are eligible for
charity care, a standard HCA estimates that 70% of its hospitals
were previously using. In the fourth quarter of 2003, HCA
implemented a sliding scale of discounts for uninsured patients
treated at an HCA wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care
with income between 200% and 400% of the Federal poverty level.
Charity discounts, increased $242 million in 2003, compared
to 2002 (from $579 million to $821 million).

Revenue/ Volume
Trends (Continued)

The approximate percentages of inpatient revenues
of the Company’s facilities related to Medicare, managed
care plans and other discounted plans and Medicaid and self-pay
for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are
set forth below. Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the 2003 presentation.

HCA receives a significant portion of its
revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare
and Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent
and substantial changes. Future legislation or other changes or
interpretation of government health programs could have adverse
effects on reimbursement from the government.

Excluding the hospitals included in the Kansas
City acquisition, HCA recorded $218 million,
$284 million, and $240 million of revenues related to
Medicare operating outlier cases for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. These
amounts represent 3.7%, 5.1% and 4.7% of Medicare revenues and
1.0%, 1.4%, and 1.3% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. There can
be no assurances that HCA will continue to receive these levels
of Medicare outlier payments in future periods. Based on the
Company’s estimates, future Medicare operating outlier
payments will be materially, adversely affected by CMS’
published revisions to regulations on outlier payments. For
periods subsequent to October 1, 2003, assuming the Company
does not experience changes in Medicare patient acuity levels,
the Company estimates its monthly revenue from Medicare
operating outlier payments may be reduced by up to
$12 million. During the fourth quarter of 2003, Medicare
operating outlier payments were $22 million, compared to
$53 million in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Net income totaled $1.332 billion, or
$2.61 per diluted share, in 2003 compared to
$833 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in 2002. The
operating results for 2003 include a favorable change in
estimate related to Medicaid cost report balances for cost
report years ended 1997, and prior, of $41 million pretax,
or $0.05 per diluted share, gains on sales of facilities of
$85 million pretax, or $0.10 per diluted share,
impairment of long-lived assets of ($130) million pretax,
or ($0.16) per diluted share, and investigation related
costs of ($8) million pretax, or ($0.01) per diluted
share. The operating results for 2002 include a
($603) million pretax charge, or ($0.80) per diluted
share, related to the settlement with government agencies, gains
on the sales of facilities of $6 million pretax, or
$0.01 per diluted share, a ($168) million pretax
charge, or ($0.20) per diluted share, on the impairment of
investment securities, an impairment of long-lived assets of
($19) million pretax, or ($0.03) per diluted share,
and investigation related costs of ($58) million pretax, or
($0.07) per diluted share.

In April 2003, HCA completed the acquisition of
eleven hospitals in Kansas City. During 2003, the acquired
Kansas City hospitals produced revenues of $698 million and
a net loss of $22 million. The Kansas City hospitals are
included in the Company’s Western Group.

For 2003, admissions increased 3.3% and same
facility admissions increased by 0.6% compared to 2002.
Outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.5%, but decreased 3.0%
on a same facility basis. The weaker than expected volumes were
the result of general economic conditions and increasing
unemployment levels in certain markets. Additionally, in certain
markets, physician issues related to physicians retiring or
relocating due to rising physician malpractice insurance rates,
managed care contract disputes and new competition, both in the
inpatient and outpatient lines of business, are contributing to
a slower rate of volume growth.

Revenues for 2003 increased 10.5% compared to
2002. The 10.5% increase in revenues is primarily attributable
to the 7.6% increase in the same facility revenues and the
$698 million of revenues related to the acquired Kansas
City hospitals. The 7.6% increase in same facility revenues is
primarily attributable to rate increases, as same facility
equivalent admissions remained flat in 2003.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of
revenues, decreased to 39.8% in 2003 from 40.3% in 2002.
Excluding the acquired Kansas City hospitals, salaries and
benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 39.6% for 2003. The
decreases reflect improvements in the utilization of contract
labor. Contract labor per equivalent admission decreased 26.3%
for 2003 compared to 2002.

Supply costs increased, as a percentage of
revenues, to 16.2% for 2003 compared to 16.0% for 2002. Rising
supply costs, particularly in the cardiac, orthopedic and
pharmaceutical areas, continue to be a challenge for the Company.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of
contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance,
rents and leases, utilities, insurance and nonincome taxes), as
a percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.8% in 2003 from 16.9%
in 2002. Excluding the acquired Kansas City hospitals, other
operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues decreased to
16.5% for 2003.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
of revenues, increased to 10.1% in 2003 from 8.0% in 2002. The
factors influencing this increase include the Company’s
recent experience of increasing patient due or uninsured
accounts and a continued deterioration associated with the
collectability of these accounts. The soft economic environment
in many of the Company’s markets, combined with increasing
copayments and deductibles, are placing an increasing financial
responsibility on the patient. The provision for doubtful
accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from

patients. At December 31, 2003, the
Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage
of these patient due accounts was approximately 88%.

Equity in earnings of affiliates decreased from
$206 million in 2002 to $199 million in 2003. The
decrease was due to a decline in operating results at a hospital
joint venture in California.

Depreciation and amortization remained relatively
flat, as a percentage of revenues, at 5.1% in 2003 compared to
5.0% in 2002.

Interest expense increased to $491 million
in 2003 from $446 million in 2002. The increase in interest
expense was due to higher levels of debt in 2003 compared to
2002. Interest rates on the Company’s debt were lower in
2003 than in 2002. HCA’s ratio of current and long-term
debt to current and long-term debt and common and minority
equity was 55.8% at December 31, 2003 compared to 52.4% at
December 31, 2002.

The consolidated income statement for the year
ended December 31, 2003 includes a pretax favorable change
in estimate of $41 million ($25 million after-tax)
related to Medicaid cost report balances for cost report years
ended December 31, 1997, and prior.

During 2003, HCA recognized pretax gains on sales
of facilities of $85 million ($49 million after-tax),
primarily on the sale of two leased hospitals. Proceeds from the
sales were used to repay bank borrowings. During 2002, HCA
recognized pretax gains on sales of facilities of
$6 million ($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two
consolidating hospitals.

During 2002, due to the continued overall market
decline and management’s review and evaluation of the
individual investment securities, management concluded that
certain unrealized losses on HCA’s equity investments
should be classified as “other-than-temporary” and
recorded a pretax impairment charge on investment securities of
$168 million ($107 million after-tax).

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue
activities associated with the internal development of a patient
accounts receivable management system, resulting in a pretax
charge of $130 million ($79 million after-tax). During
2002, HCA management decided to delay the development and
implementation of certain financial and procurement information
systems, resulting in a pretax charge of $19 million.

During 2003 and 2002, respectively, HCA incurred
$8 million and $58 million of investigation related
costs. In 2003 and 2002, respectively, these costs included
$8 million and $56 million of professional fees (legal
and accounting) related to the governmental investigations. In
2002, $2 million of other costs were also included. The
governmental investigations of the Company’s business
practices were concluded during 2003, and the Company does not
currently expect to incur investigation related costs in 2004.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated
entities increased to $150 million for 2003 from
$148 million for 2002.

The effective income tax rate was 38.2% in 2003
and 42.7% in 2002. The higher effective income tax rate in 2002
was due to the recording of a valuation allowance in 2002.

Years Ended December 31, 2002 and

Net income totaled $833 million or
$1.59 per diluted share, in 2002 compared to
$955 million, or $1.78 per diluted share, in 2001. The
operating results for 2002 include a ($603) million pretax
charge, or ($0.80) per diluted share, related to the
settlement with government agencies, gains on the sales of
facilities of

$6 million pretax, or $0.01 per diluted
share, a ($168) million pretax charge, or ($0.20) per
diluted share, on the impairment of investment securities, an
impairment of long-lived assets of ($19) million pretax, or
($0.03) per diluted share, and investigation related costs
of ($58) million pretax, or ($0.07) per diluted share.
The operating results for 2001 include a ($262) million
pretax charge, or ($0.30) per diluted share, related to an
understanding with CMS to settle cost report, home office cost
statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS, pretax gains on
the sales of facilities of $131 million, or $0.14 per
diluted share, an impairment of long-lived assets of
($17) million pretax, or ($0.02) per diluted share,
investigation related costs of ($65) million pretax, or
($0.08) per diluted share, and a pretax loss on retirement
of debt of ($28) million, or ($0.03) per diluted share.

Revenues increased 9.9% from 2001 to 2002 due to
both volume and rate increases. Equivalent admissions increased
1.2% on a reported basis and 2.6% on a same facility basis.
Revenue per equivalent admission increased 8.6% on a reported
basis and 8.8% on a same facility basis. The revenue per
equivalent admission increases were the result of continued
efforts in renegotiating and renewing certain managed care
contracts on favorable terms, shifts from Medicare managed care
to traditional Medicare and shifts within managed care from HMO
to PPO products.

Salaries and benefits decreased, as a percentage
of revenues, to 40.3% in 2002 from 40.5% in 2001. Salaries and
benefits per equivalent admission increased 7.9% on a reported
basis and 8.3% on a same facility basis, while revenue per
equivalent admission increased 8.6% on a reported basis and 8.8%
on a same facility basis.

Supply costs increased slightly, as a percentage
of revenues, from 15.9% in 2001 to 16.0% in 2002. The 9.1%
increase in supplies per equivalent admission (including
cardiac, orthopedic and pharmaceutical supplies) exceeded the
8.6% increase in revenue per equivalent admission.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of
contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance,
rents and leases, utilities, insurance and non-income taxes), as
a percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.9% in 2002 from 18.1%
in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in
contract services costs that were incurred in 2001 related to
the preliminary project stage activities being performed to
develop the Company’s shared services initiatives.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage
of revenues, increased to 8.0% in 2002 from 7.7% in 2001.
Factors that influenced this increase included increases in
patient due or uninsured accounts, decreases in collectability
and the effect of rate increases. The revenues associated with
these patients are generally recorded at gross charges, which
are typically higher than what government programs and managed
care plans pay, and the majority of bad debts are attributed to
these uninsured and patient due accounts.

Gains and losses on sales of investments consist
primarily of realized gains and losses on the sales of
investment securities by HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary. In 2001, HCA had gains of $63 million compared
to losses of $2 million in 2002, due to continued overall
market declines during 2002.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
$158 million in 2001 to $206 million in 2002 due to
improved operations at the Company’s joint ventures.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a
percentage of revenues, to 5.0% in 2002 from 5.8% in 2001. HCA
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”) on January 1, 2002. Under the
provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer

amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
tests. During 2001, $76 million of goodwill amortization
was included in depreciation and amortization.

Interest expense decreased to $446 million
in 2002 from $536 million in 2001. Interest expense on
HCA’s variable rate bank debt decreased due to a decline in
short-term interest rates and an upgrade in HCA’s credit
rating.

During 2002, HCA recognized a pretax gain of
$6 million ($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two
consolidating hospitals. During 2001, HCA recognized a net
pretax gain of $131 million ($76 million after-tax) on
the sales of three consolidating hospitals, HCA’s interest
in two non-consolidating hospitals and a provider of specialty
managed care benefit programs.

During 2002, the continued overall market decline
and management’s quarterly review and evaluation of the
individual investment securities, provided the basis for a
conclusion that certain unrealized losses on HCA’s equity
investments should be classified as
“other-than-temporary” and an impairment charge on
investment securities of $168 million ($107 million
after-tax) was recorded. See Note 5 — Impairment
of Investment Securities in the notes to consolidated financial
statements.

During 2002, management decided to delay the
development and implementation of certain financial and
procurement information systems to concentrate and direct
efforts to the patient accounting and human resources
information systems, resulting in a pretax charge of
$19 million. During 2001, HCA reduced the carrying value
for a non-hospital, equity method joint venture to fair value,
based upon estimates of sales value, resulting in a pretax
charge of $17 million.

During 2002 and 2001, HCA incurred
$58 million and $65 million, respectively, of
investigation related costs. In 2002, these costs included
$56 million of professional fees (legal and accounting)
related to the governmental investigations and $2 million
of other costs. In 2001, these costs included $54 million
of professional fees (legal and accounting) related to the
governmental investigations and $11 million of other costs.

HCA adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13,
and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS 145”) on
January 1, 2002. Under the provisions of SFAS 145,
gains and losses on extinguishments of debt are generally
classified in operating income, rather than as extraordinary
items as previously required. During the fourth quarter of 2001,
HCA recognized an extraordinary charge on extinguishment of debt
of $28 million that has been reclassified in the
consolidated income statements.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated
entities remained flat as a percentage of revenues.

The effective income tax rate was 42.7% in 2002
and 40.0% in 2001. The higher effective income tax rate in 2002
was due to the recording of a valuation allowance and in 2001,
to certain nondeductible intangible assets related to gains on
sales of facilities and impairment of long-lived assets. If the
effect of the valuation allowance, the nondeductible intangible
assets and related amortization were excluded the effective
income tax rate would have been 39% for both periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$2.166 billion in 2003, compared to $2.750 billion in
2002 and $1.413 billion in 2001. Working capital totaled
$1.654 billion at December 31, 2003 and
$766 million at



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

AND RESULTS OF

Liquidity and Capital Resources
(Continued)

December 31, 2002. The decrease in cash flow
from operating activities from 2002 to 2003 and the increase in
working capital from December 31, 2002 to December 31,
2003 relate, primarily, to the Company making government
settlement payments of $942 million in 2003. The increase
in cash provided by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was
primarily due to the payment of $900 million to the Federal
government in 2001 pursuant to the Plea and Civil Agreements and
changes in income tax payments.

Cash used in investing activities was
$2.862 billion, $1.740 billion and $1.300 billion
in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Excluding acquisitions,
capital expenditures were $1.838 billion in 2003,
$1.718 billion in 2002 and $1.370 billion in 2001. HCA
expended $908 million, $124 million and
$239 million for acquisitions and investments in and
advances to affiliates during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
During April 2003, HCA completed the acquisition of the Health
Midwest system in Kansas City. The aggregate cash paid by HCA at
closing was $855 million. During 2002 and 2001 the cash
paid was generally for interests in joint ventures that are
accounted for using the equity method. Capital expenditures in
all three years were funded by a combination of cash flows from
operations and the issuance of debt. Annual planned capital
expenditures are expected to approximate $1.8 billion in
2004 and approximate $1.6 billion for 2005. At
December 31, 2003, there were projects under construction,
which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip
over the next five years of $2.0 billion. HCA expects to
finance capital expenditures with internally generated and
borrowed funds.

In addition to cash flows from operations,
available sources of capital include amounts available under
HCA’s $1.75 billion revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) ($1.177 billion and $926
million as of December 31, 2003 and February 29, 2004,
respectively) and anticipated access to public and private debt
markets. Management believes that the Company’s available
sources of capital are adequate to expand, improve and equip its
existing health care facilities and to complete selective
acquisitions.

Investments of HCA’s professional liability
insurance subsidiary, to maintain statutory equity and pay
claims, totaled $2.065 billion and $1.655 billion at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Claims payments,
net of reinsurance recoveries, during the next twelve months are
expected to approximate $275 million. HCA’s
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain
reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the
reinsurance contracts remain on the balance sheet as the
subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do
not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. To
minimize its exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies, HCA
evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors
concentrations of credit risk arising from similar activities or
economic characteristics of the reinsurers. The amounts
receivable related to the reinsurance contracts of
$147 million and $265 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, are included in other assets.

Cash flows provided by financing activities
totaled $650 million in 2003, compared to cash used in
financing activities of $934 million in 2002 and
$342 million in 2001. During 2003, HCA accessed the Credit
Facility and the public debt market to raise capital. The
increase in cash used during 2002 compared to 2001 was related
to the repayment of an investment made by a financial
institution that invested $400 million to capitalize an
entity that acquired HCA common stock. The primary source of
funds for the cash used in financing activities was cash flow
from operating activities.

During the second quarter of 2003, HCA paid CMS
$250 million to resolve all Medicare cost report, home
office cost statement, and appeal issues between HCA and CMS for
the cost report periods ended before August 1, 2001. During
the third quarter of 2003, HCA paid the DOJ $641 million
(including $10 million in accrued interest) to resolve all
remaining investigation issues between the Company and the DOJ.
HCA also paid $17.7 million to state Medicaid agencies and
$33 million for private party legal fees. Upon the Company

making the payments to the DOJ, the Company no
longer has any remaining obligation to maintain letters of
credit with the DOJ.

In January 2004, HCA’s Board of Directors
approved an increase in its quarterly dividend from
$0.02 per share to $0.13 per share. The Board declared
the initial $0.13 per share dividend payable on
June 1, 2004 to shareholders of record at May 1, 2004.

Financing Activities

In April 2001, HCA entered into a
$2.5 billion credit agreement (the “2001 Credit
Agreement”) with a group of banks consisting of the
$1.75 billion revolving Credit Facility and a
$750 million term loan (the “2001 Term Loan”).
The 2001 Credit Agreement has a final maturity in April 2006.
Interest under the 2001 Credit Agreement is payable at a spread
to LIBOR, a spread to the prime lending rate or a competitive
bid rate. The spread is dependent on HCA’s credit ratings.
The 2001 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants which
include (i) limitations on debt levels,
(ii) limitations on sales of assets, mergers and changes of
ownership, and (iii) maintenance of minimum interest
coverage ratios. As of January 31, 2004, HCA was in
compliance with all such covenants.

In April 2002, HCA issued $500 million of
6.95% notes due May 1, 2012. Proceeds from the notes
were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility
and for general corporate purposes.

In September 2002, HCA issued $500 million
of 6.30% notes due October 1, 2012. Proceeds from the
notes were used to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit
Facility and for general corporate purposes.

In February 2003, HCA issued $500 million of
6.25% notes due February 15, 2013. In July 2003, HCA
issued $500 million of 6.75% notes due July 15,
2013. Following the issuance of the July 2003 notes, the Company
had issued debt securities equal to the amount registered in the
$1.5 billion shelf registration statement filed in May 2002.

During July 2003, HCA filed a shelf registration
statement and prospectus with the SEC that allows the Company to
issue up to $2.5 billion in debt securities.

During November 2003, HCA issued
$350 million of 5.25% notes due November 6, 2008
and issued $250 million of 7.5% notes due
November 6, 2033. Proceeds from the notes were used to
repay a portion of the outstanding amount under the Credit
Facility.

Share Repurchase Activities

In April 2003, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase $1.5 billion of its common stock. HCA expects to
repurchase its shares through open market purchases or privately
negotiated transactions. During 2003, through open market
purchases, HCA repurchased under this authorization
25.3 million shares of its common stock for
$900 million.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock.
During 2002, HCA made open market purchases of 6.2 million
shares for $282 million. During 2003, HCA purchased
5.8 million shares for $214 million, which completed
the repurchases under this authorization. The repurchases were
intended to offset the dilutive effect of employee stock benefit
plans.

In October 2001, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock.
During 2001, HCA repurchased 6.4 million shares through
open market purchases for $250 million, completing the
repurchase authorization.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
(Continued)

Share Repurchase
Activities (Continued)

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a
financial institution that resulted in the financial institution
investing $400 million (at December 31, 2001) to
capitalize an entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This
consolidated affiliate acquired 16.8 million shares of HCA
common stock in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain
forward purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the
financial institution and received the 16.8 million shares
of the Company’s common stock.

In March 2000, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to $1 billion of the Company’s common
stock. During 2001, HCA settled forward purchase contracts
representing 19.6 million shares at a cost of
$677 million, purchased 1.1 million shares through
open market purchases at a cost of $40 million, and
received $17 million in premiums from the sale of put
options, completing the repurchase authorization.

In November 1999, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. During
2001, HCA settled forward purchase contracts associated with its
November 1999 authorization representing 15.7 million
shares at a cost of $461 million, completing the repurchase
authorization.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the share repurchase
transactions reduced stockholders’ equity by
$1.114 billion, $282 million and $738 million,
respectively.

Systems Development Projects

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue
activities associated with the development of a patient
accounting software system, resulting in a pretax charge of
$130 million. HCA had estimated that the patient accounting
project would have required total expenditures of approximately
$400 million to develop and install. The Company is now
redirecting efforts in this area to the implementation of
enhancements to its existing patient accounting system. HCA is
also in the process of implementing projects to replace its
payroll and human resources information systems. Management
estimates that the payroll and human resources system projects
will require total expenditures of approximately
$332 million to develop and install. At December 31,
2003, project-to-date costs incurred were $212 million
($137 million of the costs incurred have been capitalized
and $75 million have been expensed). Management expects
that the system development, testing, data conversion and
installation activities will continue through 2006. There can be
no assurance that the development and implementation of these
systems will not be delayed, that the total cost will not be
significantly more than currently anticipated, that business
processes will not be interrupted during implementation or that
HCA will realize the expected benefits and efficiencies from the
developed products.

Management believes that cash flows from
operations, amounts available under the Credit Facility and
HCA’s anticipated access to public and private debt markets
are sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next
twelve months.

Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

As of December 31, 2003, maturities of
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are
presented in the table below (dollars in millions):

Market Risk

HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes
in market values of securities. The investments in debt and
equity securities of HCA’s wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary were $1.367 billion and $698 million,
respectively, at December 31, 2003. These investments are
carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and
losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive
income. The fair value of investments is generally based on
quoted market prices. During the third quarter of 2002,
management completed its quarterly review and evaluation of the
individual investment securities and concluded that certain
unrealized losses of HCA’s insurance subsidiary’s
equity investments were considered
“other-than-temporary.” HCA recorded an impairment
charge on the identified investment securities of
$168 million. The declines in fair value and the resulting
losses incurred on sales of the securities on which the
impairment charge was recorded did not present a liquidity
concern to the Company. However, if the insurance subsidiary
were to experience significant declines in the fair value of its
investments, this could require additional investment by the
Company to allow the insurance subsidiary to satisfy its minimum
capital requirements.

HCA evaluates, among other things, the financial
position and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in
the issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes
in the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
“other-than-temporary.” The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment
to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s
fair value are important components of management’s
investment securities evaluation process. At Decem-



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Market Risk (Continued)

ber 31, 2003, HCA had a net unrealized gain
of $208 million on the insurance subsidiary’s
investment securities.

HCA is also exposed to market risk related to
changes in interest rates, and HCA periodically enters into
interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to these
fluctuations. HCA’s interest rate swap agreements involve
the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments
between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts
and maturity dates. The notional amounts and interest payments
in these agreements match the cash flows of the related
liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis. These derivatives and the related hedged
debt amounts have been recognized in the financial statements at
their respective fair values.

With respect to HCA’s interest-bearing
liabilities, approximately $2.1 billion of long-term debt
at December 31, 2003 is subject to variable rates of
interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of
$6.6 billion at December 31, 2003 is subject to fixed
rates of interest. Both the general level of U.S. interest
rates and, for the 2001 Credit Agreement, the Company’s
credit rating affect HCA’s variable interest rates.
HCA’s variable rate debt is comprised of the Company’s
Credit Facility, on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR
plus 0.7% to 1.5% (depending on HCA’s credit ratings); a
bank term loan, on which interest is payable generally at LIBOR
plus 1% to 2%, and fixed rate notes on which interest rate swaps
have been employed, on which interest is payable at LIBOR plus
1.6% to 2.4%. Due to decreases in LIBOR the average rate for the
Company’s Credit Facility decreased from 2.5% for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to 1.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2003, and the average rate for the
Company’s term loans decreased from 2.8% for the year ended
December 31, 2002 to 2.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The estimated fair value of HCA’s
total long-term debt was $9.3 billion at December 31,
2003. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt
with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in
interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future
pretax earnings would be approximately $21 million. The
impact of such a change in interest rates on the fair value of
long-term debt would not be significant. The estimated changes
to interest expense and the fair value of long-term debt are
determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates
on HCA’s borrowing cost and long-term debt balances. To
mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, HCA
generally targets a portion of its debt portfolio to be
maintained at fixed rates.

Foreign operations and the related market risks
associated with foreign currency are currently insignificant to
HCA’s results of operations and financial position.

Effects of Inflation and Changing
Prices

Various Federal, state and local laws have been
enacted that, in certain cases, limit HCA’s ability to
increase prices. Revenues for acute care hospital services
rendered to Medicare patients are established under the Federal
government’s prospective payment system. Total Medicare
revenues approximated, 28% in 2003, 2002 and in 2001 of
HCA’s total patient revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry
operating margins have been, and may continue to be, under
significant pressure because of changes in payer mix and growth
in operating expenses in excess of the increase in prospective
payments under the Medicare program. In addition, as a result of
increasing regulatory and

AND RESULTS OF

competitive pressures, HCA’s ability to
maintain operating margins through price increases to
non-Medicare patients is limited.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals
Division of the IRS, the United States Tax Court (the “Tax
Court”), the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the
United State Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (the
“Sixth Circuit”) certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2000 Federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 Federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1987 through 1988 and 1991 through 1993 Federal income tax
returns and Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital
Company’s (“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994
Federal income tax returns.

During 2001, HCA filed an appeal with the Sixth
Circuit with respect to two Tax Court decisions received in 1996
related to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of
America’s 1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns,
contesting Tax Court decisions related to the method that
Hospital Corporation of America used to calculate its tax
reserve for doubtful accounts and the timing of deferred income
recognition in connection with its sales of certain subsidiaries
to Healthtrust. During the third quarter of 2003, a three-judge
panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed these Tax Court decisions.
During February 2004, the Sixth Circuit denied HCA’s
petition for rehearing. HCA is reviewing the Sixth
Circuit’s decision and considering whether to undertake
further appeals. Because of the volume and complexity of
calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, the IRS has
not determined the amount of additional tax and interest that it
may claim for subsequent taxable periods.

Other disputed items include the timing of
recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000, the
amount of insurance expense deducted in 1999 and 2000, and the
amount of gain or loss recognized on the divestiture of certain
non-core business units in 1998. The IRS is claiming an
additional $381 million in income taxes and interest with
respect to these issues through December 31, 2003.

During 2001, the Company and the IRS filed
Stipulated Settlements with the Tax Court regarding the
IRS’ proposed disallowance of certain financing costs,
systems conversion costs and insurance premiums, which were
deducted in calculating taxable income, and the allocation of
costs among fixed assets and goodwill in connection with certain
hospitals acquired by the Company in 1995 and 1996. The
settlement resulted in the Company’s payment of additional
tax and interest of $16 million and had no impact on the
Company’s results of operations.

During the first quarter of 2004, the IRS began
an examination of HCA’s 2001 through 2002 Federal income
tax returns. HCA is presently unable to estimate the amount of
any additional income tax and interest that the IRS may claim
upon completion of this examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have
been recorded to satisfy final resolution of the disputed
issues. Management believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation
of America and Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and
paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements
established with the IRS during previous examinations and that
final resolution of these disputes will not have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
position.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, and the related consolidated statements of income,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” effective January 1, 2002.

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

Reporting
Entity

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates
own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The
term “affiliates” includes direct and indirect
subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in
which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2003,
these affiliates owned and operated 184 hospitals, 79
freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient
and ancillary services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in
joint ventures that own and operate seven hospitals and four
freestanding surgery centers, which are accounted for using the
equity method. The Company’s facilities are located in
23 states, England and Switzerland. The terms
“HCA” or the “Company”, as used in this
annual report on Form 10-K, refer to HCA Inc. and its
affiliates unless otherwise stated or indicated by context.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The majority of the Company’s
expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could
be classified as general and administrative by HCA would include
the HCA corporate office costs, which were $156 million,
$143 million and $144 million for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The consolidated financial statements include all
subsidiaries and entities controlled by HCA. “Control”
is generally defined by HCA as ownership of a majority of the
voting interest of an entity. The consolidated financial
statements include entities in which HCA absorbs a majority of
the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been
eliminated. Investments in entities that HCA does not control,
but in which it has a substantial ownership interest and can
exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the
equity method.

HCA has completed various acquisitions and joint
venture transactions. The accounts of these entities have been
consolidated with those of HCA for periods subsequent to the
acquisition of controlling interests.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service
revenues that are recorded based upon established billing rates
less allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are
recorded during the period the health care services are
provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients
and third-party payers, including Federal and state agencies
(under the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs), managed
care health plans, commercial insurance companies and employers.
Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Managed care agreements’
contractual payment terms are generally based upon predetermined
rates per diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted
fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and
Medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As
a result, there is at least a reasonable possibility that
recorded estimates will change by a material amount. The
estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent
periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final
settlements are determined (in relation to certain government
programs, primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as
the “cost report” filing and settlement process). The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts resulted in
increases to revenues of $96 million, $76 million and
$105 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Revenues
(Continued)

HCA provides care to patients who are financially
unable to pay for the health care services they receive, and
because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts determined to
qualify as charity care, they are not reported in revenues.
During 2003, the Company announced that patients treated at an
HCA wholly-owned hospital for nonelective care who have income
at or below 200% of the Federal poverty level are eligible for
charity care, a standard HCA estimates that 70% of its hospitals
were previously using. The Federal poverty level is established
by the Federal government and is based on income and family
size. On October 1, 2003, HCA began implementing a sliding
scale of discounts for uninsured patients, treated at HCA
wholly-owned hospitals for nonelective care, with income between
200% and 400% of the Federal poverty level.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid
investments with a maturity of three months or less when
purchased. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
instruments.

Accounts
Receivable

HCA receives payments for services rendered from
Federal and state agencies (under the Medicare, Medicaid and
TRICARE programs), managed care health plans, commercial
insurance companies, employers and patients. During the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, approximately 28%
of HCA’s revenues related to patients participating in the
Medicare program. HCA recognizes that revenues and receivables
from government agencies are significant to its operations, but
does not believe that there are significant credit risks
associated with these government agencies. HCA does not believe
that there are any other significant concentrations of revenues
from any particular payer that would subject it to any
significant credit risks in the collection of its accounts
receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts
are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts.
Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the
allowance and subsequent recoveries are added.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts
is based upon management’s assessment of historical and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in Federal and state governmental and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. The
provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful
accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients.
Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of
historical write-offs and recoveries at facilities that
represent a majority of HCA’s revenues and accounts
receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a primary
source of information to utilize in estimating the
collectability of HCA’s accounts receivable. The Company
had previously performed the hindsight analysis on an annual
basis. The results of the hindsight analysis that was completed
during the second quarter of 2003 indicated an increasing
proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
accounts and the collectability of this category of accounts had
deteriorated. During the third quarter of 2003, the Company
began performing a quarterly, rolling twelve-month hindsight
analysis to enable it to react more quickly to trends affecting
the collectability of the accounts receivable. At
December 31, 2003, HCA’s allowance for doubtful
accounts, represented approximately 88% of the
$3.000 billion total patient due accounts receivable
balance. Adverse changes in general economic conditions,
business office operations, payer mix, or trends in Federal or
state governmental health care coverage could affect HCA’s
collection of accounts receivable, cash flows and results of
operations.

Property and Equipment and Amortizable
    Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the
straight-line method, was $1.108 billion in 2003,
$1.007 billion in 2002, and $961 million in 2001.
Buildings and improvements are depreciated over estimated useful
lives ranging generally from ten to 40 years. Estimated
useful lives of equipment vary generally from four to ten years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the
lives of the respective debt obligations. The gross carrying
amount of deferred loan costs at December 31, 2003 and 2002
was $107 million and $91 million, respectively, and
accumulated amortization was $32 million and
$24 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is included in
interest expense and was $10 million, $11 million and
$12 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

On January 1, 2002, HCA adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“SFAS 144”). Prior to January 1, 2002, HCA
recognized impairments of long-lived assets in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121
“Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of.” In accordance with
SFAS 144, when events, circumstances or operating results
indicate that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets
and related identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill)
that are expected to be held and used, might be impaired, HCA
prepares projections of the undiscounted future cash flows
expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual
disposition. If the projections indicate that the recorded
amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are
reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated
based upon internal evaluations of each market that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities and independent appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported
at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less costs
to sell or close. The estimates of fair value are usually based
upon recent sales of similar assets and market responses based
upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Goodwill

HCA adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS 142”) on January 1,
2002. Under SFAS 142, beginning in 2002, goodwill is no
longer amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. The
Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit assets to
the carrying amount on at least an annual basis to determine if
there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the
reporting unit assets is less than its carrying value, the
Company compares the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying
value. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value of
goodwill is estimated based upon internal evaluations of the
related long-lived assets in each market that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities and market responses based
upon discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.
The market responses are usually considered to provide the most
reliable estimates of fair value. During 2003, goodwill
increased by $491 million related to acquisitions,
decreased by $13 million related to facilities that were
sold and increased by $9 million related to foreign
currency translation adjustments. During 2002, goodwill
increased by $32 million related to acquisitions, decreased
by $30 million related to facilities that were sold and
increased by $8 million due to foreign currency translation
adjustments. No goodwill impairment losses were recognized
during 2003 or 2002.

practice, clinic and other acquisitions.

Professional Liability Insurance
    Claims

A substantial portion of HCA’s professional
liability risks is insured through a wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary of HCA, which is funded annually. Reserves for
professional liability risks were $1.624 billion and
$1.551 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The current portion of this reserve,
$310 million and $358 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively, is included in “Other accrued
expenses” in the consolidated balance sheet. Provisions for
losses related to professional liability risks were
$380 million, $315 million and $252 million for
the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively, is classified in “Other operating
expenses” in the Company’s consolidated income
statement. Provisions for losses related to professional
liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates.
Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate
net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through
the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves
for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using
individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those
estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity
and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and
adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new
information becomes known. The changes to the estimated reserve
amounts are included in current operating results. The reserves
for professional liability risks cover approximately 3,900 and
4,000 individual claims at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, and estimates for potential unreported claims. The
time period required to resolve these claims can vary depending
upon the jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or
litigated. During 2003 and 2002, $264 million and
$258 million, respectively, of payments (net of reinsurance
recoveries of $32 million and $68 million,
respectively) were made for professional and general liability
claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year
can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is
inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, management
believes that the reserves for losses and loss expenses are
adequate; however, there can be no assurance that the ultimate
liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

HCA’s facilities are insured by the
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
$25 million per occurrence. Professional liability risks
above a $10 million retention per occurrence for 2002 were
reinsured with unrelated commercial carriers. The insurance
subsidiary obtained no reinsurance for 2003 and 2004. HCA also
maintains professional liability insurance with unrelated
commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
its insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts
remain on the balance sheet, as the subsidiary remains liable to
the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations
under the reinsurance contracts. The amounts receivable under
the reinsurance contracts of $147 million and
$265 million at December 31, 2003, and 2002,
respectively, are included in other assets. In addition,
deferred gains from retroactive reinsurance of $11 million
were included in other liabilities at December 31, 2002.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
investments of HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
classified as “available-for-sale” as defined in
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities” and are recorded in HCA’s consolidated
balance sheet at fair value. The investment securities are held
for the purpose of providing the funding source

to pay professional and general liability claims
covered by the insurance subsidiary. Management’s
assessment of individual investment securities each quarter, as
to whether declines in market value are temporary or
other-than-temporary involves multiple judgment calls, often
involves estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a
significant level of professional judgment in determining
whether factors exist that indicate an impairment has occurred.
HCA evaluates, among other things, the financial position and
near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the
issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in
the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency, to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
other-than-temporary. The length of time and extent to which the
fair value of the investment is less than amortized cost and
HCA’s ability and intent to retain the investment, to allow
for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair
value, are important components of management’s investment
securities evaluation process.

Minority Interests in Consolidated
    Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100%
owned entities that are controlled by HCA. Accordingly,
management has recorded minority interests in the earnings and
equity of such entities.

Related Party Transactions

MedCap Properties, LLC,
    (“MedCap”)

In December 2000, HCA transferred
116 medical office buildings (“MOBs”) to MedCap.
HCA received approximately $250 million and a minority
interest (approximately 48%) in MedCap in the transaction.
MedCap is a private company that was formed by HCA and other
investors to acquire the buildings. HCA did not recognize a gain
or loss on the transaction. A relative of a Director and former
executive officer of the Company served as the Chief Manager of
MedCap.

In October 2003, MedCap sold its
113 MOB’s to Health Care Property Investors, Inc.
(“HCP”). The sale of MedCap to HCP included HCA’s
ownership interest in MedCap, and HCA has no ownership interest
in HCP. The distribution of the MedCap sale proceeds resulted in
HCA recording a deferred gain of $80 million. The
transaction is being accounted for as a financing transaction
and the potential gain amount is being deferred due to
HCA’s continuing involvement with the MOBs related to
certain contingent, protective put and call rights. If the
prohibited continuing involvement provisions were remedied, the
deferred gain amount would not be recognized currently, but
would be amortized over the applicable lease terms for the MOBs
in which HCA leases space from HCP. The former Chief Manager of
MedCap, continues to manage the MOB’s as an employee of HCP.

HCA leased certain office space from MedCap and,
during the years ended December 31, 2003 (through September
2003), 2002 and 2001, paid MedCap $16.1 million,
$19.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, in
rents for such leased office space. HCA continues to lease
certain office space from HCP. HCA believes its transactions
with MedCap were on terms no less favorable to HCA than those
which would have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.

In May 1999, HCA completed the spin-offs of
LifePoint and Triad (the “Spin-offs”) through the
distribution of shares of LifePoint common stock and Triad
common stock to HCA stockholders. In connection with the
Spin-offs, HCA entered into agreements to provide financial,
clinical, patient accounting and network information services to
LifePoint and Triad. The agreements have terms expiring in May
2006. In addition, HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
provides insurance and risk management services, negotiated on a
year-to-year basis, to LifePoint and Triad. For the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, HCA received
$11.9 million, $11.8 million and $11.6 million,
respectively, from LifePoint and $43.8 million,
$46.5 million and $35.6 million, respectively, from
Triad pursuant to these agreements. The fees provided for in the
agreements are intended to be market competitive and are based
on HCA’s costs incurred in providing the services. During
2001, HCA sold a hospital facility to LifePoint for a sales
price of $19 million and realized a pretax gain of
$3 million. HCA believes the sale of the hospital facility
to LifePoint was on terms no less favorable to HCA than those
which would have been obtained from an unaffiliated party.

Global Health Exchange, LLC
    (“GHX”)

In 1999, HCA formed empactHealth.com, with the
intent of improving its hospitals’ efficiencies in the
procurement of goods and supplies by utilizing the Internet. In
January 2001, empactHealth.com merged with Medibuy, an unrelated
competitor of empactHealth.com. As a result of the merger, HCA
owned approximately 17% of Medibuy and HCA’s directors and
certain members of its management owned approximately 2%. During
2001, HCA reduced the carrying value for its investment in
Medibuy to fair value, based upon estimates of sales values,
resulting in a pretax charge of $17 million
($10 million after-tax). During 2002, HCA paid
$2.4 million to Medibuy for annual software license fees,
transaction fees and related services and paid and expensed
$3 million of additional investment payments to Medibuy.
During 2002, HCA’s management and directors relinquished
their ownership in Medibuy for no consideration. In December
2002, Medibuy merged with GHX. As a result of the merger, HCA
owns approximately 7% of GHX and an officer of HCA serves on
GHX’s board of directors. HCA and GHX entered into a
three-year, master user agreement, which commenced on
January 1, 2003, pursuant to which GHX provides access to
its e-commerce system, a license to certain requisitioning
software and other services. During 2003, HCA paid GHX
$3 million for software and other related services. The
user agreement with GHX provides for annual payments of
$2.5 million for 2004 and 2005. Healthtrust Purchasing
Group (“HPG”), an affiliate of HCA, also entered into
an e-commerce agreement with GHX, which commenced on
January 1, 2003, pursuant to which HPG will be able to
offer the GHX e-commerce system to HPG members. HCA believes its
transactions with Medibuy and GHX are on terms no less favorable
to HCA than those which would be obtained from unaffiliated
parties.

HealthStream, Inc.

provides for minimum fees of $2.5 million per year, with
total minimum fees of $12 million over the four-year term.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company paid HealthStream
$2.6 million, $2.9 million, and $1.5 million
which represented approximately 15%, 18% and 11%, respectively,
of HealthStream’s net revenues. The Chief Executive
Officer, President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of
HealthStream is a relative of a Director and former executive
officer of HCA. HCA believes its transactions with HealthStream
are on terms no less favorable to HCA than those which would be

Stock-Based Compensation

HCA applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for
its employee stock benefit plans. Accordingly, no compensation
cost has been recognized for HCA’s stock options granted
under the plans because the exercise prices for options granted
were equal to the quoted market prices on the option grant dates
and all option grants were to employees or directors.

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), HCA has
determined pro forma net income and earnings per share, as if
compensation cost for HCA’s employee stock option and stock
purchase plans had been determined based upon fair values at the
grant dates. These pro forma amounts are as follows (dollars in
millions, except per share amounts):

(a)

HCA determines pro forma stock-based employee
    compensation expense using an estimated forfeiture assumption. A
    forfeiture assumption of 50% had been used for periods through
    December 31, 2001. This 50% forfeiture assumption was
    reasonable for stock option grants made during the 1995 through
    1998 period, but subsequent to the Company completing a major
    restructuring process that involved significant executive
    management turnover, the Spin-offs, and the sales of numerous
    facilities, HCA determined during 2002 that the forfeiture
    assumption for 1999 and subsequent grants should be lowered
    significantly. During 2002, HCA revised the expected forfeiture
    assumption for the 1999 and 2000 stock option grants to 15%, and
    a 10% forfeiture assumption is being used for 2001 and
    subsequent stock option grants. The effect of the changes in the
    estimated forfeiture assumptions for stock option grants made
    prior to 2002, was an increase to the pro forma stock-based
    employee compensation expense for the year ended
    December 31, 2002 of $64 million after-tax
    ($0.13 per basic share and $0.12 diluted share).

For SFAS 123 purposes, the weighted average
fair values of HCA’s stock options granted in 2003, 2002
and 2001 were $13.49, $13.30 and $15.93 per share,
respectively. The fair values were estimated using the
Black-Scholes option valuation model with the following weighted
average assumptions:

Stock-Based
Compensation (Continued)

The expected volatility is derived using weekly,
historical market price data for periods preceding the date of
grant. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on
four-year United States Treasury Strips on the date of grant.
The expected life is an estimate of the number of years an
option will be held before it is exercised. The valuation model
was not adjusted for nontransferability, risk of forfeiture or
the vesting restrictions of the options, all of which would
reduce the value if factored into the calculation.

The pro forma compensation cost related to the
shares of common stock issued under HCA’s amended and
restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $16 million,
$13 million and $6 million for the years 2003, 2002
and 2001, respectively. These pro forma costs were determined
based on the estimated fair values at the beginning of each
subscription period.

Derivatives

Effective January 1, 2001, HCA adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities”, as amended (“SFAS 133”).
SFAS 133 requires that all derivatives, whether designated
in hedging relationships or not, be recognized on the
consolidated balance sheet at fair value. If the derivative is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value
of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in
earnings. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in
other comprehensive income and are recognized in the income
statement when the hedged item affects earnings. In accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 133, HCA has designated its
outstanding interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges.
HCA has determined that the current agreements are highly
effective in offsetting the fair value changes in a portion of
HCA’s debt portfolio. These derivatives and the related
hedged debt amounts have been recognized in the consolidated
financial statements at their respective fair values.

Recent Pronouncements

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 143, “Accounting for
Obligations Associated with the Retirement of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 143”). SFAS 143
establishes accounting standards for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated
asset retirement cost. It also provides accounting guidance for
legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
long-lived assets. HCA adopted SFAS 143 effective
January 1, 2003, and the provisions of SFAS 143 have
not had a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations or financial position.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 62, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections”
(“SFAS 145”). For most companies, under the
provisions of SFAS 145 gains and losses on extinguishments
of debt will generally be classified as income or loss from
continuing operations, rather than as extraordinary items, as
previously required under FASB Statement No. 4.
Extraordinary item treatment will be required for certain
extinguishments that comply with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 30. Upon
adoption, any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt previously
classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods, that did
not meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30 for such
classification, must be reclassified to conform to the
provisions of SFAS 145. HCA elected to adopt SFAS 145
effective January 1, 2002. During 2001, HCA recognized an
extraordinary charge on extinguishment of debt of
$28 million ($17 million, after-tax) that has been
reclassified in the consolidated income statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, “Accounting
for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires that a
liability for a

cost associated with an exit or disposal activity
be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under previous
accounting standards, a liability for an exit cost was
recognized at the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit
plan. The provisions of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or
disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. This
statement has not had a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations or financial position.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation
No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51” (“FIN 46”). FIN 46
requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise
absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses,
receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual
returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other
financial interests in the entity. FIN 46 also requires
disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is
not required to consolidate, but in which it has a significant
variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after
January 31, 2003 and to existing entities in the first
fiscal year or interim period ending after December 15,
2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all
financial statements issued after January 31, 2003,
regardless of when the variable interest entity was established.
This statement has not had a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position.

In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 149, “Amendment of
Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“SFAS 149”). SFAS 149 is
intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as
either freestanding derivative instruments subject to Statement
No. 133 in its entirety, or as hybrid instruments with debt
host contracts and embedded derivative features. In the case of
derivatives that contain a financing element, SFAS 149
requires the derivative counterparty who is considered the
“borrower” in the derivative to report all of the
derivative’s cash inflows and outflows as “financing
activities” in the statement of cash flows. SFAS 149
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003, and hedging relationships designated after
June 30, 2003. This statement has not had a material impact
on the Company’s results of operation or financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both
Liabilities and Equity” (“SFAS 150”). This
statement generally requires liability classification for two
broad classes of financial instruments. Under SFAS 150,
instruments that represent, or are indexed to, an obligation to
buy back the issuer’s shares, regardless whether the
instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross physical basis are
required to be classified as liabilities. Obligations that can
be settled in shares, but either derive their value
predominately from some other underlying, have a fixed value, or
have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite
direction as the issuer’s shares, are also required to be
classified as liabilities under this statement. SFAS 150
must be applied immediately to instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003 and to all other instruments
that exist as of the beginning of the first interim financial
reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. In October
2003, the FASB voted to defer for an indefinite period, the
application of the SFAS 150 guidance to noncontrolling
interests in limited-life subsidiaries. The FASB decided to
defer this application of SFAS 150 to allow them the
opportunity to consider possible implementation issues that
would result from the proposed SFAS 150 guidance regarding
measurement and recognition of noncontrolling interests. HCA
will assess the impact of the FASB’s reconsiderations, if
any, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
when they are finalized.

NOTE 2 — INVESTIGATIONS AND
SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN GOVERNMENT CLAIMS

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the
subject of governmental investigations and litigation relating
to its business practices. The governmental investigations
included activities for certain entities for periods prior to
their acquisition by the Company and activities for certain
entities that have been divested. As part of the investigations,
the United States intervened in a number of

actions brought by private parties.

The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In December
2000, HCA entered into a Plea Agreement with the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and
various U.S. Attorneys’ offices (the “Plea

issues outstanding against HCA and certain issues involving
Federal civil claims by, or on behalf of, the government against
HCA relating to DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing and
home health issues. The civil issues that were not covered by
the Civil Agreement included claims related to physician
relations, cost reports and wound care issues. The Civil
Agreement was approved by the Federal District Court of the
District of Columbia in August 2001. HCA paid the government
$900 million (including accrued interest of
$60 million), as provided by the Civil Agreement and Plea
Agreement, during 2001. In January 2001, HCA entered into an
eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with
the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
Human Services.

The remaining aspects of the investigations were
resolved during 2003. In June 2003, HCA announced that the
Company and the Civil Division of the DOJ had signed agreements,
documenting the understanding announced in December 2002,
whereby the United States would dismiss the various claims it
had brought related to physician relations, cost reports and
wound care issues (the “DOJ Agreement”). The DOJ
Agreement received court approval in July 2003, and HCA paid the
DOJ $641 million (including accrued interest of
$10 million) during July 2003. The DOJ Agreement does not
affect

qui tam

cases in which the government has not
intervened. HCA also finalized an agreement with a negotiating
team representing states that may have claims against the
Company. Under this agreement, HCA paid $17.7 million in
July 2003 to state Medicaid agencies to resolve these claims.
HCA also paid $33 million for legal fees of the private
parties. In connection with the DOJ Agreement, HCA recorded a
pretax charge of $603 million ($418 million after-tax)
in the fourth quarter of 2002. The consolidated income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes a pretax
favorable change in estimate of $41 million
($25 million after-tax) related to Medicaid cost report
balances for cost report years ended December 31, 1997 and
prior.

During June 2003, HCA announced that the Company
and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) had signed an agreement, documenting the
understanding announced in March 2002, to resolve all Medicare
cost report, home office cost statement and appeal issues
between HCA and CMS (the “CMS Agreement”) for cost
report periods ended before August 1, 2001. As a result of
the CMS Agreement, HCA paid CMS $250 million in June 2003.
HCA recorded a pretax charge of $260 million
($165 million after-tax) consisting of the accrual of
$250 million for the settlement payment and the write-off
of $10 million of net Medicare cost report receivables.
This charge was recorded in the consolidated income statement
for the year ended December 31, 2001.

During September 2003, HCA reached an
understanding with attorneys representing shareholder groups to
settle class action securities lawsuits originally filed in
1997. Under the understanding, HCA will establish a
$49.5 million settlement fund to pay class members based on
their individual claims. This settlement is subject to execution
of a definitive settlement agreement and approval by the United
States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. HCA
has also reached an understanding with its insurance carriers
under which the insurers will pay the majority of the settlement
amount.

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN
    GOVERNMENT CLAIMS (Continued)

HCA remains the subject of a December 1997 formal
order of investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”). HCA understands that the investigation
includes the anti-fraud, insider trading, periodic reporting and
internal accounting control provisions of the Federal securities
laws.

If HCA was found to be in violation of Federal or
state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs or
breach of the CIA, HCA could be subject to substantial monetary
fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such
sanctions or expenses could have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s financial position, results of operations and
liquidity.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, HCA recorded the
following pretax charges in connection with the governmental
investigations (dollars in millions):

The professional fees related to investigations
represent incremental legal and accounting expenses that are
recognized on the basis of when the costs are incurred.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS

During 2003 and 2002, HCA acquired various
hospitals and health care entities (or controlling interests in
such entities). The purchase price for each of these
transactions was allocated to the related assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
operations of acquired entities for periods subsequent to the
respective acquisition dates.

The following is a summary of hospitals and other
health care entities acquired during 2003 and 2002 (dollars in
millions):

The purchase price paid in excess of the fair
value of identifiable net assets of acquired entities aggregated
$491 million in 2003 and $32 million in 2002. During
April 2003, HCA completed the acquisition of the Health Midwest
hospital system in Kansas City, and the results of operations of
the Health Midwest facilities were consolidated with those of
HCA beginning April 1, 2003. Pursuant to the transaction,
HCA will spend or commit to spend $450 million in capital
expenditures over the next five years. The pro forma effect of
HCA’s acquisitions on its results of operations for the
periods prior to the respective acquisition dates was not
significant.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS (Continued)

During 2003, HCA recognized a pretax gain of
$85 million ($49 million after-tax) on the sales of
two leased hospitals and two consolidating hospitals. During
2002, HCA recognized a net pretax gain of $6 million
($4 million after-tax) on the sales of two consolidating
hospitals. During 2001, HCA recognized a net pretax gain of
$131 million ($76 million after-tax) on the sales of
three consolidating hospitals, HCA’s interests in two
non-consolidating hospitals and a provider of specialty managed
care benefit programs. Proceeds from the sales were used to
repay bank borrowings.

NOTE 4 — IMPAIRMENTS OF
LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue
activities associated with the internal development of a patient
accounts receivable management system, resulting in a pretax
charge of $130 million ($79 million after-tax). HCA
reduced the carrying value for capitalized costs associated with
the patient accounts receivable management system components
that were discontinued. The impact of the discontinued
activities on HCA’s operations was not significant.

During 2002, management decided to delay the
development and implementation of certain financial and
procurement information system components of its enterprise
resource planning program to concentrate and direct efforts to
the patient accounting and human resources information system
components. HCA reduced the carrying value for certain
capitalized costs associated with the information system
components that were delayed, resulting in a pretax charge of
$19 million. The impact of the delayed development
activities on HCA’s operations was not significant.

During 2001, HCA reduced the carrying value for
its investment in a nonhospital, equity method joint venture to
fair value, based upon estimates of sales value, resulting in a
pretax charge of $17 million ($10 million after-tax).
This joint venture’s impact on HCA’s operations was
not significant.

The asset impairment charges did not have a
significant impact on the Company’s cash flows and are not
expected to significantly impact cash flows for future periods.
The impairment charges affected HCA’s “corporate and
other” operating segment and affected HCA’s asset and
liability categories, as follows (dollars in millions):

NOTE 5 — IMPAIRMENT OF
INVESTMENT SECURITIES

During 2002, HCA recorded an other-than-temporary
impairment charge on investment securities of $168 million.
The investment securities on which the impairment charge was
recorded were primarily equity securities held by HCA’s
insurance subsidiary. These investments are classified as
“available-for-sale,” and are carried at fair value,
with changes in temporary unrealized gains and losses recorded
as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair value of
investments is generally based on quoted market prices.

During the third quarter of 2002, HCA’s
equity investment portfolio experienced an increase in
unrealized losses from $135 million at June 30, 2002
to $214 million at September 30, 2002. The portfolio
decline during the third quarter of 2002, combined with a
perception of the trends developing in the emphasis of amount of
decline and time period in the other-than-temporary impairment
review process and the consideration of possible alternatives
regarding the Company’s equity investment strategy, caused
management to determine that it had become difficult to overcome
the presumption that the identified investment

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 5 — IMPAIRMENT OF
INVESTMENT SECURITIES (Continued)

securities would not recover fair value equal to
cost prior to implementing any of the investment alternatives
being considered and that a $168 million
other-than-temporary impairment charge should be recognized in
the third quarter of 2002. The investment securities on which
the impairment charge was recognized were primarily concentrated
in the communications and technology industries.
Management’s review of the individual investment securities
included considerations of the amount of market decline, the
length of time the securities had been in a decline position and
issuer-specific financial attributes. See
Note 8 — Investments of Insurance Subsidiary, for
a summary of HCA’s insurance subsidiary investment
securities. The impairment charge affected the “Investments
of insurance subsidiary” asset category and the
“corporate and other” operating segment.

Deferred income taxes of $534 million and
$568 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, are included in other current assets. Noncurrent
deferred income tax liabilities totaled $828 million and
$292 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The tax benefits associated with nonqualified
stock options increased the current tax receivable by
$31 million, $82 million, and $60 million in
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Such benefits were recorded
as increases to stockholders’ equity.

At December 31, 2003, state net operating
loss carryforwards (expiring in years 2004 through 2022)
available to offset future taxable income approximated
$181 million. Utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards in any one year may be limited and, in certain
cases, result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Net
deferred tax assets related to such carryforwards are not
significant.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals
Division of the IRS, the United States Tax Court (the “Tax
Court”), the United States Court of Federal Claims, and the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (the
“Sixth Circuit”) certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2000 Federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 Federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1987 through 1988 and 1991 through 1993 Federal income tax
returns and Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital
Company’s (“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994
Federal income tax returns.

During 2001, HCA filed an appeal with the Sixth
Circuit with respect to two Tax Court decisions received in 1996
related to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of
America’s 1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns,
contesting Tax Court decisions related to the method that
Hospital Corporation of America used to calculate its tax
reserve for doubtful accounts and the timing of deferred income
recognition in connection with its sales of certain subsidiaries
to Healthtrust. During 2003, a three-judge panel of the Sixth
Circuit affirmed these Tax Court decisions. HCA is reviewing the
Sixth Circuit’s decision and considering whether to
undertake further appeals. Because of the volume and complexity
of calculating the tax allowance

F-20


HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 6 — INCOME TAXES
(Continued)

for doubtful accounts, the IRS has not determined
the amount of additional tax and interest that it may claim for
subsequent taxable periods.

Other disputed items include the timing of
recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000, the
amount of insurance expense deducted in 1999 and 2000, and the
amount of gain or loss recognized on the divestiture of certain
non-core business units in 1998. The IRS is claiming an
additional $381 million in income taxes and interest with
respect to these issues through December 31, 2003.

During 2001, HCA and the IRS filed Stipulated
Settlements with the Tax Court regarding the IRS’ proposed
disallowance of certain financing costs, systems conversion
costs and insurance premiums, which were deducted in calculating
taxable income, and the allocation of costs among fixed assets
and goodwill in connection with certain hospitals acquired by
HCA in 1995 and 1996. The settlement resulted in HCA’s
payment of additional tax and interest of $16 million and
had no impact on results of operations.

The IRS has begun an examination of HCA’s
2001 through 2002 Federal income tax returns. HCA is presently
unable to estimate the amount of any additional income tax and
interest that the IRS may claim upon completion of this
examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have
been recorded to satisfy final resolution of the disputed
issues. Management believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation
of America and Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and
paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements
established with the IRS during previous examinations and that
final resolution of these disputes will not have a material
adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
position.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
investments of HCA’s insurance subsidiary were classified
as “available for sale.” The aggregate common stock
investment is comprised of 370 equity positions at
December 31, 2003, with 348 positions reflecting
unrealized gains and 22 positions reflecting unrealized losses
(none of the individual unrealized loss positions exceed
$2 million). None of the equity positions with unrealized
losses at December 31, 2003 represent situations where
there is a continuous decline of more than 20% from cost for
more than one year. The equity positions (including those with
unrealized losses) at December 31, 2003, are not
concentrated in a particular industry.

Scheduled maturities of investments in debt

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

HCA has entered into interest rate swap
agreements to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates. These swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments between two parties based on
common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.
Pay-floating swaps effectively convert fixed rate obligations to
LIBOR indexed variable rate instruments. The notional amounts
and timing of interest payments in these agreements match the
related liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis.

The following table sets forth HCA’s
interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2003 (dollars

HCA’s revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) is a $1.75 billion agreement
expiring April 2006. As of December 31, 2003, HCA had
$510 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.

As of December 2003, interest is payable
generally at either LIBOR plus 0.7% to 1.5% (depending on
HCA’s credit ratings), the prime lending rate or a
competitive bid rate. The Credit Facility contains customary
covenants which include (i) limitations on debt levels,
(ii) limitations on sales of assets, mergers and changes of
ownership and (iii) maintenance of minimum interest
coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2003, HCA was in
compliance with all such covenants.

Significant Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious
industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and
regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be
instituted or asserted against the Company (see
Note 2 — Investigations and Settlement of Certain
Government Claims). The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
or legal and regulatory proceedings could materially, adversely
affect HCA’s results of operations and financial position
in a given period.

General Liability Claims

HCA is subject to claims and suits arising in the
ordinary course of business, including claims for personal
injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
the claimants may seek punitive damages against HCA, which may
not be covered by insurance. It is management’s opinion
that the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on
HCA’s results of operations or financial position.

except for voting rights. All nonvoting common stockholders may
convert their shares on a one-for-one basis into voting common
stock, subject to certain limitations.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In April 2003, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase $1.5 billion of its common stock. HCA expects to
repurchase its shares through open market purchases or privately
negotiated transactions. During 2003, HCA, through open market
purchases, repurchased under this authorization
25.3 million shares of its common stock for
$900 million.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to
repurchase up to 12 million shares of its common stock.
During 2002, HCA made open market purchases of 6.2 million
shares for $282 million. During 2003, HCA purchased
5.8 million shares for $214 million, which completed
the repurchases under this authorization. The repurchases were
intended to offset the dilutive effect of employee stock benefit
plans.

In October 2001, HCA announced an authorization
to repurchase up to $250 million of its common stock.
During 2001, HCA made open market purchases of 6.4 million
shares for $250 million, completing the repurchase
authorization.

During 2001, HCA entered into an agreement with a
financial institution that resulted in the financial institution
investing $400 million (at December 31, 2001) to
capitalize an entity that would acquire HCA common stock. This
consolidated affiliate acquired 16.8 million shares of HCA
common stock in connection with HCA’s settlement of certain
forward purchase contracts. In June 2002, HCA repaid the
financial institution and received the 16.8 million shares
of the Company’s common stock. The financial
institution’s investment in the consolidated affiliate was
reflected in HCA’s balance sheet at December 31, 2001,
as “Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable securities of
affiliate holding solely Company securities.” The quarterly
return on their investment, based upon a LIBOR plus
125 basis points return rate during 2001 and a LIBOR plus
87.5 basis points return rate during 2002, was recorded as
minority interest expense.

In March 2000, HCA announced that its Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of
its common stock. During 2001, HCA settled forward purchase
contracts representing 19.6 million shares at a cost of
$677 million, purchased 1.1 million shares through
open market purchases at a cost of $40 million and received
$17 million in premiums from the sale of put options,
completing the repurchase authorization.

In November 1999, HCA announced that its Board of
Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of
its common stock. During 2001, HCA settled the remaining forward
purchase contracts associated with its November 1999
authorization, representing 15.7 million shares at a cost
of $461 million.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the share repurchase
transactions reduced stockholders’ equity by
$1.114 billion, $282 million and $738 million,
respectively.

(share amounts in thousands):

HCA’s amended and restated Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) provides an opportunity to
purchase shares of its common stock at a discount (through
payroll deductions over six-month periods) to substantially all
employees. In May 2001, HCA stockholders approved an
increase to the number of shares that may be issued pursuant to
the ESPP by 10,000,000 shares. At December 31, 2003,
8,368,200 shares of common stock were reserved for
HCA’s employee stock purchase plan.

Under the 2000 Plan and the Management Stock
Purchase Plan (“MSPP”), HCA has made grants of
restricted shares or units of HCA’s common stock to provide
incentive compensation to employees. Performance equity plan
grants are made annually, based on the achievement of specified
performance goals. These shares have a two-year vesting period
with half the shares vesting at the end of the first year and
the remainder vesting at the end of the second year. The MSPP
allows eligible employees to defer an elected percentage (not to
exceed 25%) of their base salaries through the purchase of
restricted stock at a 25% discount from the average market
price. Purchases of restricted shares are made twice a year and
the shares vest after three years.

At December 31, 2003, 1,739,400 shares
were subject to restrictions, which lapse between 2004 and 2006.
During 2003, 2002 and 2001, grants and purchases of 1,039,900,
870,900 and 857,500 shares, respectively, were made at
weighted-average grant or purchase date fair values of $42.08,
$42.72 and $35.78 per share, respectively, related to the
performance equity plan. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, grants and
purchases of 148,900, 113,300, 112,000 shares,
respectively, were made at weighted-average grant or purchase
date discounted (25% discount) fair values of $30.21, $32.77 and

employee service. Retirement plan expense was
$166 million for 2003, $140 million for 2002 and
$128 million for 2001. Amounts approximately equal to
retirement plan expense are funded annually.

HCA maintains various contributory benefit plans
that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
requirements. Certain of the plans require that HCA match
certain percentages of participants’ contributions up to
certain maximum levels (generally 50% of the first 3% of
compensation deferred by participants). The cost of these plans
totaled $48 million for 2003, $47 million for 2002 and
$41 million for 2001. HCA’s contributions are funded
periodically during each year.

During 2001 HCA adopted a Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan (“SERP”) for certain executives. The
plan is designed to ensure that upon retirement the participant
receives a prescribed life annuity from a combination of the
SERP and HCA’s other benefit plans. Compensation expense
under the plan was $7 million for 2003, $9 million for
2002 and $2 million for 2001. Accrued benefits liabilities
under this plan totaled $44 million at December 31,
2003, and $30 million at December 31, 2002.

HCA maintains certain defined benefit pension
plans that resulted from acquisitions of certain hospitals in
prior years. Compensation expense under these plans was
$17 million for 2003, $8 million for 2002, and
$2 million for 2001. Accrued benefits liabilities under
these plans totaled $19 million at December 31, 2003,
and $22 million at December 31, 2002.

NOTE 15 — SEGMENT AND
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

HCA operates in one line of business, which is
operating hospitals and related health care entities. During all
three years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
approximately 28% of HCA’s revenues related to patients
participating in the Medicare program.

HCA’s operations are structured in two
geographically organized groups: the Eastern Group includes
91 consolidating hospitals located in the Eastern United
States and the Western Group includes 85 consolidating
hospitals located in the Western United States. HCA also
operates eight consolidating hospitals in England and
Switzerland and these facilities are included in the Corporate
and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income
before depreciation and amortization, interest expense,
settlement with government agencies, gains on sales of
facilities, impairment of investment securities, impairment of
long-lived assets, investigation related costs, loss on
retirement of debt, minority interests and income taxes. HCA
uses adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for
purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and
assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly
used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry,
and also serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt
service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be
considered as a measure of financial performance under generally
accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from
adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in
understanding and assessing financial performance. Because
adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is
thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment
EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies. The geographic
