PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in
    the United States. At December 31, 2008, we operated 166
    hospitals, comprised of 160 general, acute care hospitals; five
    psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. The 166
    hospital total includes eight hospitals (seven general, acute
    care hospitals and one rehabilitation hospital) owned by joint
    ventures in which an affiliate of HCA is a partner, and these
    joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. In
    addition, we operated 105 freestanding surgery centers, eight of
    which are owned by joint ventures in which an affiliate of HCA
    is a partner, and these joint ventures are accounted for using
    the equity method. Our facilities are located in 20 states
    and England. The terms “Company,” “HCA,”
    “we,” “our” or “us,” as used
    herein, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise
    stated or indicated by context. The term “affiliates”
    means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and
    partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
    partners. The terms “facilities” or
    “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
    affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to
    employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of
    quality health care services in the most cost-effective manner
    possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a
    full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties
    as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology,
    neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic
    and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care
    services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals,
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and
    rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
    full range of mental health care services through inpatient,
    partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
    reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal
    executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville,
    Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is

(615) 344-9551.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. completed its merger (the
    “Merger”) with Hercules Acquisition Corporation,
    pursuant to which the Company was acquired by Hercules Holding
    II, LLC (“Hercules Holding”), a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group comprised of
    affiliates of Bain Capital Partners (“Bain”), Kohlberg
    Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”), Merrill Lynch
    Global Private Equity (“MLGPE”) (each a
    “Sponsor”) and affiliates of HCA founder,
    Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., (the “Frist Entities,”
    and together with the Sponsors, the “Investors”), and
    by members of management and certain other investors. The
    Merger, the financing transactions related to the Merger and
    other related transactions are collectively referred to in this
    annual report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger
    was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial
    statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our
    assets and liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees and certain other
    investors. On April 29, 2008, we registered our common
    stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended, thus subjecting us to the reporting
    requirements of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended. Our common stock is not traded on a
    national securities exchange.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

•

maintain our dedication to the care and improvement of human
    life;

•

maintain our commitment to ethics and compliance;

•

leverage our leading local market positions;

•

expand our presence in key markets;

•

continue to leverage our scale;

•

continue to develop enduring physician relationships; and

•

become the health care employer of choice.

Health
    Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals; freestanding
    surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
    oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
    physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2008, we owned and operated 153 general,
    acute care hospitals with 38,014 licensed beds, and an
    additional seven general, acute care hospitals with 2,267
    licensed beds are operated through joint ventures, which are
    accounted for using the equity method. Most of our general,
    acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services,
    including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care,
    diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute
    care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as
    outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy,
    cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized
    medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board,
    made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical
    research and education programs. However, some of our hospitals
    are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the
    clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other
    education programs.

At December 31, 2008, we operated five psychiatric
    hospitals with 490 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
    provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and
    adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug
    abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities which include
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers,
    comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
    centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
    various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
    integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive
    health care networks in select communities. A majority of our
    surgery centers are operated through partnerships or limited
    liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership
    or limited liability company typically held by a general partner
    or subsidiary that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management
    services to our health care facilities, including patient safety
    programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply
    contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing contracts;
    accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental
    reimbursement assistance; construction planning and
    coordination; information technology systems and solutions;
    legal counsel; human resources services; and internal audit
    services.



Sources
    of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
    provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
    the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
    reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
    depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
    medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the
    geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels
    fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
    control.

We receive payment for patient services from the federal
    government under the Medicare program, state governments under
    their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care
    plans, private insurers and directly from patients. The
    approximate percentages of our revenues from such sources were
    as follows:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
    medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
    disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and
    persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a
    federal-state program, administered by the states, which
    provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals
    who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute
    care hospitals located in the United States are certified as
    health care services providers for persons covered under
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare
    and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than
    established hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges
    to certain group purchasers of health care services, including
    private insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other
    managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit our
    ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs.
    See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
    Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
    between established hospital gross charges and amounts
    reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs or
    PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the
    extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of
    their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
    coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due
    from individuals is typically more difficult than from
    governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to
    uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
    care under our charity care policy. These discounts are similar
    to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an
    uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
    uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

Inpatient
    Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a
    prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
    care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient
    PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are
    established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare
    severity-diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Effective
    October 1, 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
    Services (“CMS”) began a two-year transition to full
    implementation of MS-DRGs to replace the previously used
    Medicare diagnosis related groups (“DRGs”) in an
    effort to better recognize severity of illness in Medicare
    payment rates. This change represents a refinement to the
    existing DRG system. MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
    according to the estimated



intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for
    each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average
    resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources
    for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage
    differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as
    “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital
    costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically
    adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients
    falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically
    receive additional “outlier” payments.

MS-DRG rates are updated and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated
    each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index
    used to update the MS-DRG rates (the “market basket”)
    gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals
    and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing
    goods and services. In federal fiscal year 2008, the MS-DRG rate
    was increased by the full market basket of 3.3%. For the federal
    fiscal year 2009, CMS set the MS-DRG rate increase at full
    market basket of 3.6%.

In August 2006, CMS changed the methodology used to recalibrate
    the DRG weights from charge-based weights to cost relative
    weights under a three-year transition period beginning in
    federal fiscal year 2007. The adoption of the cost relative
    weights is not anticipated to have a material financial impact
    on us. Beginning October 1, 2008, MS-DRG weights are
    calculated using 100% cost relative weights.

Effective October 1, 2007, CMS imposed a documentation and
    coding adjustment to account for changes in payments under the
    new MS-DRG system that are not related to changes in case mix.
    Through legislative refinement, the documentation and coding
    adjustments for federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 are
    reductions to the base payment rate of 0.6% and 0.9%,
    respectively, for a cumulative reduction of 1.5%. However,
    Congress has given CMS the ability to determine retrospectively
    whether the documentation and coding adjustment levels for
    federal fiscal years 2008 and 2009 were adequate to account for
    changes in payments not related to changes in case mix. If the
    levels are found to have been inadequate, CMS can impose an
    adjustment to payments for federal fiscal years 2010, 2011 and
    2012.

Further realignments in the MS-DRG system could also reduce the
    payments we receive for certain specialties, including
    cardiology and orthopedics. CMS has focused on payment levels
    for such specialties in recent years in part because of the
    proliferation of specialty hospitals. Changes in the payments
    received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on
    our revenues.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
    Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provided for DRG rate increases
    for certain federal fiscal years at full market basket if data
    for 10 patient care quality indicators were submitted to
    the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
    (“HHS”). The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA
    2005”) expanded and provided for the future expansion of
    the number of quality measures that must be reported to receive
    a full market basket update. CMS has published final rules that
    expand to 44 the number of quality measures that hospitals are
    required to report, beginning with discharges occurring in
    calendar year 2009, in order to qualify for the full market
    basket update to the inpatient prospective payment system in
    federal fiscal year 2010. Failure to submit the required quality
    indicators will result in a two percentage point reduction to
    the market basket update. All of our hospitals paid under
    Medicare inpatient MS-DRG PPS are participating in the quality
    initiative by the Secretary of HHS by submitting the requested
    quality data. While we will endeavor to comply with all data
    submission requirements as additional requirements continue to
    be added, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient
    to entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of
    our hospitals.

As part of CMS’s goal of transforming Medicare from a
    passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and
    services, beginning October 1, 2007, CMS requires hospitals
    to submit information on general acute care inpatient Medicare
    claims specifying whether diagnoses were present on admission
    (“POA”). For discharges occurring after
    October 1, 2008, Medicare no longer assigns an inpatient
    hospital discharge to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected
    hospital-acquired condition (“HAC”) was not POA. In
    this situation, the case would be paid as though the secondary
    diagnosis was not present. Currently, there are ten categories
    of conditions on the list of HACs. On January 15, 2009, CMS
    announced three National Coverage Determinations
    (“NCDs”) that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for
    erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or
    outpatient basis. These three erroneous surgical procedures are
    in addition to the HACs designated in CMS regulations. These
    changes are not expected to have a material effect on our
    revenues or cash flows.



Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of
    Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. CMS
    estimates that outlier payments accounted for 4.64% and 4.65% of
    total operating DRG payments for federal fiscal years 2007 and
    2006, respectively. For federal fiscal year 2008, CMS
    established an outlier threshold of $22,185, which resulted in
    outlier payments estimated by CMS to be 4.70% of total operating
    DRG payments. For federal fiscal year 2009, CMS has established
    an outlier threshold of $20,045. We do not anticipate that the
    change to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2009
    will have a material impact on our revenues.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
    Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
    who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS continues
    to use fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and
    speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic
    laboratory services and nonimplantable orthotics and
    prosthetics, freestanding surgery centers services and services
    provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into
    groups called ambulatory payment classifications
    (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
    and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
    established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
    hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
    The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2008 and
    2007 by market baskets of 3.30% and 3.40%, respectively. On
    November 18, 2008 CMS published a final rule that updated
    payment rates for calendar year 2009 by the full market basket
    of 3.60%. CMS continues to require that hospitals submit quality
    data relating to outpatient care to receive the full market
    basket increase under the outpatient PPS in calendar year 2010.
    CMS requires that data on eleven quality measures be submitted
    in calendar year 2009 for the payment determination in calendar
    year 2010. Hospitals that fail to submit such data will receive
    the market basket update minus two percentage points for the
    outpatient PPS.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities
    (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under IRF PPS, patients are
    classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
    comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the
    patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a
    predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
    patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
    levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
    For federal fiscal years 2008 and 2007, CMS updated the PPS rate
    for rehabilitation hospitals and units by market baskets of 3.2%
    and 3.3%, respectively. However, CMS also applied a reduction to
    the standard payment amount of 2.6% for federal fiscal year 2007
    to account for coding changes that do not reflect real changes
    in case mix. The Medicare, Medicaid and State Children’s
    Health Insurance Program (“SCHIP”) Reauthorization Act
    of 2007 eliminated the market basket update as of April 1,
    2008 and continues the zero update through federal fiscal year
    2009. As of December 31, 2008, we had one rehabilitation
    hospital, which is operated through a joint venture, and 47
    hospital rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
    criteria for being classified as an IRF, commonly known as the
    “75% rule.” If a facility fails to meet the 75% rule
    or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, it may be paid
    under the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which
    generally provide for lower payment amounts. Pursuant to the
    final 75% rule, a specified percentage of a facility’s
    inpatients over a given year must be treated for at least one of
    13 conditions. The final rule provided for a transition period
    during which the percentage threshold would increase, starting
    at a 50% compliance threshold and culminating at a 75%
    threshold, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after
    July 1, 2007. Since then, several adjustments have been
    made to the transition period. The passage of the Medicare,
    Medicaid and SCHIP Reauthorization Act of 2007 set the
    compliance threshold at 60% for cost reporting periods beginning
    on or after July 1, 2006. Implementation of the 75% rule
    has reduced our IRF admissions and can be expected to continue
    to restrict the treatment of patients whose medical conditions
    do not meet any of the 13 approved conditions.



Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals
    and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and
    critical access hospitals are reimbursed under a prospective
    payment system (“IPF PPS”), a per diem payment, with
    adjustments to account for certain patient and facility
    characteristics. IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy
    for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a
    facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service
    emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment
    rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral and has adopted a
    July 1 update cycle. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and
    long-term care (“RPL”) market basket update is used to
    update the IPF PPS. The annual RPL market basket update for rate
    year 2009 is 3.2%. As of December 31, 2008, we had five
    psychiatric hospitals and 31 hospital psychiatric units.

Ambulatory
    Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”)
    using a predetermined fee schedule. Effective January 1,
    2007, as a result of DRA 2005, reimbursements for ASC overhead
    costs were limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to
    hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital
    outpatient PPS for the same procedure. On August 2, 2007,
    CMS issued final regulations that changed payments for
    procedures performed in an ASC. Effective January 1, 2008,
    ASC payment groups increased from nine clinically disparate
    payment groups to an extensive list of covered surgical
    procedures among the APCs used under the outpatient PPS for
    these surgical services. CMS estimates that the rates for
    procedures performed in an ASC setting equal 65% of the
    corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an
    outpatient hospital setting. Moreover, if CMS determines that a
    procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office,
    the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the
    reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician
    Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. In addition, all surgical
    procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk
    or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC
    procedures. This rule expands the number of procedures that
    Medicare will pay for if performed in an ASC. Because the new
    payment system has a significant impact on payments for certain
    procedures, the final rule establishes a four-year transition
    period for implementing the required payment rates. This change
    may result in more Medicare procedures that are now performed in
    hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our
    hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed
    in ASCs may be moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial
    third-party payers may adopt similar policies.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area
    differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
    reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area
    compared to the national average wage level. Beginning in
    federal fiscal year 2007, CMS adjusted 100% of the wage index
    factor for occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage
    index changes, while slightly negative in the aggregate, is not
    anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2009.

The Medicare program reimburses 70% of bad debts related to
    deductibles and coinsurance for patients with Medicare coverage,
    after the provider has made a reasonable effort to collect these
    amounts. On March 30, 2006, the United States District
    Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final order
    in

Battle Creek Health System v. Thompson,

which
    provided that reasonable collection efforts have not been
    satisfied as long as the Medicare accounts remained with an
    external collection agency. On appeal, the United States Court
    of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the lower court’s
    decision. We incur substantial amounts of Medicare bad debts
    every year that could be subject to the

Battle Creek

decision. We utilize extensive in-house and external
    collection efforts for our accounts receivable, including
    deductible and coinsurance amounts owed by patients with
    Medicare coverage. We utilize a secondary collection agency
    after in-house and primary collection agency efforts have been
    unsuccessful. During 2007, we modified our accounts receivable
    collection processes to provide us with reasonable collection
    results and comply with CMS’s interpretation of reasonable
    collection efforts. Possible future changes in judicial and
    administrative interpretations of law and regulations governing
    Medicare could disrupt our collections processes, increase our
    costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.



As required by the MMA, CMS is implementing contractor reform
    whereby CMS has competitively bid the Medicare fiscal
    intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare
    Administrative Contractors (“MACs”). Hospital
    companies have the option to work with the selected MAC in the
    jurisdiction where a given hospital is located or, in the case
    of chain providers, to use the MAC in the jurisdiction where the
    hospital company’s home office is located. For chain
    providers, either all hospitals in the chain must choose to stay
    with the MAC chosen for their locality or all hospitals must opt
    to use the home office MAC. HCA has chosen to use the MACs
    assigned to the localities in which our hospitals are located.
    Recently, CMS has completed the process of awarding contracts on
    all 15 MAC jurisdictions. Individual MAC jurisdictions are in
    varying phases of transition. For the transition periods and for
    a potentially unforeseen period thereafter, all of these changes
    could impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash
    flow; however, we are unable to predict the impact at this time.

The MMA established the Recovery Audit Contractor
    (“RAC”) three-year demonstration program to conduct
    post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in
    the

fee-for-service

Medicare program. Beginning in 2005, CMS contracted with three
    different RACs to conduct these reviews in California, Florida
    and New York. The program was expanded in August 2007 to include
    Arizona, Massachusetts and South Carolina. Each RAC had
    discretion over the types of reviews and record requests it
    would conduct within the states for which it was responsible as
    long as it followed the CMS-defined Statement of Work. HCA had
    46 hospitals located in the demonstration areas, and 44 of these
    hospitals had a review performed. The Tax Relief and Health Care
    Act of 2006 made the RAC program permanent and mandated its
    nationwide expansion by 2010. CMS has awarded contracts to four
    RACs that will implement the permanent RAC program on a
    nationwide basis. The final impact of the demonstration program
    and the permanent, nationwide program cannot be quantified at
    this time.

Managed
    Medicare

Managed Medicare plans relate to situations where a private
    company contracts with CMS to provide members with Medicare
    Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed
    Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs, or private

fee-for-service

plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries to choose
    enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. In 2003 changes to
    federal law increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans
    and limited, to some extent, the financial risk to the companies
    offering the plans. Following these changes, the number of
    beneficiaries choosing to receive their Medicare benefits
    through such plans has increased. However, the Medicare
    Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 reduced
    payments to managed Medicare plans, and CMS has recently
    proposed additional cuts in payments to managed Medicare plans.
    Future changes may result in reduced premium payments to managed
    Medicare plans and may lead to decreased enrollment in such
    plans.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government
    and the states and are administered by states under approved
    plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
    or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual
    hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a
    hospital’s cost of services. The federal government and
    many states are currently considering altering the level of
    Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
    eligibility that could adversely affect future levels of
    Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. As permitted
    by law, certain states in which we operate have adopted
    broad-based provider taxes to fund their Medicaid programs.

Since many states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. DRA 2005
    includes Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion over
    five years. A congressional committee has estimated that
    additional proposed legislative and regulatory changes, if
    implemented, would reduce federal Medicaid funding by an
    additional $49.7 billion over five years. The
    implementation of many of these proposed changes is subject to a
    statutorily mandated moratorium scheduled to expire in July
    2009. States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation
    designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll
    Medicaid recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems. Future legislation or other
    changes in the administration or interpretation of government
    health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.



Managed
    Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or
    more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims
    adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program
    responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core
    benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of
    the designated entities, usually a managed care organization.
    The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent
    years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid
    programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in
    which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to
    these plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans.

TRICARE

In December 2008, the Department of Defense implemented a
    prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services
    furnished to TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for
    services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the
    Medicare outpatient prospective payment system APC rates have
    historically been below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this
    payment methodology for TRICARE beneficiaries will reduce our
    reimbursement. This change in TRICARE will have a material
    impact on our revenues from this program; however, TRICARE
    outpatient services do not represent a significant portion of
    our patient volumes. The TRICARE outpatient payment rule has
    been reopened for comment and the effective date delayed until
    May 1, 2009. Further modification to the new outpatient
    system may be made.

Annual
    Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
    TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
    under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
    requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
    require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
    revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
    provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
    recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
    adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us
    under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require
    several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to
    or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of
    appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
    cost reports.

Managed
    Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges
    to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
    including managed care plans and private insurance companies.
    Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other
    insurers were 35%, 37% and 36% of our total admissions for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms
    between one and three years. While we generally received annual
    average yield increases of 6% to 7% from managed care payers
    during 2008, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    receive increases in the future.

Hospital
    Utilization

We believe that the most important factors relating to the
    overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
    position of the hospital and the number and quality of
    physicians and other health care professionals providing patient
    care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a
    hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
    services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and
    convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that
    impact utilization include the growth in local population, local
    economic conditions and market penetration of managed care
    programs.



The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
    our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are
    subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in
    patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the
    cold weather months. The data set forth in this table includes
    only those facilities that are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
    most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered
    by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of
    freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic centers (including
    facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which
    we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our
    hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some
    cases, competing hospitals are more established than our
    hospitals. Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported
    government agencies and many others are owned by

not-for-profit

entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable
    contributions and/or tax revenues, and are exempt from sales,
    property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not
    available to our hospitals. In certain localities there are
    large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized
    facilities, equipment and services which may not be available at
    most of our hospitals. We are facing increasing competition from
    physician-owned specialty hospitals and both our own and
    unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in
    high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas
    outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric
    hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals,
    including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
    competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local
    communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality
    of care; ability to attract and retain quality physicians,
    skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals;
    location; breadth of services; technology offered and prices
    charged. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient
    services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
    for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for
    physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
    of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
    affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may at any
    time terminate their affiliation with a hospital we operate, our
    hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on
    the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other
    qualified physicians. We believe that physicians refer patients
    to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services
    it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians
    on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the
    quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and
    employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide
    quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for
    physicians and patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
    is our ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of
    group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct
    and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts
    from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition,
    employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to
    contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed
    care programs and discounts from established gross charges.
    Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group
    health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market
    reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services,
    quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success
    will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our
    managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts
    on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our
    ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate
    increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and
    conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate
    exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise
    restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with
    us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers
    tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures.
    The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care
    organizations varies from community to community, depending on
    the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
    limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
    services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
    make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
    restricting competition. Before issuing a CON, these states
    consider the need for additional or expanded health care
    facilities or services. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. In those states
    which have no CON laws or which set relatively high levels of
    expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities,
    competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital
    spending is more prevalent. See Item 1,
    “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”



We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of
    continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
    rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
    medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
    and interpretations, and managed care contracting for provider
    services by private and government payers remain ongoing
    challenges.

Admissions and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively
    affected by payer-required preadmission authorization,
    utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and
    alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill
    patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer
    pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we
    intend to expand our facilities or acquire or construct new
    facilities where appropriate, to better enable the provision of
    a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer discounts to
    private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and
    offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation
    and Other Factors

Licensure,
    Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
    numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the
    adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
    policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
    prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
    environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
    assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
    for licensing and accreditation. We believe that our health care
    facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
    All of our general, acute care hospitals are certified for
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are
    accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose
    its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its
    certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the
    facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. Management believes our
    facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable
    federal, state, local and independent review body regulations
    and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and
    accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain
    qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements
    for licensure also may include notification or approval in the
    event of the transfer or change of ownership. Failure to obtain
    the necessary state approval in these circumstances can result
    in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of
    ownership.

Certificates
    of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care
    facilities, the construction or expansion of health care
    facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer
    or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services
    may be subject to review by and prior approval of state
    regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally
    require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need
    for additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
    Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
    inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
    change ownership.

State
    Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
    review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
    assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
    within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have
    not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
    Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that
    mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we
    will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states
    in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating
    such reviews.

Utilization
    Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that
    services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients
    meet professionally recognized standards, are medically
    necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed.
    These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of
    admissions of



Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality
    improvement organizations to assess the appropriateness of
    Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the
    quality of care provided, the validity of DRG classifications
    and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay
    or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for
    services provided, may assess fines and also have the authority
    to recommend to HHS that a provider, which is in substantial
    noncompliance with the appropriate standards, be excluded from
    participating in the Medicare program. Most nongovernmental
    managed care organizations also require utilization review.

Federal
    Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
    and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
    the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
    hospital’s participation in the federal health care
    programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
    be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
    or both.

Anti-kickback
    Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
    “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
    from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
    paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
    or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care
    program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly.
    Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a
    criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or
    imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
    violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of
    the remuneration

and/or

exclusion from participation in federal health care programs,
    including Medicare and Medicaid. Courts have held that there is
    a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of
    the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are
    other lawful purposes.

The Office of Inspector General at HHS (“OIG”), among
    other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
    eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
    mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
    and inspections. As one means of providing guidance to health
    care providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
    These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
    of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the
    arrangements or transactions violate the Anti-kickback Statute
    or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified
    several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect
    practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a
    hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital,
    (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office
    space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the
    hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted
    billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training
    for a physician’s office staff in areas such as management
    techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which
    provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a
    predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
    remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or
    loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to
    the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a
    physician’s travel and expenses for conferences,
    (h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance
    plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician,
    (i) payment for services (which may include consultations
    at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties
    by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from
    physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, and
    (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than
    fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which
    physicians refer. The OIG has encouraged persons having
    information about hospitals who offer the above types of
    incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of
    providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins,
    along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain
    arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities, including:
    (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
    venture arrangements between those in a position to refer
    business, such as physicians, and those providing items or
    services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and
    (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the
    practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
    hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
    the physician’s efforts.



In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory
    Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for
    certain types of health care providers. In January 2005, the OIG
    published Supplemental Compliance Guidance for Hospitals,
    supplementing its 1998 guidance for the hospital industry. In
    the supplemental guidance, the OIG identifies a number of risk
    areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations.
    These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with
    physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint
    venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
    regulations that outline categories of activities that are
    deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
    Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe
    harbors for various activities, including the following:
    investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
    practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management
    contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
    discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
    beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
    arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
    investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
    ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty
    services. The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does
    not fall within a safe harbor, or that it is identified in a
    fraud alert or advisory bulletin or as a risk area in the
    Supplemental Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals, does not
    automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal
    under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and
    business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and
    others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to
    our hospitals and other health care facilities, including
    employment contracts, leases and professional service
    agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians
    and facilities to which patients are referred from our
    facilities. In addition, we provide financial incentives,
    including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into
    the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to
    comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current
    arrangements, including joint ventures and financial
    relationships with physicians and other referral sources and
    persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify
    for safe harbor protection.

Although the Company believes that its arrangements with
    physicians and other referral sources have been structured to
    comply with current law and available interpretations, there can
    be no assurance that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws
    will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the
    Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse
    determination could subject the Company to liabilities under the
    Social Security Act, including criminal penalties, civil
    monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare,
    Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark
    Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
    as the “Stark Law.” This law effectively prohibits
    physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to
    entities with which they or any of their immediate family
    members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide
    certain “designated health services” that are
    reimbursable by Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient
    hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology
    services. The Stark Law also prevents the entity from billing a
    federal health program for any items or services that result
    from a prohibited referral and requires the entity to refund
    amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the
    prohibited referral. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law
    include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to
    $15,000 per prohibited service provided, and exclusion from the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute also provides for a
    penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme. There are
    exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the
    customary financial arrangements between physicians and
    providers, including employment contracts, leases and
    recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a
    physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, as
    opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department.
    Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which
    compliance is voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every
    requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in
    violation of the Stark Law.

CMS has issued three phases of final regulations implementing
    the Stark Law, as well as final regulations in the 2009
    Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”) final
    rule. Phases I, II and III became effective in
    January



2002, July 2004 and December 2007, respectively. Some portions
    of the 2009 IPPS Stark regulations became effective
    October 1, 2008, and other portions become effective
    October 1, 2009. While these regulations help clarify the
    requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear
    how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for
    enforcement purposes. The recent changes to the regulations
    implementing the Stark Law further restrict the types of
    arrangements that facilities and physicians may enter, including
    additional restrictions on certain leases, percentage
    compensation arrangements, and agreements under which a hospital
    purchases services “under arrangements.” We may be
    required to restructure or unwind some of our arrangements
    because of these changes. Because many of these laws and their
    implementing regulations are relatively new, we do not always
    have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial
    interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to
    structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark
    Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are
    detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every
    relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

In 2003, Congress passed legislation that modified the hospital
    ownership exception to the Stark Law by creating an

18-month

moratorium on allowing physicians to own interests in new
    specialty hospitals. The moratorium was extended by regulatory
    and legislative action and expired on August 8, 2006. At
    the conclusion of the moratorium, HHS announced that it will
    require hospitals to disclose certain financial arrangements
    with physicians. On September 14, 2007, CMS published an
    information collection request called the Disclosure of
    Financial Relationships Report (“DFRR”). HHS will
    initially select 400 hospitals that will be required to report
    the financial arrangements with physicians as required in the
    DFRR. Those hospitals are comprised of 290 hospitals that failed
    to respond to a previous voluntary CMS questionnaire about
    investments and compensation relationships and 110 additional
    hospitals. The DFRR and its supporting documentation are
    currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget
    and have not yet been released. CMS has indicated that
    responding hospitals will have a limited amount of time to
    compile a significant amount of information relating to their
    financial relationships with physicians. A hospital may be
    subject to substantial penalties if it is unable to assemble and
    report this information within the required time frame or if any
    applicable government agency determines that the submission is
    inaccurate or incomplete. Depending on the final format of the
    DFRR, responding hospitals may be subject to substantial
    penalties as a result of enforcement actions brought by
    government agencies and whistleblowers acting pursuant to the
    FCA and similar state laws, based on such allegations as failure
    to respond within required deadlines, that the response is
    inaccurate or contains incomplete information, or that the
    response indicates a potential violation of the Stark Law or
    other requirements.

Similar
    State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the
    Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for
    patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that
    prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws
    is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the source of
    payment for care, and little precedent exists for their
    interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide
    for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility
    licensure.

Other
    Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
    (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and
    abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care
    fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The
    Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties
    for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid.
    False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for
    services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
    rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
    unnecessary goods and services, and cost report fraud. Federal
    enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare
    and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees
    associated with business entities that have committed health
    care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no
    knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be
    imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including
    failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing
    arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in
    excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration
    to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection
    of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or
    entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program,
    making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or
    limit services, and soliciting or



receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual
    for an item or service payable by a federal healthcare program.
    Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad.
    To avoid liability, providers must, among other things,
    carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, as well
    as accurately prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary
    Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud
    and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil
    monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and
    in some cases may result in penalties of up to three times the
    remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition,
    a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state
    healthcare programs. Federal and state governments increasingly
    use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where
    they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof
    requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further,
    individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information
    on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at
    least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity
    Program.

The
    Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

The

qui tam,

or whistleblower, provisions of the federal
    False Claims Act (“FCA”) allow private individuals to
    bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the
    defendant has defrauded the federal government. Further, the
    government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other
    government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing
    for services not provided and submitting false cost reports.
    When a private party brings a

qui tam

action under the
    FCA, the defendant often will not be made aware of the lawsuit
    until the government commences its own investigation or makes a
    determination whether it will intervene. When a defendant is
    determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the
    defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages
    sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of
    between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. There
    are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability
    often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for
    reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the
    term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence
    will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a
    claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
    constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and,
    therefore, will qualify for liability.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have
    taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers
    who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the
    Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted
    false claims under the FCA. Every entity that receives at least
    $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written
    policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing
    detailed information about false claims, false statements and
    whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including
    the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law
    provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws that
    are comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we
    operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well
    as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private
    party may file a civil lawsuit in state court.

HIPAA
    Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security
    Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
    the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
    certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
    received electronically. These provisions are intended to
    encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
    has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
    Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
    is mandatory for our facilities. In January 2009, CMS published
    a final rule regarding updated standard code sets for certain
    diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets and related
    changes to the formats used for certain electronic transactions.
    While use of the ICD-10 code sets is not mandatory until
    October 1, 2013, we will be modifying our payment systems
    and processes to prepare for the implementation. In addition,
    HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider
    Identifier. While use of the ICD-10 code sets will require
    significant administrative changes, we believe that the cost of
    compliance with these regulations has not had and is not
    expected to have a material, adverse effect on our business,
    financial position or results of operations.



The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to
    HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of
    individually identifiable health information and require covered
    entities, including health plans, to implement administrative,
    physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of
    such information. Recently, the American Recovery and
    Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) broadened the scope
    of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Among other
    things, the ARRA provides that HHS must issue regulations
    requiring covered entities to report certain security breaches
    to individuals affected by the breach and, in some cases, to HHS
    or to the public via a website. This reporting obligation will
    apply broadly to breaches involving unsecured protected health
    information and will become effective 30 days from the date
    HHS issues these regulations. In addition, the ARRA extends the
    application of certain provisions of the security and privacy
    regulations to business associates (entities that handle
    identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities)
    and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties
    for violation of the regulations. We enforce a HIPAA compliance
    plan, which we believe complies with HIPAA privacy and security
    requirements and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors
    our compliance. The privacy regulations and security regulations
    have and will continue to impose significant costs on our
    facilities in order to comply with these standards.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may
    result in civil and criminal penalties, and the ARRA has
    strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, which may
    result in increased enforcement activity. Under the ARRA, HHS is
    required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered
    entities and their business associates. The ARRA broadens the
    applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of
    covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for
    violations resulting from willful neglect. The ARRA also
    significantly increases the amount of the civil penalties, with
    penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil
    penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the
    same requirement. In addition, the ARRA authorizes state
    attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either
    injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy
    and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state
    residents.

We remain subject to any state laws that relate to privacy or
    the reporting of security breaches that are more restrictive
    than the regulations issued under HIPAA and the requirements of
    the ARRA. For example, various state laws and regulations may
    require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data
    breach involving certain individually identifiable health or
    financial information. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission
    issued a final rule in October 2007 requiring financial
    institutions and creditors, which may include health providers
    and health plans, to implement written identity theft prevention
    programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in
    connection with certain accounts. The compliance date for this
    rule has been postponed until May 1, 2009.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical
    Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This
    federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare
    program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination
    of every individual who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are
    severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or
    appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the
    hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire
    about the individual’s ability to pay. Penalties for
    violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and
    exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In
    addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or
    a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct
    result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a
    civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
    which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s
    emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
    treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
    hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
    or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
    certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to
    individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government also
    has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA
    violations actively in the future. We believe our hospitals
    operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.



Corporate
    Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting
    corporations and other entities from employing physicians,
    practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and
    indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health
    care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of
    patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for
    medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation
    of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and
    criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the
    corporation and the physician may be considered void and
    unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are
    often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or
    regulatory agencies.

Health
    Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
    years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention,
    changes in government personnel or other factors may lead to
    increased scrutiny of the health care industry. While we are
    currently not aware of any material investigations of the
    Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations,
    it is possible that governmental entities could initiate
    investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we
    operate and that such matters could result in significant
    penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible
    that our executives and managers could be included in
    governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants
    in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental
    billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We
    continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have
    developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is
    designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and
    constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation
    may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or
    industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations,
    governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
    issues, including some for which little official interpretation
    previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent
    with practices that have been common within the industry and
    that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some
    instances, government investigations that have in the past been
    conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be
    conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their
    focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement
    efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of
    Justice have, from time to time, established national
    enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers, that
    focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of
    abuse. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such
    as the Medicare Administrative Contractors, fiscal
    intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health
    care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
    audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and
    state investigations relate to a wide variety of routine health
    care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices,
    including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with
    referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician
    joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices
    for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health
    care operations and other activities that could be the subject
    of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we
    have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous
    financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources
    to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving
    physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have
    received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries
    from federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations
    of the Company, our executives or managers could result in
    significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse
    publicity.

Commencing in 1997, we became aware we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. As part of the investigations, the United
    States intervened in a number of

qui tam

actions brought
    by private parties. The investigations related to, among other
    things, DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing, home health
    issues, physician relations, cost report and wound care issues.
    The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements
    executed in 2000 and 2003 with the Criminal Division of the
    Department of Justice, the Civil Division of the Department of
    Justice, various U.S. Attorneys’ offices, CMS, a



negotiating team representing states with claims against us, and
    others. In January 2001, we entered into an eight year Corporate
    Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
    Services, which expired January 24, 2009. Violation or
    breach of the CIA or other violation of federal or state laws
    relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, could
    subject us to substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal
    penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs and other federal and state health care programs.
    Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or through
    private qui tam actions. Sanctions imposed against us as a
    result of such actions could have a material, adverse effect on
    our results of operations and financial position.

Health
    Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in the United
    States and continues to attract much legislative interest and
    public attention. In recent years, various legislative proposals
    regarding health care reform have been introduced or proposed in
    Congress. We anticipate that national health care reform will be
    a focus at the federal level in the near term. Several states
    are also considering health care reform measures. This focus on
    health care reform may increase the likelihood of significant
    changes affecting the health care industry. Possible future
    changes in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs,
    including Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to upper
    payment limit programs, may impact reimbursements to health care
    providers and insurers. In addition, many states have enacted,
    or are considering enacting, measures designed to reduce their
    Medicaid expenditures and change private health care insurance.
    States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation
    designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll
    Medicaid recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    states’ Medicaid systems. Some states, including the states
    in which we operate, have applied for and have been granted
    federal waivers from current Medicaid regulations to allow them
    to serve some or all of their Medicaid participants through
    managed care providers. Hospital operating margins have been,
    and may continue to be, under significant pressure because of
    deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and growth
    in operating expenses in excess of the increase in PPS payments
    under the Medicare program.

General
    Economic and Demographic Factors

Recently, the United States economy has weakened
    significantly. Tightening credit markets, depressed consumer
    spending and higher unemployment rates continue to pressure many
    industries. During economic downturns, governmental entities
    often experience budgetary constraints as a result of increased
    costs and lower than expected tax collections. These budgetary
    constraints may result in decreased spending for health and
    human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar
    programs, which represent significant payer sources for our
    hospitals. Other risks we face from general economic weakness
    include potential declines in the population covered under
    managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel
    elective and non-emergent health care procedures, potential
    increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and
    further difficulties in our collecting patient copayment and
    deductible receivables.

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United
    States financial pressures. The federal deficit, the
    growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the
    United States population will continue to place pressure on
    federal health care programs.

Compliance
    Program and Corporate Integrity Agreement

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
    is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
    awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
    emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
    regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we
    provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees
    and encourage all employees to report any violations to their
    supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
    telephone ethics line.

Until January 24, 2009, we operated under a CIA, which was
    structured to assure the federal government of our overall
    federal health care program compliance and specifically covered
    DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and physician relations. We
    underwent major training efforts to ensure that our employees
    learned and applied the



policies and procedures implemented under the CIA and our ethics
    and compliance program. The CIA had the effect of increasing the
    amount of information we provided to the federal government
    regarding our health care practices and our compliance with
    federal regulations. Under the CIA, we had numerous affirmative
    obligations, including the requirement to report potential
    violations of applicable federal health care laws and
    regulations. Pursuant to this obligation, we reported a number
    of potential violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-kickback
    Statute, EMTALA, HIPAA and other laws, most of which we consider
    to be nonviolations or technical violations. We will submit our
    final report pursuant to the CIA by April 30, 2009. These
    reports could result in greater scrutiny by regulatory
    authorities. The government could determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues was inadequate. A determination
    that we breached the CIA

and/or

a
    finding of violations of applicable health care laws or
    regulations could subject us to repayment requirements,
    substantial monetary penalties, civil penalties, exclusion from
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties. Though the CIA expired on
    January 24, 2009, we maintain our ethics and compliance
    program in substantially the same form. However, the audit plans
    in the CIA have been modified and the reportable events process
    will be converted to an internal reporting process.

Antitrust
    Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
    laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
    anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
    refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
    tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
    practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
    competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can
    result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
    penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
    currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe
    we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but
    future review of our practices by courts or regulatory
    authorities could result in a determination that could adversely
    affect our operations.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
    ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment. Management does not believe that we will be
    required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with
    these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially
    affect our capital expenditures, results of operations or
    financial condition.

Insurance

As typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims
    and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
    business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has
    obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally
    above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We
    also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
    our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for
    directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts
    that we believe are adequate. The directors and officers
    liability coverage includes a $25 million corporate
    deductible for the periods prior to the Merger and a
    $1 million corporate deductible subsequent to the Merger.
    In addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our
    directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property
    coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of
    the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per
    claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood
    and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees
    and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2008 we had approximately
    191,000 employees, including approximately
    51,000 part-time employees. References herein to
    “employees” refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.
    We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate
    wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating
    to employment. Employees at 21 of our hospitals were represented
    by various labor unions at December 31, 2008 and 2007. We



consider our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our
    hospitals, as well as others, have experienced some recent union
    organizational activity. We had elections at two hospitals in
    California and one in Missouri during 2007 and no elections
    during 2008. We expect to have one election in Missouri in 2009
    as hospital employees have filed a decertification petition with
    the National Labor Relations Board. We do not expect such
    efforts to materially affect our future operations. Our
    hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced labor costs
    rising faster than the general inflation rate. In some markets,
    nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a
    significant operating issue to health care providers. To address
    this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to
    improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and
    productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, who generally
    are not employees of our hospitals. However, some physicians
    provide services in our hospitals under contracts which
    generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the
    duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
    maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation
    for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be
    accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the
    hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
    board of the hospital, in accordance with established
    credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff.
    Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve
    on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their
    affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to
    recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or
    to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. We also
    depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled
    employees in each of the markets in which we operate. As the
    competition increases to hire more people from labor pools that
    are not growing at a rate sufficient to meet demand, our labor
    costs could increase. Certain proposed changes in federal labor
    laws, including the Employee Free Choice Act, may increase the
    likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent that
    a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs
    could increase materially. In addition, union-mandated or
    state-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect
    labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are
    unable to meet the required ratios and are required to limit
    patient admissions as a result. The states in which we operate
    could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce
    mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Risk
    Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors
    were to occur, our business, financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
    adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also
    constrain our business and operations.

Our Substantial Leverage Could Adversely Affect Our Ability
    To Raise Additional Capital To Fund Our Operations, Limit
    Our Ability To React To Changes In The Economy Or Our Industry,
    Expose Us To Interest Rate Risk To The Extent Of Our Variable
    Rate Debt And Prevent Us From Meeting Our Obligations.

Since completing the Recapitalization, we are highly leveraged.
    As of December 31, 2008, our total indebtedness was
    $26.989 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have
    important consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in
    general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse
    changes in government regulations;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing
    us to make nonstrategic divestitures;



•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product or service line
    development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general
    corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who are less highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions
    contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the
    indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness
    is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we
    now face could intensify.

We May
    Not Be Able To Generate Sufficient Cash To Service All Of Our
    Indebtedness And May Not Be Able To Refinance Our Indebtedness
    On Favorable Terms. If We Are Unable To Do So, We May Be Forced
    To Take Other Actions To Satisfy Our Obligations Under Our
    Indebtedness, Which May Not Be Successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
    operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic
    and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business
    and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that
    we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
    sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
    and interest on our indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2008, our substantial indebtedness
    included $14.052 billion of indebtedness under our senior
    secured credit facilities that matures in 2012 and 2013,
    $5.700 billion of second lien notes maturing in 2014 and
    2016 and $6.831 billion of unsecured senior notes and
    debentures that mature on various dates from 2009 to 2095
    (including $5.442 billion maturing through 2016). Because a
    significant portion of our indebtedness matures in the next few
    years, we may find it necessary or prudent to refinance that
    indebtedness with longer-maturity debt at a higher interest
    rate. In February 2009, for example, we issued $310 million
    of


/


% Senior
    Secured Notes due in 2017. We used the net proceeds of that
    offering to prepay term loans under our senior secured credit
    facilities, which currently bear interest at a lower floating
    rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable
    terms, or at all, is directly affected by the current global
    economic and financial crisis. In addition, our ability to incur
    secured indebtedness (which may enable us to achieve better
    pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends
    in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on
    the strength of our cash flows and results of operations and on
    economic and market conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our
    indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments
    and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional
    capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and
    available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service
    obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
    might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to
    meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able
    to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the
    dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service
    obligations then due.

Our Debt
    Agreements Contain Restrictions That Limit Our Flexibility In
    Operating Our Business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
    governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that
    limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.
    These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’
    ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;



•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for
    as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based
    revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving
    credit facility is less than a specified amount, for a certain
    period of time, or if a payment or bankruptcy event of default
    has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our
    depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a
    blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to
    prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and
    to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities we are required to
    satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to
    meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our
    control, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could
    result in a default under both of our senior secured credit
    facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our
    senior secured credit facilities, our lenders could elect to
    declare all amounts outstanding under our senior secured credit
    facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all
    commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay
    those amounts, the lenders under our senior secured credit
    facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them
    to secure each such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant
    portion of our assets as collateral under our senior secured
    credit facilities and our existing senior secured notes. If any
    of the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities
    accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no
    assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our
    senior secured credit facilities and our outstanding notes.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other Hospitals And
    Health Care Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition
    among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
    intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
    local communities served by most of our hospitals provide
    services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In addition,
    CMS publicizes on a website performance data related to quality
    measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals
    submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal
    law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality
    measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and
    future trends toward clinical transparency may have an
    unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient
    volumes. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or
    results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality
    measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, patient volumes
    could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals,
    surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the
    geographic areas in which we operate has increased
    significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
    highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that
    compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or
    not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable
    contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on
    a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals are facing increasing
    competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals and from
    both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for
    market share in high margin services and for quality physicians
    and personnel. If ambulatory surgery centers are better able to
    compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals
    may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may
    experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our
    ambulatory surgery centers. In states that do not require prior
    regulatory approval, known as a certificate of need
    (“CON”), for the purchase, construction or expansion
    of health care facilities or services, competing health care
    providers face low barriers to entry and expansion. Further, if
    our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit
    physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care
    contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ambulatory
    surgery centers, we may experience an overall decline in patient
    volume. See Item 1, “Business —
    Competition.”



The
    Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A Deterioration
    In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could Adversely Affect
    Our Results Of Operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate
    to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which
    the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by
    the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly
    from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal and state governmental and private employer
    health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient
    admissions and other collection indicators. Due to a number of
    factors, including the recent economic downturn and increase in
    unemployment, we believe that our facilities may experience
    growth in bad debts and charity care. At December 31, 2008,
    our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately
    93% of the $5.838 billion patient due accounts receivable
    balance. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
    provision for doubtful accounts increased to 12.0% of revenues
    compared to 11.7% of revenues in 2007.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
    proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
    accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these
    accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Changes
    In Governmental And Judicial Interpretations May Negatively
    Impact Our Ability To Obtain Reimbursement Of Medicare Bad
    Debts

The Medicare program reimburses 70% of bad debts related to
    deductibles and coinsurance for patients with Medicare coverage,
    after the provider has made a reasonable effort to collect those
    amounts. We utilize extensive in-house and external collection
    efforts for our accounts receivable, including deductible and
    coinsurance amounts owed by patients with Medicare coverage. We
    use a secondary collection agency after in-house and primary
    collection agency efforts have been unsuccessful. A recent court
    case upheld CMS’s interpretation that reasonable collection
    efforts have not been satisfied as long as the Medicare accounts
    remain with an external collection agency. We incur substantial
    amounts of Medicare bad debts every year that could be subject
    to this decision. During 2007, we modified our accounts
    receivable collection processes to provide reasonable collection
    results and comply with CMS’s interpretation of reasonable
    collection efforts. Possible future changes in judicial and
    administrative interpretations of law and regulations governing
    Medicare could disrupt our collections processes, increase our
    costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

Changes
    In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from
    government health care programs, principally Medicare and
    Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and
    substantial changes. We derived approximately 59% of our
    admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2008. In
    recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted
    in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of
    payments to health care providers for certain services under
    these government programs. National health care reform is a
    focus at the federal level, and we anticipate that it will
    remain a focus in the near term. Several states are also
    considering health care reform measures. This focus on health
    care reform may increase the likelihood of significant changes
    affecting government health care programs. Possible future
    changes in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other state programs, may
    reduce reimbursements to health care providers and insurers and
    may also increase our operating costs, which could reduce our
    profitability.

CMS issued final regulations effective January 1, 2008 that
    increased ASC payment groups from nine clinically disparate
    payment groups to an extensive list of covered surgical
    procedures among the APCs used under the outpatient PPS for
    these surgical services. CMS estimates that the payment rates
    for procedures performed in an ASC setting equal 65% of the
    corresponding rates paid for the same procedures performed in an
    outpatient hospital setting. The final regulation establishes a
    four-year transition period for implementing the revised payment
    rates. This regulation significantly expands the number of
    procedures that Medicare reimburses if performed in an ASC and
    limits ASC reimbursement for procedures commonly performed in
    physicians’ offices. More Medicare



procedures that are now performed in hospitals, such as ours,
    may be moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals.
    Also, more Medicare procedures that are now performed in ASCs,
    such as ours, may be moved to physicians’ offices.
    Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies.

On August 22, 2007, CMS issued a final rule for federal
    fiscal year 2008 for hospital inpatient PPS. This rule adopts a
    two-year implementation of MS-DRGs, a Medicare severity-adjusted
    diagnosis related group system. This change represents a
    refinement to the existing Medicare DRG system. Realignments in
    the DRG system could impact the margins we receive for certain
    services. For federal fiscal year 2009, CMS has provided a 3.6%
    market basket update for hospitals that submit certain quality
    patient care indicators and a 1.6% update for hospitals that do
    not submit this data. While we will endeavor to comply with all
    quality data submission requirements, our submissions may not be
    deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market
    basket adjustment for all of our hospitals. Medicare payments to
    hospitals in fiscal years 2009 and 2008 have been reduced to
    eliminate what CMS estimates will be the effect of coding or
    classifications changes as a result of hospitals implementing
    the MS-DRG system. CMS may retrospectively determine if the
    adjustment levels for federal fiscal years 2009 and 2008 were
    adequate and may impose an adjustment in future years if CMS
    finds that the adjustment was inadequate. Additionally, Medicare
    payments to hospitals are subject to a number of other
    adjustments, and the actual impact on payments to specific
    hospitals may vary. In some cases, commercial third-party payers
    and other payers such as some state Medicaid programs rely on
    all or portions of the Medicare DRG system to determine payment
    rates. The change from traditional Medicare DRGs to MS-DRGs
    could adversely impact those payment rates if any other payers
    adopt MS-DRGs.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current
    economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most
    states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely
    will continue to result in decreased spending for Medicaid
    programs in many states. Further, many states have also adopted,
    or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage and
    program eligibility, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care
    programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems.

Recently, the Department of Defense implemented a prospective
    payment system for hospital outpatient services furnished to
    TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for services
    furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the Medicare
    outpatient prospective payment system APC rates have
    historically been below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this
    payment methodology for TRICARE beneficiaries will reduce our
    reimbursement. This change in TRICARE will have a material
    impact on our revenues from this program; however, TRICARE
    outpatient services do not represent a significant portion of
    our patient volumes. The TRICARE outpatient payment rule has
    been reopened for comment and the effective date delayed until
    May 1, 2009. Further modification to the new outpatient
    payment system may be made.

Changes in laws or regulations regarding government health
    programs or other changes in the administration of government
    health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

If We Are
    Unable To Retain And Negotiate Favorable Contracts With
    Nongovernment Payers, Including Managed Care Plans, Our Revenues
    May Be Reduced.

Our ability to obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment
    payers, including health maintenance organizations, preferred
    provider organizations and other managed care plans
    significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our
    facilities. Revenues derived from these entities and other
    insurers accounted for 53% and 54% of our patient revenues for
    the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, continue to
    demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward
    consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their
    bargaining power over fee structures. Our future success will
    depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our managed
    care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on
    terms favorable to us. Other health care providers may impact
    our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate
    increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and
    conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate
    exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise
    restrict the ability of



managed care companies to contract with us. If we are unable to
    retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans
    or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts
    received from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our
    Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain Quality
    Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions,
    and the success of our hospitals depends, therefore, in part on
    the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs
    of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians
    and maintaining good relations with those physicians. Physicians
    are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice
    and, in many of the markets that we serve, most physicians have
    admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our
    hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with
    our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate
    support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and
    hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians,
    they may be discouraged from referring patients to our
    facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating
    performance may decline.

Our
    Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May Increase
    Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and
    experience of our management and medical support personnel, such
    as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our
    physicians. We compete with other health care providers in
    recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
    personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
    hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
    professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
    other medical support personnel has become a significant
    operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to
    continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain
    nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more
    expensive temporary or contract personnel. We also depend on the
    available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in
    each of the markets in which we operate. As the competition
    increases to hire more people from labor pools that are not
    growing at a rate sufficient to meet demand, our labor costs
    could increase. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws,
    including the Employee Free Choice Act, may increase the
    likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent that
    a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs
    could increase materially. In addition, union-mandated or
    state-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect
    labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenue if we are
    unable to meet the required ratios and are required to limit
    admissions as a result. If our labor costs increase, we may not
    be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because
    a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed,
    prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor
    costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain
    qualified management, nurses and other medical support
    personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

If We
    Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government Regulations,
    We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make Significant
    Changes To Our Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
    and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local
    government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing for services;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•

adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance and security issues associated with
    health-related information and medical records;

•

the screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who
    have emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and certification;



•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

operating policies and procedures; and

•

addition of facilities and services.

Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the
    federal physician self-referral law (commonly called the Stark
    Law) and the federal FCA and similar state laws. We have a
    variety of financial relationships with physicians and others
    who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our
    hospitals and other health care facilities, and these laws
    govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor
    regulations that outline practices that are deemed protected
    from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we
    endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of
    our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial
    relationships with physicians and other referral sources and
    persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify
    for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor
    does not mean that the arrangement necessarily violates the
    Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater
    scrutiny; however, we cannot offer assurance that practices
    outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the
    Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the
    Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof
    than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback
    Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their
    immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by
    meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships
    to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
    implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we
    cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the
    Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an
    exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the
    Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark
    Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found
    to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the
    government or by a private person under a

qui tam

,
    or “whistleblower,” suit.

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
    Law, the FCA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could
    be subjected to liabilities, including civil penalties
    (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more
    facilities), exclusion of one or more facilities from
    participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties. See “Regulation.”

CMS is proceeding with a proposal to collect information from
    400 hospitals regarding their ownership, investment and
    compensation arrangements with physicians. Called the Disclosure
    of Financial Relationships Report or “DFRR,” CMS
    intends to use this data to monitor compliance with the Stark
    Law, and CMS may share this information with other government
    agencies. Many of these agencies have not previously analyzed
    this information and have the authority to bring enforcement
    actions against hospitals filing such reports.

Because many of these laws and their implementing regulations
    are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of
    significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
    and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
    enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our
    current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
    illegality or could require us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure
    programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have
    violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are
    being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could
    have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business
    reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other
    legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be
    adopted that adversely affect our business.

We
    Have Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations, Claims And
    Litigation, And We Could Be The Subject Of Additional
    Investigations In The Future.

Commencing in 1997, we became aware that we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
    series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
    we entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG, which expired
    January 24, 2009.



Under the CIA, we had numerous affirmative obligations,
    including the requirement to report potential violations of
    applicable federal health care laws and regulations. Pursuant to
    these obligations, we reported a number of potential violations
    of the Stark Law, the Anti-kickback Statute, the EMTALA and
    other laws, most of which we consider to be nonviolations or
    technical violations. We will submit our final report pursuant
    to the CIA by April 30, 2009. The government could
    determine that our reporting

and/or

our
    resolution of reported issues was inadequate. If we are found to
    have violated the CIA or any applicable health care laws or
    regulations, we could be subject to repayment requirements,
    substantial monetary fines, civil penalties, exclusion from
    participation in the Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs, and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties. Any such sanctions or
    expenses could have a material, adverse effect on our financial
    position, results of operations or liquidity.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal FCA,
    private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit
    false claims for payments to the government. Some states have
    adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.
    Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other
    facilities may receive, government inquiries from federal and
    state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in
    these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered
    systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare
    Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers,
    as well as the OIG, conduct audits of our health care
    operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
    audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.
    Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and
    whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the
    resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect
    on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

The MMA established the RAC three-year demonstration program to
    conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper
    payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. Beginning in
    2005, CMS contracted with three different RACs to conduct these
    reviews in California, Florida and New York. The program was
    expanded in August 2007 to include Arizona, Massachusetts and
    South Carolina. We had 46 hospitals located in the demonstration
    areas and 44 of these hospitals actually had a review performed.
    The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the RAC program
    permanent and mandated its nationwide expansion by 2010. Should
    we be found out of compliance, depending on the nature of the
    findings, our business, our financial position and our results
    of operations could be negatively impacted.

Controls
    Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our
    Revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to
    reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
    “utilization review,” have affected and are expected
    to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails
    the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient
    by health plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay
    and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by
    payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review
    and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
    health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
    Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to
    continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these
    changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the
    scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees
    could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
    position and results of operations.

Our
    Overall Business Results May Suffer From The Recent Economic
    Downturn.

Recently, the United States economy has weakened
    significantly. Tightening credit markets, depressed consumer
    spending and higher unemployment rates continue to pressure many
    industries. During economic downturns, governmental entities
    often experience budgetary constraints as a result of increased
    costs and lower than expected tax collections. These budgetary
    constraints may result in decreased spending for health and
    human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar
    programs, which represent significant payer sources for our
    hospitals. Other risks we face from general economic weakness
    include potential declines in the population



covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to
    postpone or cancel elective and non-emergent healthcare
    procedures, potential increases in the uninsured and
    underinsured populations and further difficulties in our
    collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables.

The
    Industry Trend Towards Value-Based Purchasing May Negatively
    Impact Our Revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based
    purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing
    programs include both public reporting of quality data and
    preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of
    care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including
    Medicare and Medicaid require hospitals to report certain
    quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition
    Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain
    preventable adverse events (also called “never
    events”). Many large commercial payers currently require
    hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers
    do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse
    events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which
    we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or
    expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events. We
    expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that
    condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become
    more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement
    amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend
    will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively
    impact our revenues.

Our
    Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our Information
    Systems.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or
    delay the collection of revenues. Even though we have
    implemented network security measures, our servers are
    vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar
    disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any
    of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss
    or corruption of data, or cessations in the availability of
    systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on
    our financial position and results of operations and harm our
    business reputation.

The performance of our sophisticated information technology and
    systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to
    our shared services initiatives, our information systems are
    essential to a number of critical areas of our operations,
    including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management;

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts
    and supply contracts; and

•

monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality
    measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.

State
    Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of Health Care
    Facilities Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our
    Operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country,
    require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as
    a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health
    care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make
    changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these
    states consider the need for additional or expanded health care
    facilities or services. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. The failure to
    obtain any requested CON could impair our ability to operate or
    expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely
    affect our ability to attract patients to our facilities and
    grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.



Our
    Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas, Which
    Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental And
    Competitive Conditions And Changes In Those States.

We operated 166 hospitals at December 31, 2008, and 72 of
    those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida
    and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented
    approximately 51% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2008. This concentration makes us
    particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental
    and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any
    material change in the current payment programs or regulatory,
    economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those
    states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall
    business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida and Texas and other areas
    across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In
    the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the
    operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal
    states, and the patient populations in those states. Our
    business activities could be harmed by a particularly active
    hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property
    insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from
    future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.

We are currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
    Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) certain claimed
    deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection
    with its examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal income tax
    returns for HCA and 17 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). The disputed items include the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues and our method
    for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts.

Eight taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1995
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year of 13 affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are
    pending before the IRS Examination Division or the United States
    Tax Court as of December 31, 2008. The IRS began an audit
    of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns for HCA and
    seven affiliated partnerships during 2008.

We May Be
    Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against Our
    Facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices,
    including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
    ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
    liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims
    and significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our
    professional liability risks through a wholly-owned subsidiary.
    Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and
    insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims
    arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance
    contracts, and the obligations covered by the reinsurance
    contracts are included in its reserves for professional
    liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable to the extent
    that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the
    reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially
    determined estimates, are not covered by insurance or
    reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results
    of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.

We Are
    Exposed To Market Risks Related To Changes In The Market Values
    Of Securities And Interest Rate Changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.614 billion and $8 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2008, we had a net unrealized loss of
    $48 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash in
    excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
    expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a



timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than
    what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market
    environment. At December 31, 2008, our wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary, had invested $536 million
    ($573 million par value) in municipal, tax-exempt student
    loan auction rate securities which were classified as long-term
    investments. The auction rate securities (“ARS”) are
    publicly issued securities with long-term stated maturities for
    which the interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction every
    seven to 35 days. With the liquidity issues experienced in
    global credit and capital markets, the ARS held by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary have experienced multiple
    failed auctions, beginning on February 11, 2008, as the
    amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of
    purchase orders. There is a very limited market for the ARS at
    this time. We do not currently intend to attempt to sell the ARS
    as the liquidity needs of our insurance subsidiary are expected
    to be met by other investments in its investment portfolio. If
    uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or
    there are ratings downgrades on the ARS held by our insurance
    subsidiary, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
    impairments on these long-term investments in future periods.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates and periodically enter into interest rate swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our
    interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
    variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on
    common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The net
    interest payments based on the notional amounts in these
    agreements generally match the timing of the cash flows of the
    related liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
    represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
    and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. See Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Since The
    Recapitalization, The Investors Control Us And May Have
    Conflicts Of Interest With Us In The Future.

As of December 31, 2008, the Investors and certain other
    investors indirectly own 97.3% of our capital stock due to the
    Recapitalization. As a result, the Investors have control over
    our decisions to enter into any significant corporate
    transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that
    requires the approval of shareholders. For example, the
    Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the
    amount of our indebtedness or sell assets.

Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making
    investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
    businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or
    more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities
    that may be complementary to our business and, as a result,
    those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So
    long as investment funds associated with or designated by the
    Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the
    outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is
    less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly
    influence or effectively control our decisions.

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we
    directly or indirectly operate 105 freestanding surgery centers.
    We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with
    some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
    occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Under our
    senior secured cash flow credit facility entered into in
    connection with the Recapitalization, 14 of our general, acute
    care hospitals were mortgaged as collateral.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately
    1,209,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
    area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain
    regional service centers related to our shared services
    initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
    which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
    suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
    for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various
    federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating
    their operation. Management does not believe that compliance
    with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect
    our financial position or results of operations.

Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position in a given period.

Government
    Investigations, Claims and Litigation

In January 2001, we entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG
    which expired on January 24, 2009. Violation or breach of
    the CIA, or violation of federal or state laws relating to
    Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, could subject us to
    substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs. Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or
    through private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed
    against us as a result of such actions could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.



ERISA
    Litigation

On November 22, 2005, Brenda Thurman, a former employee of
    an HCA affiliate, filed a complaint in the United States
    District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of
    herself, the HCA Savings and Retirement Program (the
    “Plan”), and a class of participants in the Plan who
    held an interest in our common stock, against our Chairman and
    Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer,
    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other
    unnamed individuals. The lawsuit, filed under
    sections 502(a)(2) and 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement
    Income Security Act (“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C.
    §§ 1132(a)(2) and (3), alleges that defendants
    breached their fiduciary duties owed to the Plan and to plan
    participants and seeks monetary damages and injunctions and
    other relief.

On January 13, 2006, the court signed an order staying all
    proceedings and discovery in this matter, pending resolution of
    a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in a
    related federal securities class action against HCA. On
    January 18, 2006, the magistrate judge signed an order
    (1) consolidating Thurman’s cause of action with all
    other future actions making the same claims and arising out of
    the same operative facts, (2) appointing Thurman as lead
    plaintiff, and (3) appointing Thurman’s attorneys as
    lead counsel and liaison counsel in the case. We have reached an
    agreement in principle to settle this suit, subject to final
    court approval.

Merger
    Litigation in State Court

On October 23, 2006, the Foundation for Seacoast Health
    (the “Foundation”) filed a lawsuit against us and one
    of our affiliates, HCA Health Services of New Hampshire, Inc.,
    in the Superior Court of Rockingham County, New Hampshire.
    Among other things, the complaint seeks to enforce certain
    provisions of an asset purchase agreement between the parties,
    including a purported right of first refusal to purchase a New
    Hampshire hospital, that allegedly were triggered by the Merger
    and other prior events. The Foundation initially sought to
    enjoin the Merger. However, the parties reached an agreement
    that allowed the Merger to proceed, while preserving the
    plaintiff’s opportunity to litigate whether the Merger
    triggered the right of first refusal to purchase the hospital
    and, if so, at what price the hospital could be repurchased. On
    May 25, 2007, the court granted HCA’s motion for
    summary judgment disposing of the Foundation’s central
    claims. The Foundation filed an appeal from the final judgment.
    On July 15, 2008, the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that
    the Merger did not trigger the right of first refusal. The Court
    remanded to the lower court the claim that the right of first
    refusal had been triggered by certain intra-corporate
    transactions in 1999. The Court did not determine the merits of
    that claim, and we will continue to defend the claim vigorously.

General
    Liability and Other Claims

On April 10, 2006, a class action complaint was filed
    against us in the District Court of Kansas alleging, among other
    matters, nurse understaffing at all of our hospitals, certain
    consumer protection act violations, negligence and unjust
    enrichment. The complaint is seeking, among other relief,
    declaratory relief and monetary damages, including disgorgement
    of profits of $12.250 billion. A motion to dismiss this
    action was granted on July 27, 2006, but the plaintiffs
    appealed this dismissal. While the appeal was pending, the
    Kansas Supreme Court for the first time construed the Kansas
    Consumer Protection Act to apply to the provision of medical
    services. Based on that new ruling, the 10th Circuit
    reversed the district court’s dismissal and remanded the
    action for further consideration by the trial court. We will
    continue to defend this claim vigorously.

We are a party to certain proceedings relating to claims for
    income taxes and related interest in the United States Tax
    Court. For a description of those proceedings, see Item 7,
    “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Pending IRS
    Disputes” and Note 6 to our consolidated financial
    statements.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
    physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
    the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which
    may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management,
    the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
    proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

Item 4.

Submission
    of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
    the fourth quarter of 2008.



PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our outstanding common stock is privately held, and there is no
    established public trading market for our common stock. As of
    February 25, 2009, there were 631 holders of our common
    stock. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Financing Activities” for a
    description of the restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.
    We did not pay any dividends in 2007 or 2008.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, HCA issued
    431,216 shares of common stock in connection with the
    cashless exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration
    of $5,498,004 resulting in 217,732 net settled shares. The
    shares were issued without registration in reliance on the
    exemptions afforded by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
    of 1933, as amended, and Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.

On April 29, 2008, we registered our common stock pursuant
    to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended.

The following table provides certain information with respect to
    our repurchase of common stock from October 1, 2008 through

    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

    Operations Summary (Continued)

Revenues increased 5.6% on a consolidated basis and 7.0% on a
    same facility basis for the year ended December 31, 2008
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The
    consolidated revenues increase can be attributed to the combined
    impact of a 5.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission
    and a 0.5% increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility
    revenues increase resulted from a 5.1% increase in same facility
    revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9% increase in same
    facility equivalent admissions.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, consolidated
    admissions declined 0.7% and same facility admissions increased
    0.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.
    Inpatient surgical volumes declined 4.5% on a consolidated basis
    and declined 0.5% on a same facility basis during the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Outpatient surgical volumes declined
    0.9% on a consolidated basis and declined 0.2% on a same
    facility basis during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, the provision for
    doubtful accounts increased to 12.0% of revenues from 11.7% of
    revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Same
    facility uninsured admissions increased 1.7% and same facility
    uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007.

Interest expense totaled $2.021 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to $2.215 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. The $194 million
    decrease in interest expense for 2008 was due to reductions in
    both the average debt balance and average interest rate during
    2008.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
    quality, cost-effective health care while complying fully with
    our ethics policy, governmental regulations and guidelines and
    industry standards. As a part of this strategy, management
    focuses on the following principal elements:

Maintain Our Dedication to the Care and Improvement of Human
    Life.

Our business is built on putting patients
    first and providing high quality health care services in the
    communities we serve. Our dedicated professionals oversee our
    Quality Review System, which measures clinical outcomes,
    satisfaction and regulatory compliance to improve hospital
    quality and performance. We are implementing hospitalist
    programs in some facilities, evidence-based medicine programs
    and infection reduction initiatives. In addition, we continue to
    implement advanced health information technology to improve the
    quality and convenience of services to our communities. We are
    using our advanced electronic medication administration record,
    which uses bar coding technology to ensure that each patient
    receives the right medication, to build toward a fully
    electronic health record that will provide convenient access,
    electronic order entry and decision support for physicians.
    These technologies improve patient safety, quality and
    efficiency.

Maintain Our Commitment to Ethics and
    Compliance.

We are committed to a corporate
    culture highlighted by the following values —
    compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness, loyalty, respect and
    kindness. Our comprehensive ethics and compliance program
    reinforces our dedication to these values.

Leverage Our Leading Local Market
    Positions.

We strive to maintain and enhance the
    leading positions that we enjoy in the majority of our markets.
    We believe that the broad geographic presence of our facilities
    across a range of markets, in combination with the breadth and
    quality of services provided by our facilities, increases our
    attractiveness to patients and large employers and positions us
    to negotiate more favorable terms from commercial payers and
    increase the number of payers with whom we contract. We also
    intend to strategically enhance our outpatient presence in our
    communities to attract more patients to our facilities.

    INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Business
    Strategy (Continued)

Expand Our Presence in Key Markets.

We seek to
    grow our business in key markets, focusing on large, high growth
    urban and suburban communities, primarily in the southern and
    western regions of the United States. We seek to strategically
    invest in new and expanded services at our existing hospitals
    and surgery centers to increase our revenues at those facilities
    and provide the benefits of medical technology advances to our
    communities. We intend to continue to expand high volume and
    high margin specialty services, such as cardiology and
    orthopedic services, and increase the capacity, scope and
    convenience of our outpatient facilities. To complement this
    intrinsic growth, we intend to continue to opportunistically
    develop and acquire new hospitals and outpatient facilities.

Continue to Leverage Our Scale.

We will
    continue to obtain price efficiencies through our group
    purchasing organization and build on the cost savings and
    efficiencies in billing, collection and other processes we have
    achieved through our regional service centers. We are
    increasingly taking advantage of our national scale by
    contracting for services on a multistate basis. We will expand
    our successful shared services model for additional clinical and
    support functions, such as physician credentialing, medical
    transcription and electronic medical recordkeeping, across
    multiple markets.

Continue to Develop Enduring Physician
    Relationships.

We depend on the quality and
    dedication of the physicians who serve at our facilities, and we
    recruit both primary care physicians and specialists to meet
    community needs. We often assist recruited physicians with
    establishing and building a practice or joining an existing
    practice in compliance with regulatory standards. We intend to
    improve both service levels and revenues in our markets by:

•

expanding the number of high quality specialty services, such as
    cardiology, orthopedics, oncology and neonatology;

•

continuing to use joint ventures with physicians to further
    develop our outpatient business, particularly through ambulatory
    surgery centers and outpatient diagnostic centers;

•

developing medical office buildings to provide convenient
    facilities for physicians to locate their practices and serve
    their patients; and

•

continuing our focus on improving hospital quality and
    performance and implementing advanced technologies in our
    facilities to attract physicians to our facilities.

Become the Health Care Employer of Choice.

We
    will continue to use a number of industry-leading practices to
    help ensure our hospitals are a health care employer of choice
    in their respective communities. Our staffing initiatives for
    both care providers and hospital management provide strategies
    for recruitment, compensation and productivity to increase
    employee retention and operating efficiency at our hospitals.
    For example, we maintain an internal contract nursing agency to
    supply our hospitals with high quality staffing at a lower cost
    than external agencies. In addition, we have developed several
    proprietary training and career development programs for our
    physicians and hospital administrators, including an executive
    development program designed to train the next generation of
    hospital leadership. We believe our continued investment in the
    training and retention of employees improves the quality of
    care, enhances operational efficiency and fosters employee
    loyalty.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and various other assumptions we believe are
    reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on
    an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related
    disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes
    known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.



HCA
    INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND
    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
    are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
    Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
    plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
    contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to
    interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on
    a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best
    information available regarding management’s interpretation
    of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.
    Management continually reviews the contractual estimation
    process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and
    regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual
    terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We
    have invested significant resources to refine and improve our
    computerized billing systems and the information system data
    used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed
    standardized calculation processes and related training programs
    to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals
    for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the
    federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
    federal poverty level is established by the federal government
    and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts
    from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify
    for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
    those provided to many local managed care plans.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and
    documentation of health care services authorized and provided,
    the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement
    are often subject to interpretations that could result in
    payments that are different from our estimates. A hypothetical
    1% change in net receivables that are subject to contractual
    discounts at December 31, 2008 would result in an impact on
    pretax earnings of approximately $34 million.

Provision
    for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
    care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
    primary source of cash and is critical to our operating
    performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured
    patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the
    primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
    applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all
    uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts.
    Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and
    external collection efforts have been performed. Prior to 2007,
    we considered the return of an account from the

primary external collection agency to be the culmination of our
    reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing
    off the account balance. During 2007, we modified our collection
    policies to establish a review of all accounts against certain
    standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal
    collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive
    collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary external
    collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The
    accounts that are not collected by the secondary external
    collection agency are written off when they are returned to us
    by the collection agency (usually within 18 months). Our
    collection policy change results in a delay in writing off the
    accounts forwarded to the secondary external collection agency
    compared to our previous policy, and during 2007 and 2008, we
    incurred increases in both our gross accounts receivable and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts due to this delay in recording
    writeoffs. Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and
    the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the
    patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of
    amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify
    as charity care. Charity care is not reported in revenues and
    does not have an impact on the provision for doubtful accounts.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
    coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on
    the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and
    recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
    revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
    analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating
    the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
    hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
    accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At
    December 31, 2008, the allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 93% of the $5.838 billion patient
    due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of the
    related estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid assistance or charity was being
    evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). At
    December 31, 2007, the allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 89% of the $4.825 billion patient
    due accounts receivable balance, including pending Medicaid
    accounts, net of the related estimated contractual discounts.
    Days revenues in accounts receivable were 49 days,
    53 days and 53 days at December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the
    challenges related to the collection of the patient due
    accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients
    having adequate health care coverage, general economic
    conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer
    mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health
    care coverage could affect the collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Professional
    Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in
    an environment with professional liability risks. Since
    January 1, 2007, our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence, subject to a $5 million
    per occurrence self-insured retention. Prior to 2007, our
    facilities’ coverage with our insurance subsidiary was not
    subject to the $5 million self-insured retention and a
    substantial portion of our professional liability risks was
    insured through our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves
    for professional liability risks were $1.387 billion and
    $1.513 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The current portion of these reserves,
    $279 million and $280 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in “other accrued
    expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are
    included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as
    the insurance subsidiary remains liable to the extent reinsurers
    do not meet their obligations. Reserves for professional
    liability risks (net of $57 million and $44 million
    receivable under reinsurance contracts at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively) were $1.330 billion and
    $1.469 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Reserves and provisions for professional liability
    risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates. The
    estimated reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under
    reinsurance contracts, were $1.102 billion to
    $1.332 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    $1.224 billion to $1.471 billion at December 31,
    2007. Reserves for professional liability risks represent the
    estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses
    incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet
    dates. The reserves are estimated using individual case-basis
    valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject
    to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The
    estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded
    as experience develops or new information becomes known. Changes
    to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current
    operating results. Provisions for losses related to professional
    liability risks were $175 million, $163 million and
    $217 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,800 and 2,600 individual claims at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. The estimation of the
    timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Due to
    the considerable variability that is

inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that the
    ultimate liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary
    differences that arise from the recognition of items in
    different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax
    assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed
    in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed
    in future periods.

Although we believe that we have properly reported taxable
    income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws,
    federal, state or international taxing authorities may challenge
    our tax positions upon audit. We account for uncertain tax
    positions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”
    Accordingly, we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits
    from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
    our income tax return. Final audit results may vary from our
    estimates.

Revenue/Volume
    Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
    and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
    and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services.
    Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are
    actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with
    third-party payers, including government programs and managed
    care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based
    upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per
    diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges.
    We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured
    patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care that
    are similar to the discounts provided to many local managed care
    plans.

Revenues increased 5.6% to $28.374 billion for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from $26.858 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 and increased 5.4% for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 from $25.477 billion for
    the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in revenues
    in 2008 can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a
    5.2% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 0.5%
    increase in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.
    The increase in revenues in 2007 can be primarily attributed to
    an 8.3% increase in revenue per equivalent admission, offsetting
    a 2.7% decline in equivalent admissions compared to 2006.

Admissions declined 0.7% in 2008 compared to 2007 and declined
    3.6% in 2007 compared to 2006. Inpatient surgeries declined 4.5%
    and outpatient surgeries declined 0.9% during 2008 compared to
    2007. Inpatient surgeries declined 3.1% and outpatient surgeries
    declined 2.0% during 2007 compared to 2006. Emergency room
    visits increased 2.5% during 2008 compared to 2007 and declined
    1.9% during 2007 compared to 2006.

Same facility revenues increased 7.0% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and increased 7.4% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The 7.0% increase for 2008 can be
    primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 5.1% increase
    in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 7.4%
    increase for 2007 can be primarily attributed to an 8.1%
    increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission,
    offsetting a 0.7% decline in equivalent admissions.

Same facility admissions increased 0.9% in 2008 compared to 2007
    and declined 1.3% in 2007 compared to 2006. Same facility
    inpatient surgeries declined 0.5% and same facility outpatient

2008 compared to 2007. Same facility inpatient surgeries
    declined 1.0% and same facility outpatient surgeries declined
    1.1% during 2007 compared to 2006. Same facility emergency room
    visits increased 3.6% during 2008 compared to 2007 and increased
    0.7% during 2007 compared to 2006.

Same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased 4.5% and
    same facility uninsured admissions increased 1.7% during 2008
    compared to 2007. Same facility uninsured emergency room visits
    increased 7.3% and same facility uninsured admissions increased
    9.4% during 2007 compared to 2006. Management believes same
    facility uninsured emergency room visits and same facility
    uninsured admissions could continue to increase during 2009 if
    the adverse general economic and unemployment trends continue.

Admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid, managed care and other insurers and the
    uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and

Several factors negatively affected patient volumes in 2008 and
    2007. More stringent enforcement of case management guidelines
    led to certain patient services being classified as outpatient
    observation visits instead of

one-day

admissions. Unit closures and changes in Medicare admission
    guidelines led to reductions in rehabilitation and skilled
    nursing admissions. Cardiac admissions have been affected by
    competition from physician-owned heart hospitals.

Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled
    $7.351 billion and $6.911 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2008 and
    2007, 55% of our admissions and 51% of our revenues were
    generated by our Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured
    admissions in Florida and Texas represented 63% and 62% of our
    uninsured admissions during 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We provided $1.747 billion, $1.530 billion and
    $1.296 billion of charity care (amounts are based upon our
    gross charges) during the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. We provide discounts to uninsured
    patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These
    discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed
    care plans and totaled $1.853 billion, $1.474 billion
    and $1.095 billion for the years ended December 31,
    2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government
    health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are
    highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial
    changes. We have increased the indigent care services we provide
    in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation
    with other hospitals. The state of Texas has been involved in
    the effort to increase the indigent care provided by private
    hospitals. As a result of this additional indigent care provided
    by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in
    Texas have available funds that were previously devoted to
    indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are
    under no contractual or legal obligation to provide such
    indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have
    elected to transfer some portion of these newly available funds
    to the state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole
    discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is
    anticipated that these contributions to the state will be
    matched with federal Medicaid funds. The state then may make
    supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid
    services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental
    payments may include those that are providing additional
    indigent care services. Such payments must be within the federal
    UPL established by federal regulation.

During 2007, based upon a review of certain expenditures claimed
    for federal Medicaid matching funds by the state of Texas, the
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
    deferred a portion of claimed amounts. CMS completed its review
    of the claimed expenditures and released the previously deferred
    amounts during 2008. Our Texas Medicaid revenues included
    $262 million and $232 million during 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, of Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to UPL
    programs. We expect to continue to recognize net benefits
    related to the Texas Medicaid supplemental payment program based
    upon the routine incurrence of indigent care expenditures and
    expected processing of Medicaid supplemental payments.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

Net income totaled $673 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to $874 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007. Financial results for 2008
    include gains on sales of facilities of $97 million and
    asset impairment charges of $64 million. Financial results
    for 2007 include gains on sales of facilities of
    $471 million and an asset impairment charge of
    $24 million.

Revenues increased 5.6% to $28.374 billion for 2008 from
    $26.858 billion for 2007. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to the combined impact of a 5.2% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 0.5% increase in equivalent
    admissions compared to 2007. Same facility revenues increased
    7.0% due primarily to the combined impact of a 5.1% increase in
    same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.9%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to 2007.

During 2008, same facility admissions increased 0.9%, compared
    to 2007. Inpatient surgical volumes declined 4.5% on a
    consolidated basis and same facility inpatient surgeries
    declined 0.5% during 2008 compared to 2007. Outpatient surgical
    volumes declined 0.9% on a consolidated basis and same facility
    outpatient surgeries declined 0.2% during 2008 compared to 2007.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.3%
    in 2008 and 39.9% in 2007. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 6.3% in 2008 compared to 2007. Same facility
    labor rate increases averaged 5.1% for 2008 compared to 2007.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.3% in 2008 and
    16.4% in 2007. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    4.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Same facility supply costs
    increased 8.0% for medical devices, 2.8% for pharmacy supplies,
    18.7% for blood products and 6.6% for general medical and
    surgical items in 2008 compared to 2007.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased
    to 16.1% in 2008 from 15.7% in 2007. Other operating expenses
    are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome
    taxes. Increases in professional fees paid to hospitalists,
    emergency room physicians and anesthesiologists represented
    20 basis points of the 2008 increase in other operating
    expenses. Other operating expenses include $143 million and
    $187 million of indigent care costs in certain Texas
    markets during 2008 and 2007, respectively. Provisions for
    losses related to professional liability risks were
    $175 million and $163 million for 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of revenues,
    increased to 12.0% for 2008 from 11.7% in 2007. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from
    patients. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts,
    as a percentage of revenues, can be attributed to an increasing
    amount of patient financial responsibility under certain managed
    care plans and same facility increases in uninsured emergency
    room visits of 4.5% and uninsured admissions of 1.7% in 2008
    compared to 2007. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for
    doubtful accounts represented approximately 93% of the $5.838
    billion total patient due accounts receivable balance, including
    accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to
    patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being
    evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $206 million for 2007 to $223 million for 2008. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

No net gains on investments were recognized during 2008 and net
    gains on investments for 2007 of $8 million relate to sales
    of investment securities by our wholly-owned insurance
    subsidiary. Net unrealized losses on investment securities were
    $48 million at December 31, 2008, representing a
    $69 million decline from a net unrealized gain position of
    $21 million at December 31, 2007.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (Continued)

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenue, to 5.0% in 2008 from 5.4% in 2007. Depreciation expense
    was $1.412 billion for 2008 and $1.421 billion for
    2007.

Interest expense decreased to $2.021 billion for 2008 from
    $2.215 billion for 2007. The decrease in interest expense
    was due to reductions in both the average debt balance and the
    average effective interest rate on long-term debt. Our average
    debt balance was $27.211 billion for 2008 compared to
    $27.732 billion for 2007. The average interest rate for our
    long-term debt decreased from 7.6% at December 31, 2007 to
    6.9% at December 31, 2008.

Gains on sales of facilities were $97 million for 2008 and
    included $81 million of net gains on the sales of two
    hospital facilities and $16 million of net gains on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments. Gains
    on sales of facilities were $471 million for 2007 and
    included a $312 million gain on the sale of our two
    Switzerland hospitals, a $131 million gain on the sale of a
    facility in Florida and $28 million of net gains on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
    increased from $208 million for 2007 to $229 million
    for 2008. The increase relates primarily to our Austin, Texas
    market partnership and our group purchasing organization.

The effective tax rate was 28.5% for 2008 and 26.6% for 2007.
    Primarily as a result of reaching a settlement with the IRS
    Appeals Division and the revision of the amount of a proposed
    IRS adjustment related to prior taxable periods, we reduced our
    provision for income taxes by $69 million in 2008. Our 2007
    provision for income taxes was reduced by $85 million,
    principally based on receiving new information related to tax
    positions taken in a prior taxable year, and by an additional
    $39 million to adjust 2006 state tax accruals to the
    amounts reported on completed tax returns and based upon an
    analysis of the Recapitalization costs. Excluding the effect of
    these adjustments, the effective tax rates for 2008 and 2007
    would have been 35.8% and 37.0%, respectively.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2007 and 2006

Net income totaled $874 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to $1.036 billion for the
    year ended December 31, 2006. Financial results for 2007
    include gains on sales of facilities of $471 million, gains
    on investments of $8 million and an asset impairment charge
    of $24 million. Financial results for 2006 include gains on
    sales of facilities of $205 million, gains on investments
    of $243 million, expenses related to the Recapitalization
    of $442 million and an asset impairment charge of
    $24 million.

Revenues increased 5.4% to $26.858 billion for 2007 from
    $25.477 billion for 2006. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to an 8.3% increase in revenue per equivalent
    admission, offsetting a 2.7% decline in equivalent admissions
    compared to the prior year. Same facility revenues increased
    7.4% due to an 8.1% increase in same facility revenue per
    equivalent admission, offsetting a 0.7% decline in same facility
    equivalent admissions compared to the prior year.

During 2007, same facility admissions declined 1.3% compared to
    2006. Inpatient surgical volumes declined 3.1% on a consolidated
    basis and same facility inpatient surgeries declined 1.0% during
    2007 compared to 2006. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 2.0%
    on a consolidated basis and same facility outpatient surgeries
    declined 1.1% during 2007 compared to 2006.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 39.9%
    in 2007 and 40.9% in 2006. Salaries and benefits per equivalent
    admission increased 5.8% in 2007 compared to 2006. Labor rate
    increases averaged 5.0% for 2007 compared to 2006.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.4% in 2007 and
    17.0% in 2006. Supply costs per equivalent admission increased
    4.5% in 2007 compared to 2006. Same facility supply costs

devices, primarily for orthopedic supplies, 13.1% for blood
    products, and 5.6% for general medical and surgical items.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased
    to 15.7% in 2007 from 16.0% in 2006. Other operating expenses
    are primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees,
    repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance
    (including professional liability insurance) and nonincome
    taxes. Other operating expenses include $187 million and
    $11 million of indigent care costs in certain Texas markets
    during 2007 and 2006, respectively. Provisions for losses
    related to professional liability risks were $163 million
    and $217 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
    reduction in the provision for professional liability risks
    reflects the recognition by our actuaries of improving frequency
    and severity claim trends at our facilities.

Provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of revenues,
    increased to 11.7% for 2007 from 10.4% in 2006. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from
    patients. The increase in the provision for doubtful accounts,
    as a percentage of revenues, can be attributed to an increasing
    amount of patient financial responsibility under certain managed
    care plans and same facility increases in uninsured emergency
    room visits of 7.3% and uninsured admissions of 9.4% in 2007
    compared to 2006. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for
    doubtful accounts represented approximately 89% of the
    $4.825 billion total patient due accounts receivable
    balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual
    discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for
    Medicaid coverage was being evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $197 million for 2006 to $206 million for 2007. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

Gains on investments for 2007 and 2006 of $8 million and
    $243 million, respectively, relate to sales of investment
    securities by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. The
    decrease in realized gains for 2007 was primarily due to the
    decision to liquidate our equity investment portfolio and
    reinvest in debt and interest-bearing investments during the
    fourth quarter of 2006. Net unrealized gains on investment
    securities declined from $25 million at December 31,
    2006 to $21 million at December 31, 2007.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenues, to 5.4% in 2007 from 5.5% in 2006. Purchases of
    property and equipment of $1.444 billion during 2007 were
    generally equivalent to depreciation expense for 2007 of
    $1.421 billion.

Interest expense increased to $2.215 billion for 2007 from
    $955 million for 2006. The increase in interest expense is
    primarily due to the increased debt related to the
    Recapitalization. Our average debt balance was
    $27.732 billion for 2007 compared to $13.811 billion
    for 2006. The average interest rate for our long-term debt
    decreased from 7.9% at December 31, 2006 to 7.6% at
    December 31, 2007.

Gains on sales of facilities were $471 million for 2007 and
    included a $312 million gain on the sale of our two
    Switzerland hospitals and a $131 million gain on the sale
    of a facility in Florida. Gains on sales of facilities were
    $205 million for 2006 and included a $92 million gain
    on the sale of four hospitals in West Virginia and Virginia and
    a $93 million gain on the sale of two hospitals in Florida.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
    increased from $201 million for 2006 to $208 million
    for 2007. The increase relates primarily to the operations of
    surgery centers and other outpatient services entities.

The effective tax rate was 26.6% for 2007 and 37.6% for 2006.
    Based on new information received in 2007 related primarily to
    tax positions taken in prior taxable periods, we reduced our
    provision for income taxes by $85 million, and by an
    additional $39 million to adjust 2006 state tax
    accruals to the amounts reported on completed

    costs. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective
    tax rate for 2007 would have been 37.0%.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses,
    servicing of our debt, capital expenditures on our existing
    properties and acquisitions of hospitals and other health care
    entities. Our primary cash sources are cash flow from operating
    activities, issuances of debt and equity securities and
    dispositions of hospitals and other health care entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $1.797 billion in 2008 compared to $1.396 billion in
    2007 and $1.845 billion in 2006. Working capital totaled
    $2.391 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    $2.356 billion at December 31, 2007. The
    $401 million increase in cash provided by operating
    activities for 2008, compared to 2007, relates primarily to
    changes in working capital items. The changes in accounts
    receivable (net of the provision for doubtful accounts),
    inventories and other assets, and accounts payable and accrued
    expenses contributed $42 million to cash provided by
    operating activities for 2008 while changes in these items
    decreased cash provided by operating activities by
    $485 million for 2007. The $449 million decrease in
    cash provided by operating activities for 2007, compared to
    2006, relates primarily to the combined impact of a
    $604 million increase in net cash payments for interest and
    income taxes and a $205 million increase from changes in
    working capital items. The net impact of the cash payments for
    interest and income taxes was an increase in cash payments of
    $111 million for 2008 compared to 2007 and an increase of
    $604 million for 2007 compared to 2006.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.467 billion,
    $479 million and $1.307 billion in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
    were $1.600 billion in 2008, $1.444 billion in 2007
    and $1.865 billion in 2006. We expended $85 million,
    $32 million and $112 million for acquisitions of
    hospitals and health care entities during 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions in all three years
    were generally comprised of outpatient and ancillary services
    entities and were funded by a combination of cash flows from
    operations and the issuance or incurrence of debt. Planned
    capital expenditures are expected to approximate
    $1.5 billion in 2009. At December 31, 2008, there were
    projects under construction which had an estimated additional
    cost to complete and equip over the next five years of
    $1.450 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures
    with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2008, we received cash proceeds of $143 million from
    dispositions of two hospitals, and $50 million from sales
    of other health care entities and real estate investments.
    During 2007, we sold three hospitals for cash proceeds of
    $661 million, and we also received cash proceeds of
    $106 million related primarily to the sales of real estate
    investments. The sales of nine hospitals were completed during
    2006 for cash proceeds of $560 million, and we also
    received cash proceeds of $91 million on the sales of real
    estate investments and our equity investment in a hospital joint
    venture.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $258 million in
    2008, $1.158 billion in 2007 and $240 million in 2006.
    During 2008 and 2007, we used cash proceeds from sales of
    facilities and available cash provided by operations to make net
    debt repayments of $260 million and $1.270 billion,
    respectively. The Recapitalization included the issuance of
    $19.964 billion of long-term debt, the receipt of
    $3.782 billion of equity contributions, the repurchase of
    $20.364 billion of common stock, the payment of
    $745 million for Recapitalization related fees and
    expenses, and the retirement of $3.182 billion of existing
    long-term debt. We may in the future repurchase portions of our
    debt securities, subject to certain limitations, from time to
    time in either the open market or through privately negotiated
    transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal
    requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend
    upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market
    conditions, and other factors,

    and Capital Resources (Continued)

including applicable securities laws. Funds for the repurchase
    of debt securities have, and are expected to, come primarily
    from cash generated from operations and borrowed funds.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
    capital include amounts available under our senior secured
    credit facilities ($1.858 billion as of December 31,
    2008 and $2.038 billion as of February 28,
    2009) and anticipated access to public and private debt
    markets.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiary,
    to maintain statutory equity and pay claims incurred prior to
    2007, totaled $1.622 billion and $1.899 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The insurance
    subsidiary maintained reserves for professional liability risk
    of $816 million and $1.165 billion at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence; however, since January 2007,
    this coverage is subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention. Claims payments, net of reinsurance
    recoveries, during the next twelve months are expected to
    approximate $250 million. We estimate that approximately
    $50 million of the expected net claim payments during the
    next twelve months will relate to claims incurred subsequent to
    2006.

Financing
    Activities

Due to the Recapitalization, we are a highly leveraged company
    with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled
    $26.989 billion and $27.308 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our interest
    expense was $2.021 billion for 2008 and $2.215 billion
    for 2007.

In connection with the Recapitalization, we entered into
    (i) a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based
    revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of 85% of
    eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and
    eligibility criteria (fully utilized at December 31, 2008)
    (the “ABL credit facility”) and (ii) a senior
    secured credit agreement (the “cash flow credit
    facility” and, together with the ABL credit facility, the
    “senior secured credit facilities”), consisting of a
    $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.858 billion available at December 31, 2008 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($2.525 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2008), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    ($8.624 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2008) and a €1.000 billion European term loan
    (€611 million, or $853 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2008).

Also in connection with the Recapitalization, we issued
    $4.200 billion of senior secured notes (comprised of
    $1.000 billion of


/


% notes
    due 2014 and $3.200 billion of


/

    due 2016) and $1.500 billion of

    in-kind senior secured toggle notes (which allow us, at our
    option, to pay interest

during the first five years) due 2016, which are subject to
    certain standard covenants. In November 2008, we elected to make
    an interest payment for the interest period ending in May 2009
    by paying in-kind instead of paying interest in cash.

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all
    existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material
    domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted
    Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated as of
    December 16, 1993 (except for certain special purpose
    subsidiaries that only guarantee and pledge their assets under
    our ABL credit facility). In addition, borrowings under the
    European term loan are guaranteed by all material, wholly-owned
    European subsidiaries.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts
    available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
    anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be
    sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next
    twelve months.

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $1.614 billion and $8 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2008, we had a net unrealized loss of
    $48 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash in
    excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
    expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a
    price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a
    normal market environment. At December 31, 2008, our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had invested $536 million
    ($573 million par value) in municipal, tax-exempt student
    loan auction rate securities which were classified as long-term
    investments. The auction rate securities (“ARS”) are
    publicly issued securities with long-term stated maturities for
    which the interest rates are reset through a Dutch auction every
    seven to 35 days. With the liquidity issues experienced in
    global credit and capital markets, the ARS held by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary have experienced multiple
    failed auctions, beginning on February 11, 2008, as the
    amount of securities submitted for sale exceeded the amount of
    purchase orders. There is a very limited market for the ARS at
    this time. We do not currently intend to attempt to sell the ARS
    as the liquidity needs of our insurance subsidiary are expected
    to be met by other investments in its investment portfolio.
    These securities continue to accrue and pay interest
    semi-annually based on the failed auction maximum rate formulas
    stated in their respective Official Statements. During the
    failed auction period beginning February 11, 2008 and
    ending December 31, 2008, certain issuers of our ARS have
    redeemed $93 million of our securities at par value. If
    uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue or
    there are ratings downgrades on the ARS held by our insurance
    subsidiary, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
    impairments on these long-term investments in future periods.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates and we periodically enter into interest rate swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our
    interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
    variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on
    common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have
    been recognized in the financial statements at their respective
    fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
    included in other comprehensive income.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately
    $5.055 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2008
    is subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining
    balance in long-term debt of $21.934 billion at
    December 31, 2008 is subject to fixed rates of interest.
    Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior
    secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable
    interest rates. Our variable rate debt is comprised primarily of
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities.
    Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our
    option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus


/


of 1% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or
    (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the
    relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings
    under the senior secured credit facilities, with the exception
    of term loan B where the margin is static, may be reduced
    subject to attaining certain leverage ratios. The average rate
    for our long-term debt decreased from 7.6% at December 31,
    2007 to 6.9% at December 31, 2008. On February 16,
    2007, we amended the cash flow credit facility to reduce the
    applicable margins with respect to the term borrowings
    thereunder. On June 20, 2007, we amended the ABL credit
    facility to reduce the applicable margin with respect to
    borrowings thereunder.

    INC.

    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND

Market
    Risk (Continued)

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was
    $20.225 billion at December 31, 2008. The estimates of
    fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.
    Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the
    potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would
    be approximately $51 million. To mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of
    our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

Our international operations and the European term loan expose
    us to market risks associated with foreign currencies. In order
    to mitigate the currency exposure related to debt service
    obligations through December 31, 2011 under the European
    term loan, we have entered into cross currency swap agreements.
    A cross currency swap is an agreement between two parties to
    exchange a stream of principal and interest payments in one
    currency for a stream of principal and interest payments in
    another currency over a specified period.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they
    are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
    subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
    the hedged items when they occur. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a
    hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the
    remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Effects
    of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
    certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
    for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare
    patients are established under the federal government’s
    prospective payment system. Total fee-for-service Medicare
    revenues approximated 23% in 2008, 24% in 2007 and 25% in 2006
    of our total patient revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry operating margins
    have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure
    because of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses
    in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the
    Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
    regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain
    operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare
    patients is limited.

IRS
    Disputes

We are currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
    Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) certain claimed
    deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS in connection
    with its examinations of the 2003 and 2004 federal income
    returns for HCA and 17 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). The disputed items include the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues and our method
    for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts.

IRS
    Disputes (Continued)

Eight taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1995
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year of 13 affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are
    pending before the IRS Examination Division or the United States
    Tax Court as of December 31, 2008. The IRS began an audit
    of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns for HCA and
    seven affiliated partnerships during 2008.

Management believes that HCA, its predecessors and affiliates
    properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance
    with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS and
    that final resolution of these disputes will not have a
    material, adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position. However, if payments due upon final
    resolution of these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such
    resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
    term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2008.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this

has issued a report on our internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included herein.

HCA Inc.

We have audited HCA Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). HCA Inc.’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
    included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Inc. maintained, in all material respects,
    effective internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of
    income, stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2008, and our report dated March 3, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

    Information

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $13.550 billion and
    €1.000 billion senior secured cash flow credit
    facility, dated as of November 17, 2006, as amended
    February 16, 2007 (the “cash flow credit
    facility”), to allow for one or more future issuances of
    additional secured notes, which may include notes that are
    secured on a

pari passu

basis or on a junior basis with
    the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as
    (1) such notes do not require any scheduled payment or
    redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B final maturity
    date as currently in effect and (2) the proceeds from any
    such issuance are used within three business days of receipt to
    prepay term loans under the cash flow credit facility in
    accordance with the terms of the cash flow credit facility. The
    U.S. security documents related to the cash flow credit
    facility were also amended and restated, or in the case of the
    U.S. mortgages, will be amended and restated, in connection
    with the amendment in order to give effect to the security
    interests granted to holders of such additional secured notes.

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $2.000 billion senior
    secured asset-based revolving credit facility, dated as of

    obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as the
    proceeds from any such issuance are used to prepay term loans
    under the cash flow credit facility within three business days
    of the receipt thereof. The amendment to the ABL credit facility
    also altered the excess facility availability requirement to
    include a separate minimum facility availability requirement
    applicable to the ABL credit facility, and increased the
    applicable LIBOR and ABR margins for all borrowings under the
    ABL credit facility by 0.25% each.

Audit
    Committee Financial Expert

Our Audit and Compliance Committee is composed of Christopher J.
    Birosak, Thomas F. Frist III, Christopher R. Gordon and James C.
    Momtazee. In light of our status as a closely held company and
    the absence of a public listing or trading market for our common
    stock, our Board has not designated any member of the Audit and
    Compliance Committee as an “audit committee financial
    expert.” Though not formally considered by our Board given
    that our securities are not traded on any national securities
    exchange, based upon the listing standards of the New York Stock
    Exchange (the “NYSE”), the national securities
    exchange upon which our common stock was listed prior to the
    Merger, we do not believe that any of Messrs. Birosak,
    Frist, Gordon or Momtazee would be considered independent
    because of their relationships with certain affiliates of the
    funds and other entities which hold significant interests in
    Hercules Holding, which owns 97.3% of our outstanding common
    stock, and other relationships with us. See Item 13,
    “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.”

Code of
    Ethics

We have a Code of Conduct which is applicable to all our
    directors, officers and employees (the “Code of
    Conduct”). The Code of Conduct is available on the Ethics
    and Compliance and Corporate Governance pages of our website at
    www.hcahealthcare.com. To the extent required pursuant to
    applicable SEC regulations, we intend to post amendments to or
    waivers from our Code of Conduct (to the extent applicable to
    our chief executive officer, principal financial officer or
    principal accounting officer) at this location on our website or
    report the same on a Current Report on

Form 8-K.

Our Code of Conduct is available free of charge upon request to
    our Corporate Secretary, HCA Inc., One Park Plaza, Nashville, TN
    37203.

Section 16(a)
    Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
    requires our directors, executive officers and greater than
    ten-percent shareholders to file initial reports of ownership
    and reports of changes in ownership of any of our securities
    with the SEC and us. We believe that during the 2008 fiscal
    year, all of our directors, executive officers and greater than
    ten-percent shareholders complied with the requirements of
    Section 16(a). This belief is based on our review of forms
    filed or written notice that no reports were required.

Item 11.

Executive
    Compensation

Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis

The Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the
    Board of Directors is generally charged with the oversight of
    our executive compensation and rewards programs. The Committee
    is currently composed of John P. Connaughton, Michael W.
    Michelson and George A. Bitar. In 2008, the Committee also
    included Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D., and
    determinations with respect to 2008 compensation were made by
    such Committee. Responsibilities of the Committee include the
    review and approval of the following items:

•

Executive compensation strategy and philosophy;

•

Compensation arrangements for executive management;

•

Design and administration of the annual cash-based Senior
    Officer Performance Excellence Program (“PEP”);

•

Design and administration of our equity incentive plans;



•

Executive benefits and perquisites (including the HCA
    Restoration Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement
    Plan); and

•

Any other executive compensation or benefits related items
    deemed appropriate by the Committee.

In addition, the Committee considers the proper alignment of
    executive pay policies with Company values and strategy by
    overseeing employee compensation policies, corporate performance
    measurement and assessment, and Chief Executive Officer
    performance assessment. The Committee may retain the services of
    independent outside consultants, as it deems appropriate, to
    assist in the strategic review of programs and arrangements
    relating to executive compensation and performance.

The following executive compensation discussion and analysis
    describes the principles underlying our executive compensation
    policies and decisions as well as the material elements of
    compensation for our named executive officers. Our named
    executive officers for 2008 were:

Effective December 31, 2008, Mr. Bovender retired as
    Chief Executive Officer but retained the role of Chairman of the
    Board, and effective January 1, 2009, Mr. Bracken was
    appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of
    the Company.

As discussed in more detail below, the material elements and
    structure of the named executive officers’ compensation
    program for 2008 was negotiated and determined in connection
    with the Merger.

Compensation
    Philosophy and Objectives

The core philosophy of our executive compensation program is to
    support the Company’s primary objective of providing the
    highest quality health care to our patients while enhancing the
    long term value of the Company to our shareholders.
    Specifically, the Committee believes the most effective
    executive compensation program (for all executives, including
    named executive officers):

•

Reinforces HCA’s strategic initiatives;

•

Aligns the economic interests of our executives with those of
    our shareholders; and

•

Encourages attraction and long term retention of key
    contributors.

The Committee is committed to a strong, positive link between
    our objectives and our compensation and benefits practices.

Our compensation philosophy also allows for flexibility in
    establishing executive compensation based on an evaluation of
    information prepared by management or other advisors and other
    subjective and objective considerations deemed appropriate by
    the Committee. The Committee will also consider the
    recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. This flexibility
    is important to ensure our compensation programs are competitive
    and that our compensation decisions appropriately reflect the
    unique contributions and characteristics of our executives.



Compensation
    Structure and Benchmarking

Our compensation program is heavily weighted towards
    performance-based compensation, reflecting our philosophy of
    increasing the long-term value of the Company and supporting
    strategic imperatives. Total direct compensation and other
    benefits consist of the following elements:

Total Direct Compensation

•   Base Salary

•   Annual Cash-Based Incentives (offered
    through our PEP)

•   Long-Term Equity Incentives (in the form
    of Stock Options)

Other Benefits

•   Retirement Plans

•   Limited Perquisites and Other Personal
    Benefits

•   Severance Benefits

The Committee does not support rigid adherence to benchmarks or
    compensatory formulas and strives to make compensation decisions
    which effectively support our compensation objectives and
    reflect the unique attributes of the Company and each executive.
    Our general practice, however, with respect to pay positioning,
    is that executive base salaries and annual incentive (PEP)
    target values should generally position total annual cash
    compensation between the median and 75th percentile of
    similarly-sized general industry companies. We utilize the
    general industry as our primary source for competitive pay
    levels because HCA is significantly larger than its industry
    peers. See the discussion of benchmarking below for further
    information. The named executive officers’ pay fell within
    the range noted above for jobs with equivalent market
    comparisons.

The cash compensation mix between salary and PEP is currently
    more weighted towards salary rather than PEP than competitive
    practice among our general industry peers would suggest. Over
    time, we intend to continue moving towards a mix of cash
    compensation that will place a greater emphasis on annual
    performance-based compensation.

Although we look at competitive long-term equity incentive award
    values in similarly-sized general industry companies when
    assessing the competitiveness of our compensation programs, we
    did not base our 2007 stock option grants on these levels since
    equity is structured differently in closely held companies than
    in publicly-traded companies. As is typical in similar
    situations, the Investors wanted to share a certain percentage
    of the equity with executives shortly after the consummation of
    the Merger and establish performance objectives and incentives
    up front in lieu of annual grants to ensure our executives’
    long-term economic interests would be aligned with those of the
    Investors. This pool of equity was then further allocated based
    on the executives’ anticipated impact on, and potential
    for, driving Company strategy and performance. The resulting
    total direct pay mix is heavily weighted towards
    performance-based pay (PEP plus stock options) rather than fixed
    pay, which the Committee believes reflects the compensation
    philosophy and objectives discussed above. No additional long
    term equity incentives were granted to the named executive
    officers in 2008.

Compensation
    Process

While our 2008 named executive officer compensation was largely
    determined at the time of the Merger, the Committee ensures that
    executives’ pay levels are generally consistent with the
    compensation strategy described above, in part, by conducting
    annual assessments of competitive executive compensation.
    Management (but no named executive officer), in collaboration
    with the Committee’s independent consultant, Semler Brossy
    Consulting Group, LLC, collects and presents compensation data
    from similarly-sized general industry companies, based to the
    extent possible on comparable position matches and compensation
    components. The following nationally recognized survey sources
    were utilized in anticipation of establishing 2008 executive
    compensation:

Number of

Companies in

Survey

Revenue Scope (Median Revenue)

Sample

Towers Perrin Executive Compensation Database

Greater than $20B ($35.0B

)


Hewitt Total Compensation Measurement

$10B - $25B ($15.0B

)


Hewitt Total Compensation Measurement

Greater than $25B ($46.5B

)




These particular revenue scopes were selected because they were
    the closest approximations to HCA’s revenue size. Each
    survey that provided an appropriate position match and
    sufficient sample size to be used in the compensation review was
    weighted equally. For this purpose, the two Hewitt survey cuts
    were considered as one survey, and we used a weighted average of
    the two surveys (65% for the $10B — $25B cut and 35%
    for the Greater than $25B).

Data was also collected from health care providers within our
    industry including Community Health Systems, Inc., Health
    Management Associates, Inc., Kindred Healthcare, Inc., LifePoint
    Hospitals, Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corporation and Universal
    Health Services, Inc. These health care providers are used only
    as a secondary point of reference for industry practices since
    we are significantly larger than these companies. The data from
    this analysis did not affect named executive officer pay level
    decisions in 2008. Semler Brossy also performed a competitive
    pay analysis specific for the Chairman of the Board, the
    President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice
    President and Chief Financial Officer to be utilized in setting
    2009 compensation for Mr. Bovender, Mr. Bracken and
    Mr. Johnson. A custom proxy analysis was utilized, covering 150
    selected companies in the S&P 500 (excluding the financial
    services sector). The following cuts of this database were used
    for market comparisons: (i) companies with $15 billion
    to $35 billion in revenues (52 companies) and
    (ii) companies in the broader health care sector
    (21 companies).

Consistent with our flexible compensation philosophy, the
    Committee is not required to approve compensation precisely
    reflecting the results of these surveys, and may also consider,
    among other factors (typically not reflected in these surveys):
    the requirements of the applicable employment agreements, the
    executive’s individual performance during the year, his or
    her projected role and responsibilities for the coming year, his
    or her actual and potential impact on the successful execution
    of Company strategy, recommendations from our chief executive
    officer and compensation consultants, an officer’s prior
    compensation, experience, and professional status, internal pay
    equity considerations, and employment market conditions and
    compensation practices within our peer group. The weighting of
    these and other relevant factors is determined on a

case-by-case

basis for each executive upon consideration of the relevant
    facts and circumstances.

Employment
    Agreements

In connection with the Merger, we entered into employment
    agreements with each of our named executive officers and certain
    other members of senior management to help ensure the retention
    of those executives critical to the future success of the
    Company. Among other things, these agreements set the
    executives’ compensation terms, their rights upon a
    termination of employment, and restrictive covenants around
    non-competition, non-solicitation, and confidentiality. These
    terms and conditions are further explained in the remaining
    portion of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements.”

In light of Mr. Bovender’s retirement from the
    position of Chief Executive Officer, effective December 31,
    2008, and continuing service to the Company as executive
    Chairman until December 15, 2009, the Company entered into
    an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with
    Mr. Bovender, effective December 31, 2008. The
    material amendments to Mr. Bovender’s prior employment
    agreement as set forth in the Amended and Restated Employment
    Agreement are described below under
    “Mr. Bovender’s Severance Benefits” and
    under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table
    and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements.”

The Company also amended Mr. Bracken’s employment
    agreement, effective January 1, 2009, to reflect his
    appointment to the position of Chief Executive Officer and
    President.

Elements
    of Compensation

Base
    Salary

Base salaries are intended to provide reasonable and competitive
    fixed compensation for regular job duties. The threshold base
    salaries for our executives are set forth in their employment
    agreements. We did not increase named executive officer base
    salaries in 2008, other than an approximate 5.3% increase in
    Mr. Johnson’s base salary



in order to better align his salary with market for his position
    as Chief Financial Officer based on general industry surveys. In
    light of Mr. Bovender’s retirement from the position
    of Chief Executive Officer and continuing role as Chairman and
    Mr. Bracken’s assumption of the responsibilities of
    Chief Executive Officer and President, Mr. Bovender’s
    base salary for 2009 was reduced to approximately
    $1.144 million for his Employment Term (as described
    further in “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation
    Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table —
    Employment Agreements.”), and Mr. Bracken’s 2009
    base salary was increased to $1.325 million. Similarly,
    taking into consideration the additional responsibilities being
    assumed by the position of Executive Vice President and Chief
    Financial Officer and relevant market comparables,
    Mr. Johnson’s 2009 salary was set at $850,000,
    reflecting an increase of approximately 7.6%. In light of our
    goal of reducing the emphasis of base salary in our cash
    compensation mix, we do not intend to provide salary increases
    to any of our named executive officers in 2009, other than those
    described above.

Annual
    Incentive Compensation: PEP

The PEP is intended to reward named executive officers for
    annual financial performance, with the goals of providing high
    quality health care for our patients and increasing shareholder
    value. Each named executive officer in the Company’s

2008-2009

Senior Officer Performance Excellence Program

(“2008-2009

PEP”) was assigned a 2008 annual award target expressed as
    a percentage of salary ranging from 66% to 126% (see individual
    targets in table below). In light of our goal to further
    emphasize performance-based pay, we increased the named
    executive officers’ PEP target opportunities by
    approximately 6% for 2008 in lieu of salary increases (with the
    exception of Mr. Johnson’s 2008 salary increase).
    These targets are intended to provide a meaningful incentive for
    executives to achieve or exceed performance goals.

The

2008-2009

PEP was designed to provide 100% of the target award for target
    performance, 50% of the target award for a minimum acceptable
    (threshold) level of performance, and a maximum of 200% of the
    target award for maximum performance, while no payments are made
    for performance below threshold levels. The Committee believes
    this payout curve is consistent with competitive practice. More
    importantly, it promotes and rewards continuous growth as
    performance goals have consistently been set at increasingly
    higher levels each year. Actual awards under the PEP are
    generally determined using the following two steps:

1. The executive’s conduct must reflect our Mission
    and Values by upholding our Code of Conduct and following our
    compliance policies and procedures. This step is critical to
    reinforcing our commitment to integrity and the delivery of high
    quality health care. In the event the Committee determines the
    participant’s conduct during the fiscal year is not in
    compliance with the first step, he or she will not be eligible
    for an incentive award.

2. The actual award amount is determined based upon Company
    performance. In 2008, the PEP for all named executive officers,
    other than Mr. Hazen, incorporated one Company financial
    performance measure, EBITDA, defined in the 2008-2009 PEP as
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization,
    minority interest expense, gains or losses on sales of
    facilities, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, asset or
    investment impairment charges, restructuring charges, and any
    other significant nonrecurring non-cash gains or charges (but
    excluding any expenses for share-based compensation under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

“Share-Based

Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”) with respect to any
    awards granted under the 2008-2009 PEP) (“EBITDA”).
    The Company EBITDA target for 2008 was $4.720 billion
    ($4.714 billion after adjustment) for the named executive
    officers. Mr. Hazen’s 2008 PEP, as the Western Group
    President, was based 50% on Company EBITDA and 50% on Western
    Group EBITDA (with a Western Group EBITDA target for 2008 of
    $2.328 billion) to ensure his accountability for his
    group’s results. The Committee chose to base annual
    incentives on EBITDA for a number of reasons:

•

It effectively measures overall Company performance;

•

It is an important surrogate for cash flow, a critical metric
    related to paying down the Company’s significant debt
    obligation;

•

It is the key metric driving the valuation in the internal
    Company model, consistent with the valuation approach used by
    industry analysts; and

•

It is consistent with the metric used for the vesting of the
    financial performance portion of our option grants.



These EBITDA targets should not be understood as
    management’s predictions of future performance or other
    guidance and investors should not apply these in any other
    context. Our 2008 threshold and maximum goals were set at
    approximately +/- 3.6% of the target goal to reflect likely
    performance volatility. EBITDA targets were linked to the
    Company’s short-term and long-term business objectives to
    ensure incentives are provided for appropriate annual growth and
    stretch performance.

Pursuant to the terms of the

2008-2009

PEP and the named executive officer employment agreements, the
    Committee exercised its ability to make adjustments to the
    Company’s 2008 EBITDA performance target for dispositions
    of facilities occurring during the 2008 fiscal year. The
    adjustments to the target resulted in a decrease of
    approximately $6 million.

The Committee intends to set the named executive officers’
    2009 target performance goals based on aggressive, yet
    realistic, expectations of Company performance ensuring
    successful execution of our plans in order to realize the most
    value from these awards. While we do not intend to disclose our
    2009 PEP EBITDA target as an understanding of that target is not
    necessary for a fair understanding of the named executive
    officers’ compensation for 2008 and could result in
    competitive harm and market confusion, we consistently set
    targets that require an increase in EBITDA year over year to
    promote continuous growth consistent with our business plan.

Upon review of the Company’s 2008 financial performance,
    the Committee determined that Company EBITDA performance for the
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 fell below the target
    performance, but above threshold performance as set by the
    Compensation Committee; likewise, the EBITDA performance of the
    Western Group also exceeded threshold performance but was less
    than target performance. Accordingly, the 2008 PEP will be paid
    out as follows to the named executive officers (the actual 2008
    PEP payout amounts are included in the “Non-Equity
    Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the Summary
    Compensation Table):

In 2008, the

2008-2009

PEP was approved by the Committee. Therefore, the 2009 PEP
    program will work under the same plan as in 2008. Each named
    executive officer in the Company’s

2008-2009

PEP was assigned a maximum 2009 annual award target expressed as
    a percentage of salary ranging from 72% to 132% which under the
    terms of the

2008-2009

PEP applies to the lesser of (a) the Named Executive
    Officer’s 2009 base salary, or (b) 125% of the Named
    Executive Officer’s 2008 base salary. The Committee has the
    discretion to reduce, but not increase, the 2009 Threshold,
    Target and Maximum percentages as set forth in the

2008-2009

PEP. Mr. Bovender’s 2009 PEP target or Annual Bonus is
    set forth in his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement,
    effective December 31, 2008, as described in
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table —
    Mr. Bovender’s Employment Agreement”. The
    Committee set Mr. Bracken’s 2009 target percentage at
    130% of his 2009 base salary in connection with his appointment
    as Chief Executive Officer and President and amended the

2008-2009

PEP to set Mr. Johnson’s 2009 target percentage at 80%
    of his 2009 base salary in light of the additional
    responsibilities assumed by the position of Executive Vice
    President and Chief Financial Officer. The Committee anticipates
    that the 2009 PEP target percentage will remain at 66% of base
    salary for Mr. Hazen and Ms. Wallace, respectively.
    The Committee also has the ability to supplement the financial
    metrics and weightings with additional measures other than
    EBITDA including: (a) operating income, profit or
    efficiencies; (b) return on equity, assets, capital,
    capital employed or investment; (c) after-tax operating
    income; (d) net income; (e) earnings or book value per
    share; (f) cash flow(s); (g) stock price or total
    shareholder return; (h) debt reduction; (i) strategic
    business objectives, consisting of one or more objectives based
    on meeting specified cost targets, business expansion goals and
    goals relating to acquisitions or divestitures; or (j) any
    combination thereof.



Long-Term
    Equity Incentive Awards: Options

In connection with the Merger, the Board of Directors approved
    and adopted the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of
    HCA Inc. and its Affiliates (the “2006 Plan”). The
    purpose of the 2006 Plan is to:

•

Promote our long term financial interests and growth by
    attracting and retaining management and other personnel and key
    service providers with the training, experience and abilities to
    enable them to make substantial contributions to the success of
    our business;

•

Motivate management personnel by means of growth-related
    incentives to achieve long range goals; and

•

Further the alignment of interests of participants with those of
    our shareholders through opportunities for increased stock or
    stock-based ownership in the Company.

In January 2007, pursuant to the terms of the named executive
    officers’ respective employment agreements, the Committee
    approved long-term stock option grants to our named executive
    officers under the 2006 Plan consisting solely of a one-time,
    multi-year stock option grant in lieu of annual long-term equity
    incentive award grants (“New Options”). In addition to
    the New Options granted in 2007, the Company committed to grant
    the named executive officers 2x Time Options in their respective
    employment agreements, as described in more detail below under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements.” The Committee believes that stock options are
    the most effective long-term vehicle to directly align the
    interests of executives with those of our shareholders by
    motivating performance that results in the long-term
    appreciation of the Company’s value, since they only
    provide value to the executive if the value of the Company
    increases. As is typical in leveraged buyout situations, the
    Committee determined that granting all of the stock options
    (except the 2x Time Options) up front rather than annually was
    appropriate to aid in retaining key leaders critical to the
    Company’s success over the next several years and, coupled
    with the executives’ significant personal investments in
    connection with the Merger, provide an equity incentive and
    stake in the Company that directly aligns the long-term economic
    interests of the executives with those of the Investors.

The New Options have a ten year term and are divided so that


/


are time vested options,


/


are EBITDA-based performance vested options and


/


are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors, each as described below. The combination of time,
    performance and investor return based vesting of these awards is
    designed to compensate executives for long term commitment to
    the Company, while motivating sustained increases in our
    financial performance and helping ensure the Sponsors have
    received an appropriate return on their invested capital before
    executives receive significant value from these grants.

The time vested options are granted to aid in retention.
    Consistent with this goal, the time vested options granted in
    2007 vest and become exercisable in equal increments of 20% on
    each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. The time
    vested options have an exercise price equivalent to fair market
    value on the date of grant. Since our common stock is not
    currently traded on a national securities exchange, fair market
    value was determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board
    of Directors after consultation with the Chief Executive Officer
    and other advisors.

The EBITDA-based performance vested options are intended to
    motivate sustained improvement in long-term performance.
    Consistent with this goal, the EBITDA-based performance vested
    options granted in 2007 are eligible to vest and become
    exercisable in equal increments of 20% at the end of fiscal
    years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if certain annual EBITDA
    performance targets are achieved. These EBITDA performance
    targets were established at the time of the Merger and can be
    adjusted by the Board of Directors in consultation with the
    Chief Executive Officer as described below. We chose EBITDA
    (defined in the award agreements as earnings before interest,
    taxes, depreciation, amortization, minority interest expense,
    gains or losses on sales of facilities, gains or losses on
    extinguishment of debt, asset or investment impairment charges,
    restructuring charges, and any other significant nonrecurring
    non-cash gains or charges (but excluding any expenses for
    share-based compensation under SFAS 123(R) with respect to
    any awards granted under the 2006 Plan) as the performance
    metric since it is a key driver of our valuation and for other
    reasons as described above in the “Annual Incentive
    Compensation: PEP” section of this Compensation Discussion
    and Analysis. Due to the number of events that can occur within
    our industry in any given year that are beyond the control of
    management but may significantly impact our financial
    performance (e.g., health care regulations, industry-wide
    significant fluctuations in volume, etc.), we have



incorporated

“catch-up”

vesting provisions. The EBITDA-based performance vested options
    may vest and become exercisable on a “catch up” basis,
    such that, options that were eligible to vest but failed to vest
    due to our failure to achieve prior EBITDA targets will vest if
    at the end of any subsequent year or at the end of fiscal year
    2012, the cumulative total EBITDA earned in all prior years
    exceeds the cumulative EBITDA target at the end of such fiscal
    year.

As discussed above, we do not intend to disclose the

2009-2011

EBITDA performance targets as they reflect competitive,
    sensitive information regarding our budget. However, we
    deliberately set our targets at increasingly higher levels.
    Thus, while designed to be attainable, target performance levels
    for these years require strong, improving performance and
    execution, which in our view, provides an incentive firmly
    aligned with shareholder interests.

As with the EBITDA targets under our

2008-2009

PEP, pursuant to the terms of the 2006 Plan and the Stock Option
    Agreements governing the 2007 grants, the Board of Directors, in
    consultation with our Chief Executive Officer, has the ability
    to adjust the established EBITDA targets for significant events,
    changes in accounting rules and other customary adjustment
    events. We believe these adjustments may be necessary in order
    to effectuate the intents and purposes of our compensation plans
    and to avoid unintended consequences that are inconsistent with
    these intents and purposes. The Board of Directors exercised its
    ability to make adjustments to the Company’s

2008-2011

EBITDA performance targets (including cumulative EBITDA targets)
    for facility dispositions and acquisitions and accounting
    changes occurring during the 2008 fiscal year.

The options that vest based on investment return to the Sponsors
    are intended to align the interests of executives with those of
    our principal shareholders to ensure shareholders receive their
    expected return on their investment before the executives can
    receive their gains on this portion of the option grant. These
    options vest and become exercisable with respect to 10% of the
    common stock subject to such options at the end of fiscal years
    2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return (as
    defined below) is at least equal to two times the price paid to
    shareholders in the Merger (or $102.00), and with respect to an
    additional 10% at the end of fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010
    and 2011 if the Investor Return is at least equal to

two-and-a-half

times the price paid to shareholders in the Merger (or $127.50).
    “Investor Return” means, on any of the first five
    anniversaries of the closing date of the Merger, or any date
    thereafter, all cash proceeds actually received by affiliates of
    the Sponsors after the closing date in respect of their common
    stock, including the receipt of any cash dividends or other cash
    distributions (including the fair market value of any
    distribution of common stock by the Sponsors to their limited
    partners), determined on a fully diluted, per share basis. The
    Sponsor investment return options also may become vested and
    exercisable on a “catch up” basis if the relevant
    Investor Return is achieved at any time occurring prior to the
    expiration of such options.

Upon review of the Company’s 2008 financial performance,
    the Committee determined that the Company achieved the 2008
    EBITDA performance target of $4.603 billion
    ($4.592 billion after adjustment) under the New Option
    awards; therefore, pursuant to the terms of the 2007 Stock
    Option Agreements, 20% of each named executive officer’s
    EBITDA-based performance vested options vested as of
    December 31, 2008. Further, 20% of each named executive
    officer’s time vested options vested on the second
    anniversary of their grant date, January 30, 2009. No
    portion of the options that vest based on Investor Return vested
    as of the end of the 2008 fiscal year; however, such options
    remain subject to the “catch up” vesting provisions
    described above.

For additional information concerning the options awarded in
    2007, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

As discussed above, except in the cases of promotions or new
    hires, the Committee does not intend to award additional stock
    options to our named executive officers (other than the 2x Time
    Options the Company committed to grant the named executive
    officers in their respective employment agreements, as described
    in more detail below under “Narrative Disclosure to Summary
    Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Employment Agreements”). Grants made in
    connection with promotions and new hires will be formally
    approved by the Committee. The exercise price of grants made in
    connection with promotions and new hires will be based on the
    quarterly fair market value as determined reasonably and in good
    faith by the Board of Directors after consultation with the
    Chief Executive Officer and other advisors. We anticipate that
    any option grants approved under the 2006 Plan in 2009 (other
    than the 2x Time Options) will be structured identical to those
    granted in 2007



except that the options will vest over a three year period
    rather than a five year period, with the time vested options
    vesting and becoming exercisable in equal increments of
    approximately 33% on each of the first three anniversaries of
    the grant date, the EBITDA-based performance vested options
    being eligible to vest and become exercisable in equal
    increments of approximately 33% at the end of fiscal years 2009,
    2010 and 2011 if the applicable EBITDA performance targets are
    achieved (with the same “catch up” provision as
    described above), and the options that vest based on investment
    return to the Sponsors vesting and becoming exercisable with
    respect to approximately 16.67% of the common stock subject to
    such options at the end of fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 if
    the Investor Return (as defined above) is at least equal to two
    times the price paid to shareholders in the Merger (or $102.00),
    and with respect to an additional approximately 16.67% at the
    end of fiscal years 2009, 2010 and 2011 if the Investor Return
    is at least equal to

two-and-a-half

times the price paid to shareholders in the Merger (or $127.50)
    (provided that the investor return options granted in
    2009 may also become vested and exercisable on a
    “catch up” basis if the relevant Investor Return is
    achieved prior to the eighth anniversary of the grant date).

Ownership
    Guidelines

While we have maintained stock ownership guidelines in the past,
    as a non-listed company, we no longer have a policy regarding
    stock ownership guidelines. However, we do believe equity
    ownership aligns our executive officers’ interests with
    those of the Investors. Accordingly, all of our named executive
    officers were required to rollover at least half their
    pre-Merger equity and, therefore, maintain significant stock
    ownership in the Company. See Item 12, “Security
    Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and
    Related Stockholder Matters.”

Retirement
    Plans

At the beginning of 2008, we maintained two qualified retirement
    plans, the HCA 401(k) Plan and the HCA Retirement Plan, to aid
    in retention and to assist employees in providing for their
    retirement. As of April 1, 2008, the HCA Retirement Plan
    merged into the HCA 401(k) Plan resulting in one qualified
    retirement plan. Generally all employees who have completed the
    required service are eligible to participate in the HCA 401(k)
    Plan. Each of our named executive officers participates in the
    plan. For additional information on these plans, including
    amounts contributed by HCA in 2008 to the named executive
    officers, see the Summary Compensation Table and related
    footnotes and narratives and “Pension Benefits.”

Our key executives, including the named executive officers, also
    participate in two supplemental retirement programs. The
    Committee and the Board initially approved these supplemental
    programs to:

•

Recognize significant long-term contributions and commitments by
    executives to the Company and to performance over an extended
    period of time;

•

Induce our executives to continue in our employ through a
    specified normal retirement age (initially 62 through 65, but
    reduced to 60 upon the change in control at the time of the
    Merger in 2006); and

•

Provide a competitive benefit to aid in attracting and retaining
    key executive talent.

The Restoration Plan provides a benefit to replace a portion of
    the contributions lost in the HCA 401(k) Plan due to
    certain IRS limitations. Effective January 1, 2008,
    participants in the SERP (described below) are no longer
    eligible for Restoration Plan contributions; however, the
    hypothetical accounts maintained for each named executive
    officer as of January 1, 2008 will continue to be
    maintained and will be increased or decreased with investment
    earnings based on the actual investment return. For additional
    information concerning the Restoration Plan, see
    “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation.”

Key executives also participate in the Supplemental Executive
    Retirement Plan, or the “SERP,” adopted in 2001. The
    SERP benefit brings the total value of annual retirement income
    to a specific income replacement level. For named executive
    officers with 25 years or more of service, this income
    replacement level is 60% of final average pay (base salary and
    PEP payouts) at normal retirement, a competitive level of
    benefit at the time the plan was implemented. Due to the Merger,
    all participants are fully vested in their SERP benefits and the
    plan is now frozen to new entrants. For additional information
    concerning the SERP, see “Pension Benefits.”



In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any payments already made. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.

Personal
    Benefits

Our executive officers receive limited, if any, benefits outside
    of those offered to our other employees. Generally, we provide
    these benefits to increase travel and work efficiencies and
    allow for more productive use of the executive’s time.
    Mr. Bovender and Mr. Bracken are permitted to use the
    Company aircraft for personal trips, subject to the
    aircraft’s availability. Other named executive officers may
    have their spouses accompany them on business trips taken on the
    Company aircraft, subject to seat availability. In addition,
    there are times when it is appropriate for an executive’s
    spouse to attend events related to our business. On those
    occasions, we will pay for the travel expenses of the
    executive’s spouse. We will, on an as needed basis, provide
    mobile telephones and personal digital assistants to our
    employees and certain of our executive officers have obtained
    such devices through us. The value of these personal benefits,
    if any, is included in the executive officer’s income for
    tax purposes and, in certain limited circumstances, the
    additional income attributed to an executive officer as a result
    of one or more of these benefits will be grossed up to cover the
    taxes due on that income. Except as otherwise discussed herein,
    other welfare and employee-benefit programs are the same for all
    of our eligible employees, including our executive officers. For
    additional information, see footnote (6) to the Summary
    Compensation Table.

Severance
    and Change in Control Benefits

As noted above, all of our named executive officers have entered
    into employment agreements, which provide, among other things,
    each executive’s rights upon a termination of employment in
    exchange for non-competition, non-solicitation, and
    confidentiality covenants. We believe that reasonable severance
    benefits are appropriate in order to be competitive in our
    executive retention efforts. These benefits should reflect the
    fact that it may be difficult for such executives to find
    comparable employment within a short period of time. We also
    believe that these types of agreements are appropriate and
    customary in situations such as the Merger wherein the
    executives have made significant personal investments in the
    Company and that investment is generally illiquid for a
    significant period of time. Finally, we believe formalized
    severance arrangements are common benefits offered by employers
    competing for similar senior executive talent.

Severance
    Benefits for Named Executive Officers (other than
    Chairman)

If employment is terminated by the Company without
    “cause” or by the executive for “good
    reason” (whether or not the termination was in connection
    with a

change-in-control),

the executive would be entitled to “accrued rights”
    (Cause, good reason and accrued rights are as defined in
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements”) plus:

•

Subject to restrictive covenants and the signing of a general
    release of claims, an amount equal to two times for
    Mr. Hazen and Ms. Wallace and three times in the case
    of Messrs. Bracken and Johnson the sum of base salary plus
    PEP paid or payable in respect of the fiscal year immediately
    preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, payable
    over a two year period;

•

Pro-rata bonus; and

•

Continued coverage under our group health plans during the
    period over which the cash severance is paid.

Additionally, unvested options will be forfeited; however,
    vested New Options will remain exercisable until the first
    anniversary of the termination of the executive’s
    employment.

Because we believe that a termination by the executive for good
    reason (a constructive termination) is conceptually the same as
    an actual termination by the Company without cause, we believe
    it is appropriate to provide severance benefits following such a
    constructive termination of the named executive officer’s
    employment. All of our severance provisions are believed to be
    within the realm of competitive practice and are intended to
    provide fair and reasonable compensation to the executive upon a
    termination event.



Mr. Bovender’s
    Severance Benefits

In light of his long-term service to the Company and his
    retirement from the position of Chief Executive Officer, the
    Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment
    Agreement with Mr. Bovender, effective December 31,
    2008 (the “Amended Employment Agreement”).
    Mr. Bovender’s Amended Employment Agreement provides,
    effective as of the expiration of the Employment Term (as
    defined in “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation
    Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table —
    Employment Agreements”) or Mr. Bovender’s sooner
    voluntary termination for any reason (including by reason of
    death or disability, but other than for “good
    reason”), that Mr. Bovender would be entitled to
    receive the “accrued rights” as described above for
    the other named executive officers. Mr. Bovender would also
    be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his bonus under the

2008-2009

PEP based on the Company’s actual results for 2009
    (“Mr. Bovender’s Prorated Bonus”).
    Additionally, in the event Mr. Bovender’s Additional
    Bonus (as defined in “Narrative Disclosure to Summary
    Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Employment Agreements”) has not been
    earned as of the termination date, the Committee will consider
    in good faith whether or not all or a portion of
    Mr. Bovender’s Additional Bonus will be included as
    part of Mr. Bovender’s Prorated Bonus. The same
    severance applies regardless of whether the termination was in
    connection with a change in control of the Company.
    Mr. Bovender would also be entitled to continued coverage
    under the Company’s group health plans for
    Mr. Bovender and his wife until age 65, reimbursement
    of any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred and such
    employee benefits, if any, as to which Mr. Bovender would
    be entitled under the Company’s employee benefit plans.

The Amended Employment Agreement also provides that, effective
    as of the expiration of the Employment Term or
    Mr. Bovender’s sooner voluntary termination for any
    reason (including by reason of death or disability, but other
    than for “good reason”), (i) neither
    Mr. Bovender nor the Company shall have any put or call
    rights with respect to Mr. Bovender’s New Options or
    stock acquired upon the exercise of any such options;
    (ii) Mr. Bovender’s “rollover” stock
    options will remain exercisable as if Mr. Bovender’s
    employment terminated by reason of “retirement” in
    accordance with the terms of the applicable equity plans and
    award agreements; (iii) the unvested New Options (including
    any issued 2x Time Options) held by Mr. Bovender that vest
    solely based on the passage of time will vest as if
    Mr. Bovender’s employment had continued through the
    next three anniversaries of their date of grant (it being
    understood that any 2x Time Options issued after
    Mr. Bovender’s termination or retirement shall also
    continue to vest through the remainder of the extended vesting
    period); (iv) the unvested New Options held by
    Mr. Bovender that are EBITDA performance options will
    remain outstanding and will vest, if at all, on the next four
    dates that they would have otherwise vested had
    Mr. Bovender’s employment continued, based upon the
    extent to which performance goals are met; (v) the unvested
    New Options held by Mr. Bovender that are “Investor
    Return” performance options will remain outstanding and
    will vest, if at all, on the dates that they would have
    otherwise vested had Mr. Bovender’s employment
    continued through the expiration of such options, based upon the
    extent to which performance goals are met; and
    (vi) Mr. Bovender’s New Options will remain
    exercisable until the second anniversary of the last date on
    which his EBITDA performance options are eligible to vest (which
    is December 31, 2014), except that
    (a) Mr. Bovender’s 2x Time Options will remain
    exercisable until the fifth anniversary of the last date on
    which his EBITDA performance options are eligible to vest (which
    is December 31, 2017), and
    (b) Mr. Bovender’s “Investor Return”
    performance options will remain exercisable until the expiration
    of such options.

If Mr. Bovender’s employment is terminated by the
    Company without “cause” or by Mr. Bovender for
    “good reason” (whether or not the termination was in
    connection with a

change-in-control),

Mr. Bovender would be entitled to receive the benefits
    described above and, subject to the delivery of a customary
    release and continued compliance with the noncompetition,
    nonsolicitation and confidentiality restrictions in the Amended
    Employment Agreement, an amount (if any) equal to
    Mr. Bovender’s base salary that would have been
    otherwise payable through the end of the Employment Term.

If Mr. Bovender’s employment is terminated by the
    Company for “cause,” Mr. Bovender shall be
    entitled to receive the amounts and benefits described in the
    first paragraph of this section, except that Mr. Bovender
    shall not be entitled to receive Mr. Bovender’s
    Prorated Bonus and shall not be entitled to any other benefits
    described above. Mr. Bovender’s vested New Options
    will, upon such event, remain exercisable until the first
    anniversary of the termination of Mr. Bovender’s
    employment.



Change
    in Control Benefits

Pursuant to the Stock Option Agreements governing the New
    Options granted in 2007 under the 2006 Plan, upon a Change in
    Control of the Company (as defined below), all unvested time
    vesting New Options (that have not otherwise terminated or
    become exercisable) shall become immediately exercisable.
    Performance options that vest subject to the achievement of
    EBITDA targets will become exercisable upon a Change in Control
    of the Company if: (i) prior to the date of the occurrence
    of such event, all EBITDA targets have been achieved for years
    ending prior to such date; (ii) on the date of the
    occurrence of such event, the Company’s actual cumulative
    total EBITDA earned in all years occurring after the performance
    option grant date, and ending on the date of the Change in
    Control, exceeds the cumulative total of all EBITDA targets in
    effect for those same years; or (iii) the Investor Return
    is at least

two-and-a-half

times the price paid to the shareholders in the Merger (or
    $127.50). For purposes of the vesting provision set forth in
    clause (ii) above, the EBITDA target for the year in which
    the Change in Control occurs shall be equitably adjusted by the
    Board of Directors in good faith in consultation with the chief
    executive officer (which adjustment shall take into account the
    time during such year at which the Change in Control occurs).
    Performance vesting options that vest based on the investment
    return to the Sponsors will only vest upon the occurrence of a
    Change in Control if, as a result of such event, the applicable
    Investor Return (i.e., at least two times the price paid to the
    shareholders in the Merger for half of these options and at
    least

two-and-one-half

times the price paid to the shareholders in the Merger for the
    other half of these options) is also achieved in such
    transaction (if not previously achieved). “Change in
    Control” means in one or more of a series of transactions
    (i) the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the
    assets of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent of the
    Company) to an Unaffiliated Person (as defined below);
    (ii) a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or
    reorganization of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent
    of the Company) with or into another Unaffiliated Person, or a
    transfer or sale of the voting stock of the Company (or any
    direct or indirect parent of the Company), an Investor, or any
    affiliate of any of the Investors to an Unaffiliated Person, in
    any such event that results in more than 50% of the common stock
    of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent of the Company)
    or the resulting company being held by an Unaffiliated Person;
    or (iii) a merger, consolidation, recapitalization or
    reorganization of the Company (or any direct or indirect parent
    of the Company) with or into another Unaffiliated Person, or a
    transfer or sale by the Company (or any direct or indirect
    parent of the Company), an Investor or any affiliate of any of
    the Investors, in any such event after which the Investors and
    their affiliates (x) collectively own less than 15% of the
    Common Stock of and (y) collectively have the ability to
    appoint less than 50% of the directors to the Board (or any
    resulting company after a merger). For purposes of this
    definition, the term “Unaffiliated Person” means a
    person or group who is not an Investor, an affiliate of any of
    the Investors or an entity in which any Investor holds, directly
    or indirectly, a majority of the economic interest in such
    entity.

Additional information regarding applicable payments under such
    agreements for the named executive officers is provided under
    “Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and
    Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment
    Agreements” and “Potential Payments Upon Termination
    or Change in Control.”

Recoupment
    of Compensation

While we do not presently have any formal policies or practices
    that provide for the recovery or adjustment of amounts
    previously paid to a named executive officer in the event the
    operating results on which the payment was based were restated
    or otherwise adjusted, in such event we would reserve the right
    to seek all appropriate remedies available under the law.

Tax and
    Accounting Implications

On April 29, 2008, we registered our common stock pursuant
    to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended; and the Company became subject to Section 162(m)
    of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “Code”)
    for fiscal year 2008 and beyond, so long as the Company’s
    stock remains registered with the SEC. The Committee considers
    the impact of Section 162(m) in the design of its
    compensation strategies. Under Section 162(m), compensation
    paid to executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 cannot be
    taken by us as a tax deduction unless the compensation qualifies
    as performance-based compensation.  We have determined, however,
    that we will not necessarily seek to limit executive
    compensation to amounts deductible under Section 162(m) if
    such limitation is not in the best interests of our
    stockholders. While considering the tax implications of its



compensation decisions, the Committee believes its primary focus
    should be to attract, retain and motivate executives and to
    align the executives’ interests with those of our
    stakeholders.

The Committee operates its compensation programs with the good
    faith intention of complying with Section 409A of the
    Internal Revenue Code. We account for stock based payments with
    respect to our long term equity incentive award programs in
    accordance with the requirements of SFAS 123(R).

Compensation
    Committee Report

The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the
    foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management.
    Based on our review and discussion with management, we have
    recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis be included in this annual report on

Form 10-K.

All amounts for 2007 are attributable to changes in value of the
    SERP benefits. Assumptions used to calculate these figures are
    provided under the table titled “Pension Benefits.”
    The changes in the SERP benefit value during 2007 were impacted
    mainly by: (i) the passage of time which reflects another
    year of pay and service, (ii) the discount rate changing
    from 5.75% to 6.00%, which resulted in a decrease in the value
    and (iii) the use of the named executive officers’
    actual elections compared to 2006 when benefits were valued
    assuming a 50% probability of electing a lump sum and a 50%
    probability of electing an annuity. All named executive officers



elected a lump sum payment at retirement, with the exception of
    Mr. Bovender, who elected an annuity. The impact of these
    events on the SERP benefit values was:

All amounts for 2006 are attributable to increases in value to
    the SERP benefits. In addition to the assumptions set forth
    under the table titled “Pension Benefits,” for the
    purposes of calculating the 2006 figures, benefits are valued
    assuming a 50% probability of electing a lump sum and a 50%
    probability of electing an annuity.
    Messrs. Bovender’s, Bracken’s Johnson’s and
    Hazen’s SERP benefit value increased in 2006 by $4,185,617,
    $1,272,074, $299,972, and $287,717, respectively, as a result of
    the passage of time. In 2006, their SERP benefit value further
    increased due to three special, one-time events: (i) the
    payments made under the 2006 Senior Officer PEP in November 2006
    described in footnote (4) to the Summary Compensation
    Table, which had the effect of increasing the named executive
    officers’ current final average earnings; (ii) the
    Merger constituted a change in control under the terms of the
    SERP, which triggered a decrease in the normal retirement age
    under the SERP from age 65 (or 62 with 10 years of
    service) to age 60; and (iii) the Committee approved
    the amendment of the SERP to include a lump sum payment
    provision and to revise certain actuarial factors. The impact of
    these events on the SERP benefit values was:

Personal use of corporate aircraft. In 2008,
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken and Johnson were allowed personal
    use of Company aircraft with an estimated incremental cost of
    $28,913, $15,233 and $4,546, respectively, to the Company.
    Mr. Hazen and Ms. Wallace did not have any personal
    travel on Company aircraft in 2008. We calculate the aggregate
    incremental cost of the personal use of Company aircraft based
    on a methodology that includes the average aggregate cost, on a
    per nautical mile basis, of variable expenses incurred in
    connection with personal plane usage, including trip-related
    maintenance, landing fees, fuel, crew hotels and meals, on-board
    catering, trip-related hangar and parking costs and other
    variable costs. Because our aircraft are used primarily for
    business travel, our incremental cost methodology does not
    include fixed costs of owning and operating aircraft that do not
    change based on usage. We grossed up the income attributed to
    Messrs. Bovender and Bracken with respect to certain trips
    on Company aircraft. The additional income attributed to them as
    a result of gross ups was $588 and $599, respectively. In
    addition, we will pay the expenses of our executives’
    spouses associated with travel to

and/or

attendance at business related events at which spouse attendance
    is appropriate. We paid approximately $107, $189 and $13,660 for
    travel

and/or

other
    expenses incurred by Messrs. Bovender’s,
    Bracken’s and Johnson’s wives, respectively, for such
    business related events, and additional income of $62, $109 and
    $4,912 was attributed to Messrs. Bovender, Bracken and
    Johnson, respectively, as a result of the gross up on such
    amounts.

    Company aircraft with an estimated incremental cost of $21,350
    and $26,895, respectively, to the Company, calculated as
    described above. Mr. Hazen and Ms. Wallace did not
    have any personal travel on Company’s aircraft in 2007. We
    grossed up the income attributed to Messrs. Bovender and
    Bracken with respect to certain trips on Company aircraft. The
    additional income attributed to them as a result of gross ups
    was $629 and $863, respectively. In addition, we will pay the
    travel expenses of our executives’ spouses associated with
    travel to business related events at which spouse attendance is
    appropriate. We paid approximately $342 for travel by
    Mr. Bracken’s wife on a commercial airline and related
    expenses for such an event, and additional income of $123 was
    attributed to Mr. Bracken as a result of the gross up on
    such amount.

2006 Amounts consist of:

•

The cash payment received as a result of the deemed purchase
    under the MSPP. Salary amounts withheld on behalf of the
    participants in the MSPP through the closing date of the Merger
    were deemed to have been used to purchase shares of our common
    stock under the terms of the MSPP, using the closing date of the
    Merger as the last date of the applicable offering period, and
    then converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to
    the number of shares deemed purchased under the MSPP multiplied
    by $51.00. Salary amounts were refunded to the participants, and
    they also received a cash payment equal to the difference
    between $51.00 and the deemed purchase price, multiplied by the
    number of shares the participant was deemed to have purchased.
    Messrs. Bovender, Bracken, Johnson and Hazen received cash
    payments of $20,860, $27,326, $24,157 and $25,379, respectively.

Non-equity incentive awards granted to each of the named
    executive officers pursuant to our

2008-2009

PEP for the 2008 fiscal year, as described in more detail under
    “Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Annual
    Incentive Compensation: PEP.” The amounts shown in the
    “Threshold” column reflect the threshold payment,
    which is 50% of the amount shown in the “Target”
    column. The amount shown in the “Maximum” column is
    200% of the target amount. These amounts are based on the
    individual’s salary and position as of the date the

2008-2009

Senior Officer PEP was approved by the Compensation Committee.
    Pursuant to the terms of the

2008-2009

PEP, awards have already been determined and will be paid out to
    the named executive officers at approximately 68.2% of each such
    officer’s respective target amount, with the exception of
    Mr. Hazen, whose award vested and will be paid out at
    approximately 67.4% of the target amount. Messrs. Bovender,
    Bracken, Johnson and Hazen and Ms. Wallace will receive
    $1,391,886, $694,370, $355,491, $350,807 and $314,992,
    respectively, under the

2008-2009

Senior Officer PEP for the 2008 fiscal year; such amounts are
    reflected in the “Non-Equity Incentive Plan
    Compensation” column of the Summary Compensation Table.

Narrative
    Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of
    Plan-Based Awards Table

Total
    Compensation

In 2008 and 2007, total direct compensation, as described in the
    Summary Compensation Table, consisted primarily of base salary,
    annual PEP awards payable in cash, and, in 2007, long term stock
    option grants designed to be one-time grants to cover at least
    five years of service. This mix was intended to reflect our
    philosophy that a significant portion of an executive’s
    compensation should be equity-linked

and/or

tied
    to our operating performance. In addition, we provided an
    opportunity for executives to participate in two supplemental
    retirement plans; however, effective January 1, 2008,
    participants in the SERP are no longer eligible for Restoration
    Plan contributions, although Restoration Plan accounts will
    continue to be maintained for such participants (for additional
    information concerning the Restoration Plan, see
    “Nonqualified Deferred Compensation”). In 2006, by
    contrast, total compensation, as described in the Summary
    Compensation Table, was significantly impacted by the Merger and
    related one time events.

Options

In January 2007, New Options to purchase common stock of the
    Company were granted under the 2006 Plan to members of
    management and key employees, including the named executive
    officers. The New Options were designed to be long term equity
    incentive awards, constituting a one-time stock option grant in
    lieu of annual equity grants. The New Options granted in 2007
    have a ten year term and are structured so that


/


are time vested options (vesting in five equal installments on
    the first five anniversaries of the grant date),


/


are EBITDA-based performance vested options and


/


are performance options that vest based on investment return to
    the Sponsors. The terms of the New Options granted in 2007 are
    described in greater detail under “Compensation Discussion
    and Analysis — Long Term Equity Incentive Awards:
    Options.” Compensation expense associated with the New
    Option awards was recognized in 2008 and 2007 in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) and is included under the “Option
    Awards” column of the Summary Compensation Table.



As a result of the Merger, all unvested awards under the 2005
    Plan (and all predecessor equity incentive plans) vested in
    November 2006. Generally, all outstanding options under the 2005
    Plan (and any predecessor plans) were cancelled and converted
    into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the number of
    shares of common stock underlying the option multiplied by the
    amount by which the Merger consideration of $51.00 per share
    exceeded the exercise price for the options (without interest
    and less any applicable withholding taxes). However, certain
    members of management, including the named executive officers,
    were given the opportunity to convert options held by them prior
    to consummation of the Merger into options to purchase shares of
    common stock of the surviving corporation (“Rollover
    Options”). Immediately after the consummation of the
    Merger, all Rollover Options (other than those with an exercise
    price below $12.75) were adjusted so that they retained the same
    “spread value” (as defined below) as immediately prior
    to the Merger, but the new per share exercise price for all
    Rollover Options would be $12.75. The term “spread
    value” means the difference between (x) the aggregate
    fair market value of the common stock (determined using the
    Merger consideration of $51.00 per share) subject to the
    outstanding options held by the participant immediately prior to
    the Merger that became Rollover Options, and (y) the
    aggregate exercise price of those options. All previously
    unrecognized compensation expense associated with the Rollover
    Options was recognized in 2006; therefore, we did not record any
    compensation expense related to the Rollover Options in 2008 or
    2007. New Options and Rollover Options held by the named
    executive officers are described in the Outstanding Equity
    Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table.

Employment
    Agreements

In connection with the Merger, on November 16, 2006,
    Hercules Holding entered into substantially similar employment
    agreements with each of the named executive officers and certain
    other executives, which agreements were shortly thereafter
    assumed by the Company and which agreements govern the terms of
    each executive’s employment. However, in light of
    Mr. Bovender’s retirement from the position of Chief
    Executive Officer, effective December 31, 2008, and
    continuing service to the Company as Chairman until
    December 15, 2009, the Company entered into an Amended and
    Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Bovender, effective
    December 31, 2008, the terms of which are described below.
    The Company also entered into an amendment to
    Mr. Bracken’s employment agreement, effective
    January 1, 2009, to reflect his appointment to the position
    of Chief Executive Officer and President.

Executive
    Employment Agreements (Other than the
    Chairman’s)

The term of employment under each of these agreements is
    indefinite, and they are terminable by either party at any time;
    provided that an executive must give no less than 90 days
    notice prior to a resignation.

Each employment agreement sets forth the executive’s annual
    base salary, which will be subject to discretionary annual
    increases upon review by the Board of Directors, and states that
    the executive will be eligible to earn an annual bonus as a
    percentage of salary with respect to each fiscal year, based
    upon the extent to which annual performance targets established
    by the Board of Directors are achieved. The employment
    agreements committed us to provide each executive with annual
    bonus opportunities in 2008 that were consistent with those
    applicable to the 2007 fiscal year, unless doing so would be
    adverse to our interests or the interests of our shareholders,
    and for later fiscal years, the agreements provide that the
    Board of Directors will set bonus opportunities in consultation
    with our Chief Executive Officer. With respect to the 2008 and
    2007 fiscal years, each executive was eligible to earn under the

2008-2009

PEP and the

2008-2007

PEP, respectively, (i) a target bonus, if performance
    targets were met; (ii) a specified percentage of the target
    bonus, if “threshold” levels of performance were
    achieved but performance targets were not met; or (iii) a
    multiple of the target bonus if “maximum” performance
    goals were achieved, with the annual bonus amount being
    interpolated, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors,
    for performance results that exceeded “threshold”
    levels but do not meet or exceed “maximum” levels. The
    annual bonus opportunities for 2008 were set forth in the

2008-2009

PEP, as described in more detail under “Compensation
    Discussion and Analysis — Annual Incentive
    Compensation: PEP.” As described above, awards under the
    2008 PEP have already been determined and will be paid out to
    the named executive officers, at approximately 68.2% of each
    such officer’s respective target amount, with the exception
    of Mr. Hazen, whose award vested and will be paid out at
    approximately 67.4% of the target amount. As described above,
    awards under the 2007 PEP were paid out to the named executive
    officers, at the maximum level of 200% of their respective
    target amounts, with the exception



of Mr. Hazen, whose award was paid out at 175.6% of his
    target amount.  Each employment agreement also sets forth the
    number of options that the executive received pursuant to the
    2006 Plan as a percentage of the total equity initially made
    available for grants pursuant to the 2006 Plan. Such option
    awards, the New Options, were made January 30, 2007 and are
    described above.

Pursuant to each employment agreement, if an executive’s
    employment terminates due to death or disability, the executive
    would be entitled to receive (i) any base salary and any
    bonus that is earned and unpaid through the date of termination;
    (ii) reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses
    properly incurred by the executive; (iii) such employee
    benefits, if any, as to which the executive may be entitled
    under our employee benefit plans (the payments and benefits
    described in (i) through (iii) being “accrued
    rights”); and (iv) a pro rata portion of any annual
    bonus that the executive would have been entitled to receive
    pursuant to the employment agreement based upon our actual
    results for the year of termination (with such proration based
    on the percentage of the fiscal year that shall have elapsed
    through the date of termination of employment, payable to the
    executive when the annual bonus would have been otherwise
    payable (the “pro rata bonus”)).

If an executive’s employment is terminated by us without
    “cause” (as defined below) or by the executive for
    “good reason” (as defined below) (each a
    “qualifying termination”), the executive would be
    (i) entitled to the accrued rights; (ii) subject to
    compliance with certain confidentiality, non-competition and
    non-solicitation covenants contained in his or her employment
    agreement and execution of a general release of claims on behalf
    of the Company, an amount equal to the product of (x) two
    (three in the case of Richard M. Bracken and R. Milton Johnson)
    and (y) the sum of (A) the executive’s base
    salary and (B) annual bonus paid or payable in respect of
    the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which
    termination occurs, payable over a two-year period;
    (iii) entitled to the pro rata bonus; and
    (iv) entitled to continued coverage under our group health
    plans during the period over which the cash severance described
    in clause (ii) is paid. The executive’s vested New
    Options would also remain exercisable until the first
    anniversary of the termination of the executive’s
    employment. However, in lieu of receiving the payments and
    benefits described in (ii), (iii) and (iv) immediately
    above, the executive may instead elect to have his or her
    covenants not to compete waived by us. The same severance
    applies regardless of whether the termination was in connection
    with a change in control of the Company.

“Cause” is defined as an executive’s
    (i) willful and continued failure to perform his material
    duties to the Company which continues beyond 10 business days
    after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered;
    (ii) willful or intentional engagement in material
    misconduct that causes material and demonstrable injury,
    monetarily or otherwise, to the Company or the Sponsors;
    (iii) conviction of, or a plea of

nolo contendere

to, a crime constituting a felony, or a misdemeanor for
    which a sentence of more than six months’ imprisonment is
    imposed; or (iv) willful and material breach of his
    covenants under the employment agreement which continues beyond
    the designated cure period or of the agreements relating to the
    new equity. “Good Reason” is defined as (i) a
    reduction in the executive’s base salary (other than a
    general reduction that affects all similarly situated employees
    in substantially the same proportions which is implemented by
    the Board in good faith after consultation with the chief
    executive officer and chief operating officer, a reduction in
    the executive’s annual incentive compensation opportunity,
    or the reduction of benefits payable to the executive under the
    SERP; (ii) a substantial diminution in the executive’s
    title, duties and responsibilities; or (iii) a transfer of
    the executive’s primary workplace to a location that is
    more than 20 miles from his or her current workplace (other
    than, in the case of (i) and (ii), any isolated,
    insubstantial and inadvertent failure that is not in bad faith
    and is cured within 10 business days after the executive’s
    written notice to the Company).

In the event of an executive’s termination of employment
    that is not a qualifying termination or a termination due to
    death or disability, he or she will only be entitled to the
    “accrued rights” (as defined above).

In each of the employment agreements with the named executive
    officers, we also commit to grant, among the named executive
    officers and certain other executives, 10% of the options
    initially authorized for grant under the 2006 Plan at some time
    before November 17, 2011 (but with a good faith commitment
    to do so before a “change in control” (as defined in
    the 2006 Plan and set forth above) or a “public
    offering” (as defined in the 2006 Plan) and before the time
    when our Board of Directors reasonably believes that the fair
    market value of our common stock is likely to exceed the
    equivalent of $102.00 per share) at an exercise price per share
    that is the equivalent of $102.00 per share (“2x Time
    Options”). A percentage of these options will be vested at
    the time of the grant, such percentage



corresponding to the elapsed percentage of the period measured
    between November 17, 2006 and November 17, 2011. When
    granted, these options will be allocated among the recipients by
    our Board of Directors in consultation with our chief executive
    officer based upon the perceived contributions of each recipient
    since November 17, 2006. The terms of the 2x Time Options
    will otherwise be consistent with other time vesting options
    granted under the 2006 Plan. Additionally, pursuant to the
    employment agreements, we agree to indemnify each executive
    against any adverse tax consequences (including, without
    limitation, under Section 409A and 4999 of the Internal
    Revenue Code), if any, that result from the adjustment by us of
    stock options held by the executive in connection with Merger or
    the future payment of any extraordinary cash dividends.

Additional information with respect to potential payments to the
    named executive officers pursuant to their employment agreements
    and the 2006 Plan is contained in “Potential Payments Upon
    Termination or Change in Control.”

Pension
    Benefits

Our SERP is intended to qualify as a “top-hat” plan
    designed to benefit a select group of management or highly
    compensated employees. There are no other defined benefit plans
    that provide for payments or benefits to any of the named
    executive officers. Information about benefits provided by the
    SERP is as follows:

Mr. Bovender is eligible for normal retirement.
    Mr. Bracken and Ms. Wallace are eligible for early
    retirement. The remaining named executive officers have not
    satisfied the eligibility requirements for normal or early
    retirement. All of the named executive officers are 100% vested
    in their accrued SERP benefit.

Plan
    Provisions

In the event the employee’s “accrued benefits under
    the Company’s Plans” (computed using “actuarial
    factors”) are insufficient to provide the “life
    annuity amount,” the SERP will provide a benefit equal to
    the amount of the shortfall. Benefits can be paid in the form of
    an annuity or a lump sum. The lump sum is calculated by
    converting the annuity benefit using the “actuarial
    factors.” All benefits with a present value not exceeding
    one million dollars are paid as a lump sum regardless of the
    election made.

Normal retirement eligibility requires attainment of age 60
    for employees who were participants at the time of the change in
    control which occurred as a result of the Merger, including all
    of the named executive officers. Early retirement eligibility
    requires age 55 with 20 or more years of service. The
    service requirement for early retirement is waived for employees
    participating in the SERP at the time of its inception in 2001,
    including all of the named executive officers. The “life
    annuity amount” payable to a participant who takes early
    retirement is reduced by three percent for each full year or
    portion thereof that the participant retires prior to normal
    retirement age.

The “life annuity amount” is the annual benefit
    payable as a life annuity to a participant upon normal
    retirement. It is equal to the participant’s “accrual
    rate” multiplied by the product of the participant’s
    “years of service” times the participant’s
    “pay average.” The SERP benefit for each year equals
    the life annuity amount less the annual life annuity amount
    produced by the employee’s “accrued benefit under the
    Company’s Plans.”

The “accrual rate” is a percentage assigned to each
    participant, and is either 2.2% or 2.4%. All of the named
    executive officers are assigned a percentage of 2.4%.

A participant is credited with a “year of service” for
    each calendar year that the participant performs
    1,000 hours of service for HCA or one of our subsidiaries,
    or for each year the participant is otherwise credited by us,
    subject to a maximum credit of 25 years of service.

A participant’s “pay average” is an amount equal
    to one-fifth of the sum of the compensation during the period of
    60 consecutive months for which total compensation is greatest
    within the 120 consecutive month period immediately preceding
    the participant’s retirement. For purposes of this
    calculation, the participant’s compensation includes base
    compensation, payments under the PEP, and bonuses paid prior to
    the establishment of the PEP.

The “accrued benefits under the Company’s Plans”
    for an employee equals the sum of the employer-funded benefits
    accrued under the HCA Retirement Plan, the HCA 401(k) Plan and
    any other tax-qualified plan maintained by us or one of our
    subsidiaries, the income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the
    participant under any of these plans, the account credit and the
    income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the participant under
    the Restoration Plan and any other nonqualified retirement plans
    sponsored by us or one of our subsidiaries.

The “actuarial factors” include (a) interest at
    the long term Applicable Federal Rate under Section 1274(d)
    of the Code or any successor thereto as of the first day of
    November preceding the plan year in or for which a benefit



amount is calculated, and (b) mortality based on the
    prevailing commissioner’s standard table (as described in
    Code section 807(d)(5)(A)) used in determining reserves for
    group annuity contracts.

Credited service does not include any amount other than service
    with us or one of our subsidiaries.

Assumptions

The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit is based on a
    measurement date of December 31, 2008.

The assumption is made that there is no probability of
    pre-retirement death or termination. Retirement age is assumed
    to be the Normal Retirement Age as defined in the SERP for all
    named executive officers, as adjusted by the provisions relating
    to change in control, or age 60. Age 60 also
    represents the earliest date the named executive officers are
    eligible to receive an unreduced benefit.

All other assumptions used in the calculations are the same as
    those used for the valuation of the plan liabilities in this
    annual report.

Supplemental
    Information

In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits his rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any benefits already paid. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.

Nonqualified
    Deferred Compensation

Amounts shown in the table are attributable to the HCA
    Restoration Plan, an unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution
    plan designed to restore benefits under the HCA Retirement Plan
    based on compensation in excess of the Code
    Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit ($230,000 in 2008).

Plan
    Provisions

Until 2008, hypothetical accounts for each participant were
    credited each year with a contribution designed to restore the
    HCA Retirement Plan based on compensation in excess of the Code
    Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit ($230,000 in 2008),
    based on years of service. Effective January 1, 2008,
    participants in the SERP are no longer eligible for Restoration
    Plan contributions. However, the hypothetical accounts as of
    January 1, 2008 will



continue to be maintained and will be increased or decreased
    with investment earnings based on the actual investment return.

No employee deferrals are allowed under this or any other
    nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

Eligible employees make a one time election prior to
    participation (or prior to December 31, 2006, if earlier)
    regarding the form of distribution of the benefit. Participants
    choose between a lump sum and five or ten installments.
    Distributions are paid (or begin) during the July following the
    year of termination of employment or retirement. All balances
    not exceeding $500,000 are automatically paid as a lump sum. If
    no election is made, the benefit is paid in a lump sum.

Supplemental
    Information

In the event a participant renders service to another health
    care organization within five years following retirement or
    termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any
    further payment, and must repay any payments already made. This
    non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee
    with respect to the named executive officers.

Potential
    Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

The following tables show the estimated amount of potential cash
    severance payable to each of the named executive officers, as
    well as the estimated value of continuing benefits, based on
    compensation and benefit levels in effect on December 31,
    2008, assuming the executive’s employment terminates or the
    Company undergoes a Change in Control (as defined in the 2006
    Plan and set forth above under “Narrative to Summary
    Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards
    Table — Options”) effective December 31,
    2008. Due to the numerous factors involved in estimating these
    amounts, the actual value of benefits and amounts to be paid can
    only be determined upon an executive’s termination of
    employment.

Director
    Compensation

During the year ended December 31, 2008, none of our
    directors received compensation for their service as a member of
    our Board. Our directors are reimbursed for any expenses
    incurred in connection with their service.

Compensation
    Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

During 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
    Directors was composed of Michael W. Michelson, George A. Bitar,
    John P. Connaughton and Thomas F. Frist, Jr., M.D.
    Dr. Frist served as an executive officer and Chairman of
    our Board of Directors from January 2001 to January 2002. From
    July 1997 to January 2001, Dr. Frist served as our Chairman
    and Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Frist served as Vice
    Chairman of the Board of Directors from April 1995 to July 1997
    and as Chairman from February 1994 to April 1995. He was
    Chairman,



Chief Executive Officer and President of HCA-Hospital
    Corporation of America from 1988 to February 1994.
    Dr. Frist, who retired from our Board of Directors
    effective January 1, 2009, is the father of Thomas F.
    Frist, III and William R. Frist, who currently serve as
    directors. (Thomas F. Frist, III has been a director since
    November 2006, and William R. Frist has been a director since
    January 2009.) None of the other members of the Compensation
    Committee have at any time been an officer or employee of HCA or
    any of its subsidiaries. Each member of the Compensation
    Committee is also a manager of Hercules Holding, and the Amended
    and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Hercules
    Holding requires that the members of Hercules Holding take all
    necessary action to ensure that the persons who serves as
    managers of Hercules Holding also serve on our Board of
    Directors. Messrs. Michelson, Bitar and Connaughton are
    affiliated with KKR, MLGPE (an affiliate of Bank of America
    Corporation), and Bain, respectively, each of which is a party
    to the sponsor management agreement with us. Dr. Frist and
    certain other members of the Frist family, are also party to the
    sponsor management agreement with us. The Amended and Restated
    Limited Liability Company Agreement of Hercules Holding, the
    sponsor management agreement and certain transactions with
    affiliates of MLGPE and KKR are described in greater detail in
    Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions.”

Item 12.

Security
    Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and
    Related Stockholder Matters

The following table sets forth information regarding the
    beneficial ownership of our common stock as of February 25,
    2009 for:

•

each person who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5%
    of the outstanding shares of our common stock;

•

each of our directors;

•

each of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation
    Table; and

•

all of our directors and executive officers as a group.



The percentages of shares outstanding provided in the tables are
    based on 94,371,407 shares of our common stock, par value
    $0.01 per share, outstanding as of February 25, 2009.
    Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules
    of the SEC and generally includes voting or investment power
    with respect to securities. Shares issuable upon the exercise of
    options that are exercisable within 60 days of
    February 25, 2009 are considered outstanding for the
    purpose of calculating the percentage of outstanding shares of
    our common stock held by the individual, but not for the purpose
    of calculating the percentage of outstanding shares held by any
    other individual. The address of each of our directors and

Item 13.

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions

In accordance with its charter, our Audit and Compliance
    Committee reviews and approves all material related party
    transactions. Prior to its approval of any material related
    party transaction, the Audit and Compliance Committee will
    discuss the proposed transaction with management and our
    independent auditor. In addition, our Code of Conduct requires
    that all of our employees, including our executive officers,
    remain free of conflicts of interest in the performance of their
    responsibilities to the Company. An executive officer who wishes
    to enter into a transaction in which their interests might
    conflict with ours must first receive the approval of the Audit
    and Compliance Committee. The Amended and Restated Limited
    Liability Company Agreement of Hercules Holding II, LLC
    generally requires that an Investor must obtain the prior
    written consent of each other Investor before it or any of its
    affiliates (including our directors) enter into any transaction
    with us.

Stockholder
    Agreements

On January 30, 2007, our Board of Directors awarded to
    members of management and certain key employees New Options to
    purchase shares of our common stock (New Options together with
    the Rollover Options, “Options”) pursuant to the 2006
    Plan. Our Compensation Committee approved additional option
    awards periodically throughout the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007 to members of management and certain key employees
    in cases of promotions, significant contributions to the Company
    and new hires. In connection with their option awards, the
    participants under the 2006 Plan were required to enter into a
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement, a Sale Participation
    Agreement, and an Option Agreement with respect to the New
    Options. Below are brief summaries of the principal terms of the
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement and the Sale
    Participation Agreement each of which are qualified in their
    entirety by reference to the agreements themselves, forms of
    which were filed as Exhibits 10.12 and 10.13, respectively,
    to our annual report on

Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. The terms of
    the Option Agreement with respect to New Options and the 2006
    Plan are



described in more detail in Item 11, “Executive
    Compensation — Compensation Discussion and
    Analysis — Long Term Equity Incentive Awards.”

Management Stockholder’s Agreement.

The
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement imposes significant
    restrictions on transfers of shares of our common stock.
    Generally, shares will be nontransferable by any means at any
    time prior to the earlier of a “Change in Control” (as
    defined in the Management Stockholder’s Agreement) or the
    fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Merger, except
    (i) sales pursuant to an effective registration statement
    under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
    “Securities Act”) filed by the Company in accordance
    with the Management Stockholder’s Agreement, (ii) a
    sale pursuant to the Sale Participation Agreement (described
    below), (iii) a sale to certain “Permitted
    Transferees” (as defined in the Management
    Stockholder’s Agreement), or (iv) as otherwise
    permitted by our Board of Directors or pursuant to a waiver of
    the restrictions on transfers given by unanimous agreement of
    the Sponsors. On and after such fifth anniversary through the
    earlier of a Change in Control or the eighth anniversary of the
    closing date of the Merger, a management stockholder will be
    able to transfer shares of our common stock, but only to the
    extent that, on a cumulative basis, the management stockholders
    in the aggregate do not transfer a greater percentage of their
    equity than the percentage of equity sold or otherwise disposed
    of by the Sponsors.

In the event that a management stockholder wishes to sell their
    stock at any time following the fifth anniversary of the closing
    date of the Merger but prior to an initial public offering of
    our common stock, the Management Stockholder’s Agreement
    provides the Company with a right of first offer on those shares
    upon the same terms and conditions pursuant to which the
    management stockholder would sell them to a third party. In the
    event that a registration statement is filed with respect to our
    common stock in the future, the Management Stockholder’s
    Agreement prohibits management stockholders from selling shares
    not included in the registration statement from the time of
    receipt of notice until 180 days (in the case of an initial
    public offering) or 90 days (in the case of any other
    public offering) of the date of the registration statement. The
    Management Stockholder’s Agreement also provides for the
    management stockholder’s ability to cause us to repurchase
    their outstanding stock and options in the event of the
    management stockholder’s death or disability, and for our
    ability to cause the management stockholder to sell their stock
    or options back to the Company upon certain termination events.

The Management Stockholder’s Agreement provides that, in
    the event we propose to sell shares to the Sponsors, certain
    members of senior management, including the executive officers
    (the “Senior Management Stockholders”) have a
    preemptive right to purchase shares in the offering. The maximum
    shares a Senior Management Stockholder may purchase is a
    proportionate number of the shares offered to the percentage of
    shares owned by the Senior Management Stockholder prior to the
    offering. Additionally, following the initial public offering of
    our common stock, the Senior Management Stockholders will have
    limited “piggyback” registration rights with respect
    to their shares of common stock. The maximum number of shares of
    Common Stock which a Senior Management Stockholder may register
    is generally proportionate with the percentage of common stock
    being sold by the Sponsors (relative to their holdings thereof).

Sale Participation Agreement.

The Sale
    Participation Agreement grants the Senior Management
    Stockholders the right to participate in any private direct or
    indirect sale of shares of common stock by the Sponsors (such
    right being referred to herein as the “Tag-Along
    Right”), and requires all management stockholders to
    participate in any such private sale if so elected by the
    Sponsors in the event that the Sponsors are proposing to sell at
    least 50% of the outstanding common stock held by the Sponsors,
    whether directly or through their interests in Hercules Holding
    (such right being referred to herein as the “Drag-Along
    Right”). The number of shares of common stock which would

Amended
    and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Hercules
    Holding II, LLC

The Investors and certain other investment funds who agreed to
    co-invest with them through a vehicle jointly controlled by the
    Investors to provide equity financing for the Recapitalization
    entered into a limited liability company operating agreement in
    respect of Hercules Holding (the “LLC Agreement”). The
    LLC Agreement contains agreements among the parties with respect
    to the election of our directors, restrictions on the issuance
    or transfer of interests in us, including a right of first
    offer, tag-along rights and drag-along rights, and other
    corporate governance provisions (including the right to approve
    various corporate actions).

Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, Hercules Holding and its members
    are required to take necessary action to ensure that each
    manager on the board of Hercules Holding also serves on our
    Board of Directors. Each of the Sponsors has the right to
    appoint three managers to Hercules Holding’s board, the
    Frist family has the right to appoint two managers to the board,
    and the remaining two managers on the board are to come from our
    management team (currently Messrs. Bovender and Bracken).
    The rights of the Sponsors and the Frist family to designate
    managers are subject to their ownership percentages in Hercules
    Holding remaining above a specified percentage of the
    outstanding ownership interests in Hercules Holding.

The LLC Agreement also requires that, in addition to a majority
    of the total number of managers being present to constitute a
    quorum for the transaction of business at any board or committee
    meeting, at least one manager designated by each of the
    Investors must be present, unless waived by that Investor. The
    LLC Agreement further provides that, for so long as at least two
    Sponsors are entitled to designate managers to Hercules
    Holding’s board, at least one manager from each of two
    Sponsors must consent to any board or committee action in order
    for it to be valid. The LLC Agreement requires that our
    organizational and governing documents contain provisions
    similar to those described in this paragraph.

Registration
    Rights Agreement

Hercules Holding and the Investors entered into a registration
    rights agreement with us upon completion of the
    Recapitalization. Pursuant to this agreement, the Investors can
    cause us to register shares of our common stock held by Hercules
    Holding under the Securities Act and, if requested, to maintain
    a shelf registration statement effective with respect to such
    shares. The Investors are also entitled to participate on a pro
    rata basis in any registration of our common stock under the
    Securities Act that we may undertake.

Sponsor
    Management Agreement

In connection with the Merger, we entered into a management
    agreement with affiliates of each of the Sponsors and certain
    members of the Frist family, including Thomas F.
    Frist, Jr., M.D., Thomas F. Frist, III and
    William R. Frist, pursuant to which such entities or their
    affiliates will provide management services to us. Pursuant to
    the agreement, in 2008, we paid management fees of
    $15 million and reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses incurred
    in connection with the provision of services pursuant to the
    agreement. The agreement provides that the aggregate annual
    management fee, initially set at $15 million, increases
    annually beginning in 2008 at a rate equal to the percentage
    increase of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Management
    Agreement) in the applicable year compared to the preceding
    year. The agreement also provides that we will pay a 1% fee in
    connection with certain subsequent financing, acquisition,
    disposition and change of control transactions, as well as a
    termination fee based on the net present value of future payment
    obligations under the management agreement, in the event of an
    initial public offering or under certain other circumstances. No
    fees were paid under either of these provisions in 2008. The
    agreement includes customary exculpation and indemnification
    provisions in favor of the Sponsors and their affiliates and the
    Frists.

Other
    Relationships

In 2008, we paid approximately $25.5 million to HCP, Inc.
    (NYSE: HCP), representing the aggregate annual lease payments
    for certain medical office buildings leased by the Company.

    Board of Directors in 2008) and

brother-in-law

of Thomas F. Frist, III, and William R. Frist, who are
    members of our Board of Directors.

    secured cash flow credit facility and our asset-based revolving
    credit facility. Affiliates of Bank of America indirectly own
    approximately 25.8% of the shares of our company. We have
    engaged Banc of America Securities LLC, an affiliate of Bank of
    America, as arranger and documentation agent in connection with
    certain amendments to our senior secured cash flow credit
    facility and our senior secured asset-based revolving credit
    facility. Under that engagement, upon such amendments becoming
    effective, we paid Banc of America Securities LLC aggregate fees
    of $6 million relating to the amendments to our senior
    secured credit facilities.

In addition, Banc of America Securities LLC acted as joint
    book-running manager and a representative of the initial
    purchasers of the


/


% Senior
    Secured Notes due 2017 (the “2009 Second Lien Notes”)
    that we issued on February 19, 2009. The proceeds of the
    issuance of the notes were used to repay indebtedness under the
    senior secured credit facilities, and Bank of America received
    its pro rata portion of such repayment. In addition, Banc of
    America Securities LLC received placement fees of $1,401,034 in
    connection with the issuance of the 2009 Second Lien Notes.

    the 2009 Second Lien Notes, is an affiliate of KKR, whose
    affiliates own approximately 24.8% of the shares of our company,
    and received placement fees of $191,050 in connection with the
    issuance of the 2009 Second Lien Notes.

Though not formally considered by our Board because our common
    stock is not currently listed or traded on any national
    securities exchange, based upon the listing standards of the
    NYSE, the national securities exchange upon which our common
    stock was traded prior to the Merger, we do not believe that any
    of our directors would be considered “independent”
    because of their relationships with certain affiliates of the
    funds and other entities which hold significant interests in
    Hercules Holding, which, as of December 31, 2008, owned
    97.3% of our outstanding common stock, and other relationships
    with us. See Item 13, “Certain Relationships and
    Related Transactions.” Accordingly, we do not believe that
    any of Messrs. Birosak, Frist, Gordon or Momtazee, the
    members of our Audit and Compliance committee, would meet the
    independence requirements or

Rule 10A-1

of the Exchange Act or the NYSE’s audit committee
    independence requirements, or that Messrs. Bitar,
    Connaughton or Michelson, the members of our Compensation
    Committee, would meet the NYSE’s independence requirements.
    We do not have a nominating/corporate governance committee, or a
    committee that serves a similar purpose.

Item 14.

Principal
    Accountant Fees and Services

The Audit and Compliance Committee has appointed
    Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public
    accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting
    firm will audit our consolidated financial statements for 2009
    and the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009.

Audit Fees.

The aggregate audit fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered
    for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements,
    for the reviews of the condensed consolidated financial
    statements included in our quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

for the audit of the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting, under the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and services that are normally
    provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in
    connection with statutory and regulatory filings totaled
    $8.5 million for 2008 and $8.9 million for 2007.

Audit-Related Fees.

The aggregate fees billed
    by Ernst & Young LLP for assurance and related
    services not described above under “Audit Fees” were
    $1.4 million for 2008 and $1.3 million for 2007.
    Audit-related services principally include audits of certain of
    our subsidiaries and benefit plans.

Tax Fees.

The aggregate fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered
    for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning were
    $1.9 million for 2008 and $2.2 million for 2007.

All Other Fees.

The aggregate fees billed by
    Ernst & Young LLP for products or services other than
    those described above were $92,000 for 2008 and $749,000 for
    2007.

The Board of Directors has adopted an Audit and Compliance
    Committee Charter which, among other things, requires the Audit
    and Compliance Committee to preapprove all audit and permitted
    nonaudit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be
    performed for us by our independent registered public accounting
    firm, subject to the ability to delegate authority to a
    subcommittee for certain preapprovals.

All services performed for us by Ernst & Young LLP in
    2008 were preapproved by the Audit and Compliance Committee. The
    Audit and Compliance Committee concluded that the provision of
    audit-related services, tax services and other services by
    Ernst & Young LLP was compatible with the maintenance
    of the firm’s independence in the conduct of its auditing
    functions.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ (deficit)
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2008. These financial statements are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
    statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31, 2008 and
    2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008, in conformity with U.S. generally
    accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HCA
    Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated March 3, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Merger,
    Recapitalization and Reporting Entity

On November 17, 2006 HCA Inc. (the “Company”)
    completed its merger (the “Merger”) with Hercules
    Acquisition Corporation, pursuant to which the Company was
    acquired by Hercules Holding II, LLC, a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group including
    affiliates of Bain Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis
    Roberts & Co., Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity
    (each a “Sponsor”) and affiliates of HCA founder,
    Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., (the “Frist Entities,”
    and together with the Sponsors, the “Investors”), and
    by members of management and certain other investors. The
    Merger, the financing transactions related to the Merger and
    other related transactions are collectively referred to in this
    annual report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger
    was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial
    statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our
    assets and liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees and certain other
    investors. On April 29, 2008, we registered our common
    stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, thus subjecting us to the reporting requirements of
    Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our
    common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange.

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate
    hospitals and related health care entities. The term
    “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
    of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
    subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2008, these
    affiliates owned and operated 158 hospitals, 97 freestanding
    surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary
    services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in joint ventures
    that own and operate eight hospitals and eight freestanding
    surgery centers, which are accounted for using the equity
    method. The Company’s facilities are located in
    20 states and England. The terms “HCA,”
    “Company,” “we,” “our” or
    “us,” as used in this annual report on

Form 10-K,

refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise stated or
    indicated by context.

Basis of
    Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
    and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
    “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting
    interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements
    include entities in which we absorb a majority of the
    entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the
    entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
    ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
    entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities that we do not control, but
    in which we have a substantial ownership interest and can
    exercise significant influence, are accounted for using the
    equity method.

We have completed various acquisitions and joint venture
    transactions. The accounts of these entities have been included
    in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent
    to our acquisition of controlling interests. The majority of our
    expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could
    be classified as general and administrative include our
    corporate office costs, which were $174 million,
    $169 million and $187 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
    are recorded based upon established billing rates less
    allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
    during the period the health care services are provided, based
    upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
    payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies
    (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health
    plans,

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

commercial insurance companies and employers. Estimates of
    contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based
    upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual
    agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed care agreements
    are generally based upon predetermined rates per diagnosis, per
    diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
    there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded
    estimates will change by a material amount. The estimated
    reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost
    reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are
    determined (in relation to certain government programs,
    primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the
    “cost report” filing and settlement process). The
    adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
    in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports
    filed during the respective year were $32 million,
    $47 million and $55 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement
    amounts, which resulted in net increases to revenues, related
    primarily to cost reports filed during previous years were
    $35 million, $83 million and $62 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, us to provide services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts
    determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
    revenues. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care,
    who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level,
    are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is
    established by the federal government and is based on income and
    family size. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do
    not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
    similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
    qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance
    subsidiary’s cash equivalent investments in excess of the
    amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims
    during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash
    equivalents as these funds are not available for general
    corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
    approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of
    available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when
    presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks
    totaling $382 million and $370 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, have been
    included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are
    funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts
    Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state
    agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed
    care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and
    patients. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007
    and 2006, 23%, 24% and 25%, respectively, of our revenues
    related to patients participating in the fee-for-service
    Medicare program and 6%, 5% and 5%, respectively, of our
    revenues related to patients participating in managed Medicare
    programs. We recognize that revenues and receivables from
    government agencies are significant to our operations, but do
    not believe there are significant credit risks associated with
    these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other
    significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer
    that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the
    collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
    means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
    off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for
    doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The
    amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical and expected net
    collections, business and economic conditions, trends in
    federal, state and private employer health care coverage and
    other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts
    and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to
    “uninsured” amounts (including copayment and
    deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage)
    due directly from patients. Accounts are written off when all
    reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
    performed. We consider the return of an account from the
    secondary external collection agency to be the culmination of
    our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for
    writing off the account balance (prior to 2007, we wrote
    accounts off upon their return from the primary external
    agency). Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and
    the writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the
    patient accounting system. Management relies on the results of
    detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and recoveries at
    facilities that represent a majority of our revenues and
    accounts receivable (the “hindsight analysis”) as a
    primary source of information to utilize in estimating the
    collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
    hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
    accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, our allowance for doubtful
    accounts represented approximately 93% and 89%, respectively, of
    the $5.838 billion and $4.825 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net
    of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated
    (“pending Medicaid accounts”). Revenue days in
    accounts receivable were 49 days, 53 days and
    53 days at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Adverse changes in general economic conditions,
    patient accounting service center operations, payer mix or
    trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage
    could affect our collection of accounts receivable, cash flows
    and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
    was $1.412 billion in 2008, $1.421 billion in 2007,
    and $1.384 billion in 2006. Buildings and improvements are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
    10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
    generally from four to 10 years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the
    respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
    deferred loan costs at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was
    $650 million and $652 million, respectively, and
    accumulated amortization was $192 million and
    $113 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred loan
    costs is included in interest expense and was $79 million,
    $78 million and $18 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

ACCOUNTING

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles (Continued)

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the
    carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
    identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) expected to
    be held and used, might be impaired, we prepare projections of
    the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
    use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the
    projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
    recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value.
    Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that
    include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows,
    reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
    appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
    their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
    close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
    sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
    discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments
    of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the investments of our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as
    “available-for-sale” as defined in Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting
    for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and
    are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held
    for the purpose of providing the funding source to pay
    professional liability claims covered by the insurance
    subsidiary. We perform a quarterly assessment of individual
    investment securities to determine whether declines in market
    value are temporary or other-than-temporary. Our investment
    securities evaluation process involves multiple subjective
    judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future
    events, and requires a significant level of professional
    judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. We
    evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near
    term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s
    industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or
    timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and
    recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine
    if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below
    amortized cost is considered other-than-temporary. The length of
    time and extent to which the fair value of the investment is
    less than amortized cost and our ability and intent to retain
    the investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
    investment’s fair value, are important components of our
    investment securities evaluation process.

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
    tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment
    reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible
    impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at
    the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below
    the business segment level, and our impairment testing is
    performed at the operating division or market level. We compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying
    amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is
    potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair
    value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value
    of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recognized. Fair value of goodwill is estimated based
    upon internal evaluations of the related long-lived assets for
    each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of
    revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar
    facilities. We recognized goodwill impairments of
    $48 million during 2008. No goodwill impairments were
    recognized during 2007 and 2006.

During 2008, goodwill increased by $43 million related to
    acquisitions, decreased by $14 million related to facility
    sales, decreased by $48 million related to impairments and
    decreased by $30 million related to foreign currency
    translation and other adjustments. During 2007, goodwill
    increased by $44 million related to acquisitions, decreased
    by $45 million related to facility sales and increased by
    $29 million related to foreign currency translation and
    other adjustments.

Physician
    Recruiting Agreements

In order to recruit physicians to meet the needs of our
    hospitals and the communities they serve, we enter into minimum
    revenue guarantee arrangements to assist the recruited
    physicians during the period they are relocating and
    establishing their practices. A guarantor is required to
    recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
    fair value of the stand-ready obligation undertaken in issuing
    the guarantee. We expense the total estimated guarantee
    liability amount at the time the physician recruiting agreement
    becomes effective as we are not able to justify recording a
    contract-based asset based upon our analysis of the related
    control, regulatory and legal considerations.

The physician recruiting liability amounts of $27 million
    and $22 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, represent the amount of expense recognized in
    excess of payments made through December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. At December 31, 2008 the maximum amount of
    all effective minimum revenue guarantees that could be paid
    prospectively was $66 million.

Professional
    Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were
    $1.387 billion and $1.513 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. The current portion of the
    reserves, $279 million and $280 million at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance
    sheet. Provisions for losses related to professional liability
    risks were $175 million, $163 million and
    $217 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are
    included in “other operating expenses” in our
    consolidated income statement. Provisions for losses related to
    professional liability risks are based upon actuarially
    determined estimates. Loss and loss expense reserves represent
    the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported
    losses incurred through the respective consolidated balance
    sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses
    are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and
    actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects
    of trends in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are
    continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience
    develops or new information becomes known. Adjustments to the
    estimated reserve amounts are included in current operating
    results. The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,800 and 2,600 individual claims at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2008 and 2007,
    $314 million and $236 million, respectively, of net
    payments were made for professional and general liability
    claims. The estimation of the timing of payments beyond a year
    can vary significantly. Although considerable variability is
    inherent in professional liability reserve estimates, we believe
    the reserves for losses and loss expenses are adequate; however,
    there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not
    exceed our estimates.

A portion of our professional liability risks is insured through
    a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a
    $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention (in place
    since January 1, 2007), our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has
    obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally
    above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We
    also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
    our insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are included in
    the reserves for professional liability risks, as the insurance
    subsidiary remains liable to the extent the reinsurers do not
    meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. The
    amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include
    $28 million and $14 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, recorded in “other assets” and
    $29 million and $30 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively, recorded in “other current
    assets”.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including interest rate and foreign currency exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally, changes
    in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges
    are recorded in earnings, along with the changes in the fair
    value of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk. Gains
    and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the
    extent they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive
    income, and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the
    impact of the forecasted transactions when they occur. In the
    event the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge
    relates is no longer likely, the amount in other comprehensive
    income is recognized in earnings and generally the derivative is
    terminated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not
    qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a hedge that is
    ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining term of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Minority
    Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
    entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded minority
    interests in the earnings and equity of such entities.

Recent
    Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
    “FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 141(R), “Business Combinations”
    (“SFAS 141(R)”). This new standard will change
    the financial accounting and reporting of business combination
    transactions in consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141(R)
    replaces FASB Statement No. 141, “Business
    Combinations” (“SFAS 141”). SFAS 141(R)
    retains the fundamental requirements in SFAS 141 that the
    acquisition method of accounting (which SFAS 141 called the
    purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for
    an acquirer to be identified for each business combination.
    SFAS 141(R) defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains
    control of one or more businesses in the business combination
    and establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer
    achieves control. The scope of SFAS 141(R) is broader than
    that of SFAS 141, which applied only to business
    combinations in which control was obtained by transferring
    consideration. SFAS 141(R) applies the acquisition method
    to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains
    control over one or more other businesses. SFAS 141(R) is
    effective for business combination transactions for which the
    acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160, “Noncontrolling
    Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of
    ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). This new
    standard will change the financial accounting and reporting of
    noncontrolling (or minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements. SFAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare
    consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit
    organizations. SFAS 160 amends certain of ARB
    No. 51’s consolidation procedures to provide
    consistency with the requirements of SFAS 141(R).
    SFAS 160 is required to be adopted concurrently with
    SFAS 141(R) and is effective for fiscal years and interim
    periods beginning on or after December 15, 2008.
    SFAS 160 will require retroactive restatement to provide
    for consistent presentation of noncontrolling interests for all
    periods presented.

    related hedged items are accounted for and (c) how

MERGER
    AND RECAPITALIZATION

On July 24, 2006, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of
    Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Hercules Holding
    II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Hercules
    Holding”), and Hercules Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
    corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hercules Holding
    (“Merger Sub”). Our board of directors approved the
    Merger Agreement on the unanimous recommendation of a special
    committee comprised entirely of disinterested directors. The
    Merger was approved by a majority of HCA’s shareholders at
    a special meeting of shareholders held on November 16, 2006.

On November 17, 2006, pursuant to the terms of the Merger
    Agreement, the Investors consummated the acquisition of the
    Company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
    Company. The Company was the surviving corporation in the
    Merger. At December 31, 2008, 97.3% of our common stock is
    owned by the Investors and certain other investors, with the
    remainder being owned by certain members of management and
    employees of the Company.

Rollover
    and Stockholder Agreements And Equity Securities with Contingent
    Redemption Rights

In connection with the Merger, the Frist Entities and certain
    members of our management entered into agreements with the
    Company

and/or

Hercules Holding, pursuant to which they elected to invest in
    the Company, as the surviving corporation in the Merger, through
    a rollover of employee stock options, a rollover of shares of
    common stock of the Company, or a combination thereof. Pursuant
    to the rollover agreements the Frist Entities and management
    team made rollover investments of $885 million and
    $125 million, respectively.

The stockholder agreements, among other things, contain
    agreements among the parties with respect to restrictions on the
    transfer of shares, including tag along rights and drag along
    rights, registration rights (including customary indemnification
    provisions) and other rights. Pursuant to the management
    stockholder agreements, the applicable employees can elect to
    have the Company redeem their common stock and vested stock
    options in the events of death or permanent disability, prior to
    the consummation of the initial public offering of common stock
    by the Company. At December 31, 2008, 1,698,400 common
    shares and 2,937,000 vested stock options were subject to these
    contingent redemption terms.

Management
    Agreement

Affiliates of the Investors entered into a management agreement
    with us pursuant to which such affiliates will provide us with
    management services. Under the management agreement, the
    affiliates of the Investors are entitled to receive an aggregate
    annual management fee of $15 million, which amount will
    increase annually, beginning in 2008, at a rate equal to the
    percentage increase in Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the
    Management Agreement) in the applicable year compared to the
    preceding year, and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
    incurred in connection with the provision of services pursuant
    to the agreement. The management agreement has an initial term
    expiring on December 31, 2016, provided that the term will
    be extended annually for one additional year unless we or the
    Investors provide notice to the other of their desire not to
    automatically extend the term. In addition, the management
    agreement provides that the affiliates of the Investors are
    entitled to receive a fee equal to 1% of the gross transaction
    value in connection with certain financing, acquisition,
    disposition, and change of control transactions, as well as a
    termination fee based on the net present value of future payment
    obligations under the management agreement in the event of an
    initial public offering or under certain other circumstances.
    The agreement also contains customary exculpation and
    indemnification provisions in favor of the Investors and their
    affiliates.

Recapitalization
    Transaction Costs

For the year ended December 31, 2006, our results of
    operations include the following expenses related to the
    Recapitalization (dollars in millions):

Compensation expense related to accelerated vesting of stock
    options and restricted stock, and other employee benefits

$


Consulting, legal, accounting and other transaction costs


Loss on extinguishment of debt


Total

In addition to these amounts, approximately $77 million of
    transaction costs were recorded directly to shareholders’
    deficit, and an additional $568 million of transaction
    costs were capitalized as deferred loan costs.

SHARE-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”),
    using the modified prospective application transition method.
    Under this method, compensation cost is recognized, beginning
    January 1, 2006, based on the requirements of
    SFAS 123(R) for all share-based awards granted after the
    effective date, and based on Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), for all awards
    granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006 that were
    unvested on the effective date.

Upon consummation of the Merger, all outstanding stock options
    (other than certain options held by certain rollover
    shareholders) became fully vested, were cancelled and converted
    into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the number of
    shares underlying the options multiplied by the amount (if any)
    by which $51.00 exceeded the option exercise price. The
    acceleration of vesting of stock options resulted in the
    recognition of $42 million of additional share-based
    compensation expense for 2006.

Certain management holders of outstanding HCA stock options were
    permitted to retain certain of their stock options (the
    “Rollover Options”) in lieu of receiving the merger
    consideration (the amount, if any, by which $51.00 exceeded the
    option exercise price). The Rollover Options remain outstanding
    in accordance with the terms of the governing stock incentive
    plans and grant agreements pursuant to which the holder
    originally received the stock

option grants, except the exercise price and number of shares
    subject to the rollover option agreement were adjusted so that
    the aggregate intrinsic value for each applicable option holder
    was maintained and the exercise price for substantially all the
    options was adjusted to $12.75 per option. Pursuant to the
    rollover option agreement, 10,967,500 prerecapitalization HCA
    stock options were converted into 2,285,200 Rollover Options, of
    which 1,797,200 are outstanding and exercisable at
    December 31, 2008.

SFAS 123(R) requires that the benefits of tax deductions in
    excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost be reported as
    a financing cash flow. Tax benefits of $7 million,
    $1 million and $97 million from tax deductions in
    excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost were reported
    as financing cash flows in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

    Stock Incentive Plan

In connection with the Recapitalization, the 2006 Stock
    Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Inc. and its Affiliates
    (the “2006 Plan”) was established. The 2006 Plan is
    designed to promote the long term financial interests and growth
    of the Company and its subsidiaries by attracting and retaining
    management and other personnel and key service providers and to
    motivate management personnel by means of incentives to achieve
    long range goals and further the alignment of interests of
    participants with those of our stockholders through
    opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in
    the Company. A portion of the options under the 2006 Plan vests
    solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of
    time, and a portion of the options vests based both upon
    continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the
    achievement of predetermined financial and Investor return
    targets over time. We granted 357,500 and 9,328,000 options
    under the 2006 Plan during 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2008, 1,186,200 options granted under the 2006
    Plan have vested, and there were 1,788,300 shares available
    for future grants under the 2006 Plan.

    Equity Incentive Plan

Prior to the Recapitalization, the HCA 2005 Equity Incentive
    Plan was the primary plan under which stock options and
    restricted stock were granted to officers, employees and
    directors. Upon consummation of the Recapitalization, all shares
    of restricted stock became fully vested, were cancelled and
    converted into the right to receive a cash payment of $51.00 per
    restricted share. During 2006, we recognized $247 million
    of compensation costs related to restricted share grants. The
    acceleration of vesting of restricted stock resulted in the
    recognition of $201 million of the total compensation
    expense related to restricted stock for 2006.

continued employment and based upon achievement of certain
    financial and Investor return-based targets. Each grant is
    valued as a single award with an expected term equal to the
    average expected term of the component vesting tranches. We use
    historical option exercise behavior data and other factors to
    estimate the expected term of the options. The expected term of
    the option is limited by the contractual term, and employee
    post-vesting termination behavior is incorporated in the
    historical option exercise behavior data. Compensation cost is
    recognized on the straight-line attribution method. The
    straight-line attribution method requires that total
    compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested
    portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is
    derived using historical stock price information of certain peer
    group companies for a period of time equal to the expected
    option term. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate
    yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to
    the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life
    is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held

ACQUISITIONS
    AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2008, we paid $18 million to acquire one hospital
    and $67 million to acquire other health care entities.
    During 2007, we did not acquire any hospitals, but paid
    $32 million for other health care entities. During 2006, we
    paid $63 million to acquire three hospitals and
    $49 million to acquire other health care entities. Purchase
    price amounts have been allocated to the related assets acquired
    and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.
    The purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of
    identifiable net assets of acquired entities aggregated
    $43 million, $44 million and $38 million in 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts and operations of the acquired
    entities subsequent to the respective acquisition dates. The pro
    forma effects of the acquired entities on our results of
    operations for periods prior to the respective acquisition dates
    were not significant.

During 2008, we received proceeds of $143 million and
    recognized a net pretax gain of $81 million
    ($48 million after tax) on the sales of two hospitals. We
    also received proceeds of $50 million and recognized a net
    pretax gain of $16 million ($10 million after tax)
    from sales of other health care entities and real estate
    investments. During 2007, we received proceeds of
    $661 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $443 million ($272 million after tax) from sales of
    three hospitals. We also received proceeds of $106 million
    and recognized a net pretax gain of $28 million
    ($18 million after tax) from sales of real estate
    investments. During 2006, we received proceeds of
    $560 million and recognized a net pretax gain of
    $176 million ($85 million after tax) on the sales of
    nine hospitals. We also received proceeds of $91 million
    and recognized a net pretax gain of $29 million
    ($18 million after tax) from sales of real estate
    investments and our equity investment in a hospital joint
    venture.

NOTE 5 —

IMPAIRMENTS
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2008, we recorded pretax charges of $64 million to
    reduce the carrying value of identified assets to estimated fair
    value. The $64 million asset impairment includes
    $55 million related to other health care entity investments
    in our Eastern Group and $9 million related to certain
    hospital facilities in our Central Group. During 2007, we
    recorded a pretax charge of $24 million to adjust the value
    of a building in our Central Group to estimated fair value.
    During 2006, the carrying value for a closed hospital was
    reduced to fair value, based upon estimates of sales value,
    resulting in a pretax charge of $16 million that affected
    our Corporate and Other Group. During 2006, we also decided to
    terminate a construction project and incurred a pretax charge of
    $8 million that affected our Corporate and Other Group.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
    on our operations or cash flows and are not expected to
    significantly impact cash flows for future periods. The
    impairment charges affected our property and equipment asset
    category by $16 million, $24 million and
    $24 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

As a result of a settlement reached with the Appeals Division of
    the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and the
    revision of a proposed IRS adjustment related to prior taxable
    years, we reduced our provision for income taxes by
    $69 million in 2008. Our 2007 provision for income taxes
    was reduced by $85 million, principally based on new
    information received related to tax positions taken in a prior
    taxable year, and by an additional $39 million to adjust

one year may be limited and, in certain cases, result in an
    adjustment to intangible assets. Net deferred tax assets related
    to such carryforwards are not significant.

We are currently contesting before the IRS Appeals Division
    certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS
    in connection with its examination of the 2003 and 2004 federal
    income tax returns for HCA and 17 affiliates that are treated as
    partnerships for federal income tax purposes (“affiliated
    partnerships”). The disputed items include the timing of
    recognition of certain patient service revenues and our method
    for calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts.

Eight taxable periods of HCA and its predecessors ended in 1995
    through 2002 and the 2002 taxable year for 13 affiliated
    partnerships, for which the primary remaining issue is the
    computation of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are
    pending before the IRS Examination Division or the United States
    Tax Court as of December 31, 2008. The IRS began an audit
    of the 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns for HCA and
    seven affiliated partnerships during 2008.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 creates a
    single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and
    clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the
    minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet
    before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48
    applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to
    FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income
    Taxes.” The provision for income taxes reflects a
    $20 million ($12 million net of tax) reduction in
    interest related to taxing authority examinations for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 and interest expense of
    $17 million ($11 million net of tax) for the year
    ended December 31, 2007.

    unrecognized tax benefits (dollars in millions):

During 2008, we reached a settlement with the IRS Appeals
    Division relating to the deductibility of the 2001 government
    settlement payment, the timing of recognition of certain patient
    service revenues for 2001 and 2002, and the amount of insurance
    expense deducted in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the
    settlement, $111 million of the $215 million
    refundable deposit made in 2006 has been applied to tax and
    interest due for the 2001 and 2002 taxable years.

Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was
    $625 million, including accrued interest of
    $156 million and excluding $13 million that was
    recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets, as of
    December 31, 2008 ($828 million, $218 million and
    $12 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007).
    Unrecognized tax benefits of $264 million
    ($489 million as of December 31, 2007) would
    affect the effective rate, if recognized. The liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits does not reflect deferred tax assets
    related to deductible interest and state income taxes or the
    balance of a refundable deposit we made in 2006, which is
    recorded in noncurrent assets.

Depending on the resolution of the IRS disputes, the completion
    of examinations by federal, state or international taxing
    authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for
    specific taxing jurisdictions, we

believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits may significantly increase or decrease
    within the next twelve months. However, we are currently unable
    to estimate the range of any possible change.

Interest
    Rate Swap Agreements

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our
    exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
    agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
    interest payments between two parties based on common notional
    principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate
    swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate
    instruments to fixed interest rate obligations. The net interest
    payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements,
    generally match the timing of the related liabilities. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis.

The following table sets forth our interest rate swap
    agreements, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, at
    December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions):

    obligations are denominated in currencies (Great Britain
    Pound and Euro), other than the functional currencies (United
    States Dollar and Great Britain Pound) of the parties executing
    the trade. In order to better match the cash flows of our
    obligations and intercompany transactions with cash flows from
    operations, we entered into various cross currency swaps. Our
    credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
    because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
    institutions.

ASSETS
    AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

On January 1, 2008, we adopted Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value
    Measurements” (“SFAS 157”). SFAS 157
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
    SFAS 157 applies to reported balances that are required or
    permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting
    pronouncements.

SFAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based
    measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a
    fair value measurement should be determined based on the
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
    asset or liability. As a basis for considering market
    participant assumptions in fair value measurements,
    SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on
    market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
    entity (observable inputs that are classified within
    Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting
    entity’s own assumptions about market participant
    assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3
    of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
    are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for
    similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as
    inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other
    than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange
    rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted
    intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the
    asset or liability, which are typically based on an
    entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any,
    related market activity. In instances where the determination of
    the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different
    levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value
    hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls
    is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the
    fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the
    significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement
    in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors
    specific to the asset or liability.

Cash
    Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within
    Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because
    they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer
    quotations, or alternative pricing sources with

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 9 —

    Traded Investments (Continued)

reasonable levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash
    traded instruments are classified within Level 3 of the
    fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and
    therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments
    include auction rate securities (“ARS”) and limited
    partnership investments. The transaction price is initially used
    as the best estimate of fair value.

Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had investments in
    municipal, tax-exempt ARS, that are backed by student loans
    substantially guaranteed by the federal government, of
    $536 million ($573 million par value) at
    December 31, 2008. We do not currently intend to attempt to
    sell the ARS as the liquidity needs of our insurance subsidiary
    are expected to be met by other investments in its investment
    portfolio. These securities continue to accrue and pay interest
    semi-annually based on the failed auction maximum rate formulas
    stated in their respective Official Statements. During 2008,
    certain issuers of our ARS redeemed $93 million of our
    securities at par value. The valuation of these securities
    involved management’s judgment, after consideration of
    market factors and the absence of market transparency, market
    liquidity and observable inputs. Our valuation models derived a
    fair market value compared to tax-equivalent yields of other
    student loan backed variable rate securities of similar credit
    worthiness.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate and cross currency swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
    rates and foreign currency risks. The valuation of these
    instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation
    techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the
    expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects
    the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period
    to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
    interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied
    volatilities. To comply with the provisions of SFAS 157, we
    incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own
    nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s
    nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used
    to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair
    value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated
    with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as
    estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood
    of default by us and our counterparties. We have assessed the
    significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments
    on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have
    determined that the credit valuation adjustments are significant
    to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we
    have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety
    are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy at
    December 31, 2008.

Senior
    Secured Credit Facilities

In connection with the Recapitalization, we entered into
    (i) a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based
    revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of 85% of
    eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and
    eligibility criteria (fully utilized at December 31, 2008)
    (the “ABL credit facility”) and (ii) a senior
    secured credit agreement (the “cash flow credit
    facility” and, together with the ABL credit facility, the
    “senior secured credit facilities”), consisting of a
    $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.858 billion available at December 31, 2008 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($2.525 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2008), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    ($8.624 billion outstanding at December 31,
    2008) and a €1.000 billion European term loan
    (€611 million, or $853 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2008) under which one of our European
    subsidiaries is the borrower.

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to, as determined by the type of
    borrowing, either an applicable margin plus, at our option,
    either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the
    higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus


/


of 1% or (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or
    (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the
    relevant interest period, plus, in each case, an applicable
    margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior
    secured credit facilities, with the exception of term loan B
    where the margin is static, may be reduced subject to attaining
    certain leverage ratios.

The ABL facility and the $2.000 billion revolving credit
    facility portion of the cash flow credit facility expire
    November 2012. The term loan facilities require quarterly
    installment payments. The final payment under term loan A is in
    November 2012. The final payments under term loan B and the
    European term loan are in November 2013. The senior secured
    credit facilities contain a number of covenants that restrict,
    subject to certain exceptions, our (and some or all of our
    subsidiaries’) ability to incur additional indebtedness,
    repay subordinated indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell
    assets, make investments, loans or advances, engage in certain
    transactions with affiliates, pay dividends and distributions,
    and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we
    are required to satisfy and maintain a maximum total leverage
    ratio covenant under the cash flow facility and, in certain
    situations under the ABL credit facility, a minimum interest
    coverage ratio covenant.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the floating rate

    November 2008, we elected to make an interest payment for the
    interest period ending in May 2009 by paying in-kind instead of
    paying interest in cash.

General
    Information

The senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes
    are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all
    existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly-owned material
    domestic subsidiaries that are “Unrestricted
    Subsidiaries” under our Indenture dated December 16,
    1993 (except for certain special purpose subsidiaries that only
    guarantee and pledge their assets under our ABL credit
    facility). In addition, borrowings under the European term loan
    are guaranteed by all material, wholly-owned European
    subsidiaries.

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2010 through 2013 are
    $1.144 billion, $896 million, $4.707 billion and
    $10.095 billion, respectively.

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was
    $20.225 billion and $26.127 billion at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, compared to
    carrying amounts aggregating $26.989 billion and
    $27.308 billion, respectively. The estimates of fair value
    are generally based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.

CONTINGENCIES

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse affect on our results of operations or financial
    position in a given period.

We are subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
    staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may
    seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by
    insurance. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate
    resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will
    not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial position.

    Repurchase Program

In 2005, we announced the authorization of a modified
    “Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
    $2.500 billion of our common stock. During 2006, we
    repurchased 13.0 million shares of our common stock for
    $653 million, through open market purchases, which
    completed this authorization.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

We maintained a noncontributory, defined contribution retirement
    plan which covered substantially all employees. Benefits were
    determined as a percentage of a participant’s salary and
    vest over specified periods of employee service. Retirement plan
    expense was $46 million for 2008, $203 million for
    2007 and $190 million for 2006. Amounts approximately equal
    to retirement plan expense are funded annually. Effective
    April 1, 2008, the noncontributory plan and the related
    participant account balances were merged into the contributory
    HCA 401(k) Plan.

We maintain contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
    that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
    requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match
    specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain
    maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending
    upon years of vesting service, of compensation deferred by
    participants for periods subsequent to March 31, 2008, and
    50% of the first 3% of compensation deferred by participants for
    periods prior to April 1, 2008). The cost of these plans
    totaled $233 million for 2008, $86 million for 2007
    and $71 million for 2006. Our contributions are funded
    periodically during each year.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
    to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the
    value of a prescribed life annuity from the combination of the
    SERP and our other benefit plans. Compensation expense under the
    plan was $20 million for 2008, $20 million for 2007
    and $15 million for 2006. Accrued benefits liabilities
    under this plan totaled $133 million at December 31,
    2008 and $109 million at December 31, 2007.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from
    certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Compensation
    expense under these plans was $24 million for 2008,
    $27 million for 2007, and $31 million for 2006.
    Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled
    $142 million at December 31, 2008 and $48 million
    at December 31, 2007.

SEGMENT
    AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals
    and related health care entities. During the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately 23%, 24%
    and 25%, respectively, of our revenues related to patients
    participating in the fee-for-service Medicare program.

Our operations are structured into three geographically
    organized groups: the Eastern Group includes 48 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Eastern United States, the Central
    Group includes 51 consolidating hospitals located in the Central
    United States and the Western Group includes 53 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Western United States. We also operate
    six consolidating hospitals in England, and these facilities are
    included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
    and amortization, interest expense, gains on sales of
    facilities, impairment of long-lived assets, transaction costs,
    minority interests and income taxes. We use adjusted segment
    EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes of allocating
    resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance.
    Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical
    indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a
    measure of leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted
    segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of
    financial performance under generally accepted accounting

principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA
    are significant components in understanding and assessing
    financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a
    measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying
    calculations, adjusted segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be
    comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
    companies. The geographic distributions of our revenues, equity
    in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA, depreciation
    and amortization, assets and goodwill are summarized in the

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company
    (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA
    Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as
    collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior
    secured notes described in Note 10.

Rule 3-16

of

Regulation S-X

under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 17 —

SUPPLEMENTAL

    COLLATERAL-RELATED INFORMATION (Continued)

statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose securities
    constitute a substantial portion of the collateral for any class
    of securities registered or being registered. We believe the
    separate financial statements requirement applies to Healthtrust
    due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral for the
    senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure
    relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating
    subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust.
    The corporate structure relationship, combined with the
    application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s
    consolidated financial statements related to HCA’s debt and
    financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial
    statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the
    consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated
    financial statements of HCA and Healthtrust present the
    identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets,
    liabilities, total stockholders’ (deficit) equity, net cash
    provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing
    activities and net cash used in financing activities. Certain
    individual line items in the HCA consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ (deficit) equity and cash flows are combined
    into one line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of
    stockholder’s (deficit) equity and cash flows.

    Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity and Consolidated Statements
