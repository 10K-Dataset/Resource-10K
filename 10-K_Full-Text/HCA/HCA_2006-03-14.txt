PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in
the United States. At December 31, 2005, we operated 182
hospitals, comprised of 175 general, acute care hospitals; six
psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. The 182
hospital total includes seven hospitals (six general, acute care
hospitals and one rehabilitation hospital) owned by joint
ventures in which an affiliate of HCA is a partner, and these
joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. In
addition, we operated 94 freestanding surgery centers, seven of
which are owned by joint ventures in which an affiliate of HCA
is a partner and these joint ventures are accounted for using
the equity method. Our facilities are located in 22 states,
England and Switzerland. The terms “Company,”
“HCA,” “we,” “our” or
“us,” as used herein, refer to HCA Inc. and its
affiliates unless otherwise stated or indicated by context. The
term “affiliates” means direct and indirect
subsidiaries of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in
which such subsidiaries are partners. The terms
“facilities” or “hospitals” refer to
entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and references
to “employees” refer to employees of affiliates of HCA.

HCA’s primary objective is to provide the communities we
serve a comprehensive array of quality health care services in
the most cost-effective manner possible. Our general, acute care
hospitals typically provide a full range of services to
accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine,
general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics
and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic and emergency services.
Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by
our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers,
diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our
psychiatric hospitals provide a full range of mental health care
services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and
outpatient settings.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. HCA’s
principal executive offices are located at One Park Plaza,
Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is
(615) 344-9551.

Business Strategy

HCA is committed to providing the communities we serve high
quality, cost-effective health care while maintaining
consistency with our ethics and compliance program, governmental
regulations and guidelines, and industry standards. As a part of
this strategy, management focuses on the following areas:

Health Care Facilities

HCA currently owns, manages or operates hospitals; freestanding
surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2005, HCA owned and operated 169 general,
acute care hospitals with 40,665 licensed beds, and an
additional six general, acute care hospitals with 2,127 licensed
beds are operated through joint ventures, which are accounted
for using the equity method. Most of our general, acute care
hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including
inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic
services and emergency services. The general, acute care
hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient
surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology
and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical
staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up
of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical
research and education programs. However, some of our hospitals
are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the
clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other
education programs.

At December 31, 2005, HCA operated six psychiatric
hospitals with 600 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and
adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug
abuse treatment and counseling.

Outpatient health care facilities operated by HCA include
freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers,
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy
centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and
various other facilities. These outpatient services are an
integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive
health care networks in select communities.

In addition to providing capital resources, HCA affiliates
provide a variety of management services to our health care
facilities, including patient safety programs; ethics and
compliance programs; national supply contracts; equipment
purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting, financial and
clinical systems; governmental reimbursement assistance;
construction planning and coordination; information technology
systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resources services;
and internal audit services.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
depending on the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical,
intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of
the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various
reasons, many of which are beyond our control.



HCA receives payment for patient services from the federal
government primarily under the Medicare program, state
governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs,
managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients.
The approximate percentages of our patient revenues from such
sources were as follows:

Year Ended December 31,


2004(a)


Medicare


%

Medicaid




Managed Medicaid



(a

)

Managed care and other insurers

(a)

Prior to 2004, managed Medicaid revenues were classified as
    either Medicaid or managed care and certain 2004 amounts have
    been reclassified to conform to the 2005 presentation.

(b)

Uninsured revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005
    were reduced by $769 million of discounts to the uninsured,
    related to the uninsured discount program implemented
    January 1, 2005.

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
disabled persons and persons with end-stage renal disease.
Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states,
which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying
individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our
general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are
certified as health care services providers for persons covered
under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under
Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less
than established hospital gross charges for the services
provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges
to certain group purchasers of health care services, including
private insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other
managed care plans. These discount programs limit our ability to
increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See
Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
between established hospital gross charges and amounts
reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs or
PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the
extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of
their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
coinsurance has been increasing each year. Collection of amounts
due from individuals is typically more difficult than from
governmental or third-party payers. In 2003, we implemented
changes to our uninsured care policies to provide financial
relief to more of our uninsured patients. On January 1,
2005, we modified our policies to provide a discount to
uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
care. These discounts are similar to those provided to many
local managed care plans. In implementing the discount policy,
we attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other
federal or state assistance or charity care. If an uninsured
patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured
discount is applied. See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Results of Operations —
Revenue/ Volume Trends.”

Medicare

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a
prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
care hospital inpatient services. Under hospital inpatient PPS,
fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established
based on the patient’s assigned diagnosis related group
(“DRG”). DRGs classify treatments for illnesses
according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources
necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. DRG
weights represent the average resources for a given DRG relative
to the average resources for all DRGs. When the cost to treat
certain patients falls well outside the normal



distribution, providers typically receive additional
“outlier” payments. DRG payments do not consider a
specific hospital’s cost, but are adjusted for area wage
differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as
“new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital
costs based on DRG weights multiplied by a geographically
adjusted federal rate.

DRG rates are updated and DRG weights are recalibrated each
federal fiscal year. The index used to update the DRG rates (the
“market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation
experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care
industry in purchasing goods and services. However, for several
years the percentage increases to the DRG rates have been lower
than the percentage increases in the costs of goods and services
purchased by hospitals. In federal fiscal year 2005, the DRG
rate increase was market basket of 3.3%. For federal fiscal year
2006, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(“CMS”) set the DRG rate increase at full market
basket of 3.7%. Through recent legislation, including the
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act
of 2003 (“MMA”), Congress equalized the DRG payment
rate for urban and rural hospitals at the large urban rate for
all hospitals, for discharges on or after April 1, 2003.
MMA provides for DRG rate increases for federal fiscal years
2005, 2006, and 2007 at full market basket, if data for ten
patient care quality indicators is submitted to the Secretary of
the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).
Those hospitals not submitting data on the ten quality
indicators will receive an increase equal to the market basket
rate minus 0.4 percentage points. All HCA hospitals paid under
Medicare inpatient DRG PPS are participating in the quality
initiative by the Secretary of HHS by submitting the quality
data requested for federal fiscal year 2006. For federal fiscal
year 2007, MMA provides for a full market basket update. The
Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPAC”) has
adopted a recommendation that Congress update inpatient PPS
payments for fiscal year 2007 by the market basket minus
0.45 percentage points. It is uncertain whether Congress
will adopt this recommendation. On February 8, 2006, the
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DEFRA 2005”) was
enacted by Congress and expanded the number of quality measures
that must be reported to receive a full market basket update for
federal fiscal year 2007. Failure to submit the required quality
indicators will result in a two percentage point reduction to
the market basket update. We will attempt to comply with the
DEFRA 2005 reporting requirements, but we are unable to predict
if all our hospitals will be able to comply.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.1% of
Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. In June
2003, CMS adopted significant regulatory changes to outlier
payments. Included in the regulatory changes were provisions to:
(1) use the most recent settled cost report to establish
the hospital’s

cost-to

-charge ratio,
(2) eliminate the use of the statewide average when the
hospital’s

cost-to

-charge ratio
falls three standard deviations below the national average, and
(3) permit CMS to reconcile outlier payments in the
Medicare cost report for hospitals meeting CMS defined audit
criteria. As a result of these changes, CMS set the outlier
threshold at $31,000 and $25,800 for federal fiscal years 2004
and 2005, respectively. CMS estimates that outlier payments were
3.5% and 4.1% of total operating DRG payments for federal fiscal
years 2004 and 2005, respectively. For federal fiscal year 2006,
CMS has established an outlier threshold of $23,600. Decreasing
the outlier threshold in federal fiscal year 2006 will increase
both the number of cases that qualify for outlier payments and
the amount of payments for qualifying outlier cases; however,
outlier payments are not expected to return to federal fiscal
year 2003 and prior payment levels.

HCA recorded $148 million, $124 million and
$221 million of revenues related to Medicare operating
outlier cases for 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. These
amounts represent 2.2%, 1.9% and 3.7% of our Medicare revenues
and 0.6%, 0.5% and 1.0% of our total revenues for 2005, 2004,
and 2003, respectively.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS has
continued to use existing fee schedules to pay for physical,
occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment,
clinical diagnostic laboratory services and nonimplantable
orthotics and prosthetics. Freestanding surgery centers and
independent diagnostic testing facilities are reimbursed on a
fee schedule.



Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into
groups called ambulatory payment classifications
(“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2004 and
2005 by market basket of 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively. The update
for calendar year 2006 is market basket of 3.7%. However, as a
result of the expiration of additional payments for drugs that
were being paid in calendar year 2005, for calendar year 2006
there has been an effective 2.25% reduction to the market basket
of 3.7%. For calendar year 2007, MMA provides for a full market
basket update. MedPAC has adopted a recommendation that Congress
update outpatient PPS payments for fiscal year 2007 by the
market basket minus 0.45 percentage points. It is uncertain
whether Congress will adopt this recommendation.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities
(“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under IRF PPS, patients are
classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
comorbidities and functional capability. IRFs are paid a
predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
For federal fiscal years 2004 and 2005, CMS updated the PPS rate
for rehabilitation hospitals and units by market basket of 3.2%
and 3.1%, respectively. For federal fiscal year 2006, CMS has
updated the PPS rate for IRFs by market basket of 3.6%. However,
CMS also applied a reduction to the standard payment amount of
1.9% to account for improved coding under IRF PPS. For fiscal
year 2007, IRF PPS rates are to be updated by full market basket
under current law. As of December 31, 2005, we had one
rehabilitation hospital, which is operated through a joint
venture, and 53 hospital rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
criteria for being classified as an IRF, commonly known as the
“75 percent rule”. CMS revised the medical
conditions for patients served by rehabilitation facilities from
ten medical conditions to 13 conditions. The final rule provides
for a transition to targeting payments to facilities that treat
a large share of patients with diagnoses likely to require
intensive rehabilitation. For cost reporting periods that began
on or after July 1, 2004, and before July 1, 2005, the
compliance threshold was set at 50% of the IRF’s total
patient population. For cost reporting periods beginning on or
after July 1, 2005, and before July 1, 2006, the
compliance threshold is set at 60% of the IRF’s total
patient population. For cost reporting periods beginning on or
after July 1, 2006, and before July 1, 2007, the
compliance threshold is set at 65% of the IRF’s total
patient population. The compliance threshold will be set at 75%
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1,
2007. In 2004, Congress enacted legislation preventing CMS from
enforcing the final rule until the Government Accountability
Office (“GAO”) completed a study on the rule’s
impact on IRFs and patients. The GAO has issued their report and
CMS has proceeded with implementation of the
“75 percent rule”. DEFRA 2005 revised the
phase-in period for the “75 percent rule” to retain
the 60% threshold for cost reporting periods beginning on or
after July 1, 2006 and before July 1, 2007 with the
threshold increasing to 65% in 2007 and 75% in 2008.
Implementation of the “75 percent rule” has
started to reduce our IRF admissions and can be expected to
continue to significantly restrict the treatment of patients
whose medical conditions do not meet any of the 13 approved
conditions.

Medicare fiscal intermediaries have been given the authority to
develop and implement Local Coverage Determinations
(“LCD”) to determine the medical necessity of care
rendered to Medicare patients where there is no national
coverage determination. Some intermediaries have finalized their
LCDs for rehabilitation services. A restrictive rehabilitation
LCD has the potential to significantly impact Medicare
rehabilitation payments. The financial impact to HCA of any
final rehabilitation LCD is uncertain.

Psychiatric

Payments to PPS-exempt psychiatric hospitals and units are based
upon reasonable cost, subject to a cost-per-discharge target
(the TEFRA limits) for cost reporting periods that began before
January 1, 2005. These limits are updated annually by a
market basket index. The update to a hospital’s target
amount for its cost reporting periods beginning in federal
fiscal years 2004 and 2005 was market basket of 3.4% and 3.3%,
respectively. Caps had been established for the
cost-per-discharge target at the 75th percentile for each
category of PPS-exempt hospitals and units. For cost reporting
periods beginning on or after October 1, 2002,



payments to these PPS-exempt hospitals and units are no longer
subject to these caps. However, if a PPS-exempt hospital or unit
was subject to the cap in the cost report for the year prior to
October 1, 2002, such limitation will be included in its
future target amount. The cost-per-discharge for new hospitals
and hospital units cannot exceed 110% of the national median
target rate for hospitals in the same category. The target
amount for federal fiscal year 2006 is subject to a market
basket update of 3.8% for psychiatric hospitals and units that
are being paid under the three year transition to the inpatient
psychiatric PPS.

On November 15, 2004, CMS published a final regulation to
implement a PPS for inpatient hospital services furnished in
psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute
care hospitals and critical access hospitals (“IPF
PPS”). The new prospective payment system replaces the
cost-based system for reporting periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2005. IPF PPS is a per diem prospective payment
system, with adjustments to account for certain patient and
facility characteristics. IPF PPS contains an
“outlier” policy for extraordinarily costly cases and
an adjustment to a facility’s base payment if it maintains
a full-service emergency department. IPF PPS is being
implemented over a three-year transition period with full
payment under IPF PPS to begin in the fourth year. Also, CMS has
included a stop-loss provision to ensure that hospitals avoid
significant losses during the transition. CMS has established
the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget
neutral and has adopted a July 1 update cycle. Thus, the
initial IPF PPS per diem payment rate will be effective for the

18-month

period
January 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006. On
January 23, 2006, CMS published a proposed rule to update
the IPF PPS for rate year 2007(July 1, 2006 to
June 30, 2007) that would result in a 4.7% increase in
overall payments to IPFs (reflecting the blend of the 4.8%
update for IPF TEFRA and the 4.5% update for IPF PPS payments).
The market basket update accounts for moving from a calendar
year to a rate year (the annual market basket is estimated to be
3.6%). This rule has not yet been finalized. As of
December 31, 2005, HCA had six psychiatric hospitals and 37
hospital psychiatric units.

Other

Under PPS, the prospective payment rates are adjusted for the
area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage
index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the
geographic area compared to the national average wage level.
Effective October 1, 2004 for inpatient PPS and
January 1, 2005 for outpatient PPS, CMS implemented a
number of changes to the wage index calculation. These changes
included the adoption of standards for defining labor market
geographic areas based on standards for defining Core-Based
Statistical Areas (“CBSA”) issued by the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”). Hospitals that were
adversely impacted by this new definition received a blended
(50/50) wage index based on the old and new wage geographic
definitions for one year. Further, CMS has applied an
occupational mix adjustment factor to the wage index amounts for
the first time, but has limited the adjustment to 10% of the
wage index. MMA lowered the labor share for inpatient PPS
payments from 71.1% to 62%, effective October 1, 2004,
unless the lower percentage would result in lower payments to
the hospital. This change, in effect, increases payments for all
hospitals whose wage index is less than or equal to 1.0. For all
other hospitals, CMS lowered the 71.1% labor share to 69.7%,
effective October 1, 2005. Also, effective October 1,
2005, IRF PPS adopted the CBSA definition of labor market
geographic areas but have not adopted an occupational mix
adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2006, IRFs will receive a
blended (50/50) wage index based on the old and new wage
geographic definitions. The geographic definition changes and
the occupational mix adjustment have not been applied to IPF PPS
at this time. However, in the proposed rule published on
January 23, 2006, CMS has proposed to adopt the CBSA
definition of labor market geographic areas for IPF PPS
effective July 1, 2006. The financial impact, if any, that
these changes will have on the Company beyond 2006 is uncertain.

CMS has a significant initiative underway that could affect the
administration of the Medicare program and impact how hospitals
bill and receive payment for covered Medicare services. In
accordance with MMA, CMS will implement contractor reform
whereby CMS will competitively bid the Medicare fiscal
intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to Medicare
Administrative Contractors (“MACs”). CMS plans to
award the first of 15 multi-state jurisdictions in June 2006.
Seven jurisdictions are planned to be awarded in September 2007
and the remaining seven jurisdictions are planned to be awarded
in September 2008. All of these changes



could impact claim processing functions and the resulting cash
flow. The Company is unable to predict the impact that these
changes could have, if any, to cash flow.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government
and the states and are administered by states under approved
plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual
hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a
hospital’s cost of services. The federal government and
many states are currently considering altering the level of
Medicaid funding (including upper payment limits) or program
eligibility that could adversely affect future levels of
Medicaid reimbursement received by our hospitals. As permitted
by law, certain states in which we operate have adopted
broad-based provider taxes to fund their Medicaid programs.

Managed Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs relate to situations where states
contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care
management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not
abdicate program responsibilities for financing, eligibility
criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract
directly with one of the designated entities, usually a managed
care organization. The provisions of these programs are state
specific.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
revenue, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us
under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require
several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to
or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of
appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
prior years’ reports.

In June 2003, HCA announced that the Company and the Civil
Division of the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) had
signed agreements whereby the United States would dismiss the
various claims it had brought related to physician relations,
cost reports and wound care issues (the “DOJ
Agreement”). The DOJ Agreement received court approval in
July 2003, and we paid the DOJ $641 million (including
accrued interest of $10 million) during July 2003. HCA also
finalized an agreement with a negotiating team representing
states that may have claims against HCA. Under this agreement,
we paid $17.7 million in July 2003 to state Medicaid
agencies to resolve these claims. We also paid $33 million
for legal fees of the private parties.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges
to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
including managed care plan and private insurance companies.
Admissions reimbursed by managed care and other insurers were
42%, 42% and 44% of our total admissions for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Managed
care contracts are typically negotiated for one-year or two-year
terms. While we generally received annual average yield
increases of six to seven percent from managed care payers
during 2005, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
receive increases in the future.



Hospital Utilization

HCA believes that the most important factors relating to the
overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number and quality of
physicians and other health care professionals providing patient
care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a
hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and
convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that
impact utilization include the growth in local population, local
economic conditions and market penetration of managed care
programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
our hospitals. Hospital operations are subject to certain
seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient
utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold
weather months.



Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
most of HCA’s hospitals provide services similar to those
offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in the past several
years the number of freestanding surgery centers and diagnostic
centers (including facilities owned by physicians) in the
geographic areas in which we operate has increased
significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
highly competitive environment. The rates charged by our
hospitals are intended to be competitive with those charged by
other local hospitals for similar services. In some cases,
competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals.
Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported government
agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities
that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions
and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and
income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to
our hospitals. In addition, in certain localities there are
large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized
facilities, equipment and services which may not be available at
most of our hospitals. We are facing increasing competition from
physician-owned specialty hospitals and freestanding surgery
centers for market share in high margin services. Psychiatric
hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their
immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric hospitals
compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the
psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local
communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality
of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians,
skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals,
location, breadth of services, technology offered and prices
charged. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient
services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for
physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
affiliated with the hospital. Although physicians may at any
time terminate their affiliation with a hospital operated by
HCA, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied
specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract
other qualified physicians. We believe that physicians refer
patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of
services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of
physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital
and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and
employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide
quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for
physicians and patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
is management’s ability to negotiate service contracts with
purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans
attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and
obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges.
In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are
increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations
with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from
established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for
service contracts with group health care services purchasers on
the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location,
quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and
convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed
care organizations varies from community to community, depending
on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
restricting competition. In those states which have no CON laws
or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they
become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form
of new services, facilities and capital spending is more
prevalent. See Item 1, “Business —
Regulation and Other Factors.”

HCA, and the health care industry as a whole, face the challenge
of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
and interpretations and competitive contracting for provider
services by private and government payers remain ongoing
challenges. These challenges may require changes in our
operations in the future.



Admissions and average lengths of stay continue to be negatively
affected by payer-required pre-admission authorization,
utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and
alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill
patients. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer
pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we
intend to expand many of our facilities or acquire or construct
new facilities, to better enable the provision of a
comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer discounts to
private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment, and
offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the
adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
for licensing and accreditation. We believe that our health care
facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
All of our general, acute care hospitals are certified for
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are
accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (“Joint Commission”). If any
facility were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or
otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement
from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Management believes our
facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable
federal, state, local and independent review body regulations
and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and
accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain
qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our
facilities, equipment, personnel and services.

Certificates of Need

In some states where HCA operates hospitals, the construction or
expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing
facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition
of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior
approval of state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such
laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine
the public need for additional or expanded health care
facilities and services. Failure to obtain necessary state
approval can result in the inability to expand facilities,
complete an acquisition or change ownership.

State Rate Review

Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation
mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted
taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to
fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate,
state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not
materially, adversely affected our results of operations.

Utilization Review

Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that
services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients
meet professionally recognized standards and are medically
necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed.
These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of
admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by
quality improvement organizations to assess the appropriateness
of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the
quality of care provided, the validity of DRG classifications
and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay
or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for
services provided, may assess fines and also have the authority
to recommend to HHS that a provider, which is in substantial
noncompliance with the appropriate standards, be excluded from
participating in the Medicare program. Most nongovernmental
managed care organizations also require utilization review.



Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
hospital’s participation in the federal health care
programs may be terminated, or civil or criminal penalties may
be imposed under certain provisions of the Social Security Act,
or both.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
“Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care
program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly.
Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a
criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or
imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of
the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal
health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.

The Office of Inspector General at HHS (“OIG”), among
other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. As one means of providing guidance to health
care providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
of arrangements or transactions that may indicate that the
arrangements or transactions violate the Anti-kickback Statute
or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified
several incentive arrangements, which, if accompanied by
inappropriate intent, constitute suspect practices, including:
(a) payment of any incentive by the hospital each time a
physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of
free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in
facilities usually located close to the hospital,
(c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing,
nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a
physician’s office staff in areas such as management
techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which
provide that, if the physician’s income fails to reach a
predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the
remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or
loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to
the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a
physician’s travel and expenses for conferences,
(h) coverage on the hospital’s group health insurance
plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician,
(i) payment for services (which may include consultations
at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties
by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from
physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value,
(k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than
fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which
physicians refer, and (l) certain “gainsharing”
arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of
any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care
attributable in part to the physician’s efforts. The OIG
has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who
offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such
information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a
means of providing guidance to health care providers. These
bulletins, along with the “Special Fraud Alerts,” have
focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to
heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities,
including contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
venture arrangements between those in a position to refer
business, such as physicians, and those providing items or
services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays.

In addition to issuing fraud alerts and special advisory
bulletins, the OIG from time to time issues compliance program
guidance for certain types of health care providers. In January
2005, the OIG published Supplemental Compliance Guidance for
Hospitals, supplementing its 1998 guidance for the hospital
industry. In the supplemental guidance, the OIG identifies a
number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and
regulations. These areas of risk include compensation
arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with
physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
regulations that outline categories of activities that are
deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
Statute. Currently, there are



statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities,
including the following: investment interests, space rental,
equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services
and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services,
warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing
organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible
amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice
insurance subsidies, investments in group practices,
freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and
referral agreements for specialty services. The fact that
conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe
harbor, or that it is identified in a fraud alert or as a risk
area in the Supplemental Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals,
does not automatically render the conduct or business
arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However,
such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased
scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. Although the
Company believes that its arrangements with physicians have been
structured to comply with current law and available
interpretations, there can be no assurance that regulatory
authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial
arrangements do not violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other
applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject the
Company to liabilities under the Social Security Act, including
criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from
participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care
programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
as the “Stark Law.” This law effectively prohibits
physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to
entities with which they or any of their immediate family
members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide
certain designated health services that are reimbursable by
Medicare, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services.
Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment,
refunding amounts received for services provided pursuant to
prohibited referrals, civil monetary penalties of up to
$15,000 per prohibited service provided, and exclusion from
the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The statute also provides
for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a circumvention scheme.
There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many
of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and
providers, including employment contracts, leases and
recruitment agreements. There is also an exception for a
physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital, as
opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department.

CMS has issued two phases of final regulations implementing the
Stark Law, which became effective on January 4, 2002 and
July 26, 2004, respectively. While these regulations help
clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it
is unclear how the government will interpret them for
enforcement purposes.

In 2003, Congress passed legislation that modified the hospital
ownership exception to the Stark Law by creating an

18-month

moratorium on
allowing physicians to own interests in new specialty hospitals.
During the moratorium, HHS was required to conduct an analysis
of specialty hospitals, including quality of care provided and
physician referral patterns to these facilities. MedPAC was also
required to study cost and payment issues related to specialty
hospitals. The moratorium applied to hospitals that primarily or
exclusively treat cardiac, orthopedic or surgical conditions or
any other specialized category of patients or cases designated
by regulation, unless the hospitals were in operation or
development before November 18, 2003, did not increase the
number of physician investors, and met certain other
requirements. The moratorium expired on June 8, 2005. In
March 2005, MedPAC issued its report on specialty hospitals, in
which it recommended that Congress extend the moratorium until
January 1, 2007, modify payments to hospitals to reflect
more closely the cost of care, and allow certain types of
gainsharing arrangements. In May 2005, HHS issued the required
report of its analysis of specialty hospitals in which it
recommended reforming certain inpatient hospital services and
ambulatory surgery center services payment rates that may
currently encourage the establishment of specialty hospitals and
implementation of closer scrutiny of the processes for approving
new specialty hospitals for participation in Medicare. Further,
HHS suspended processing new provider enrollment applications
for specialty hospitals until January 2006, creating in effect a
moratorium on new specialty hospitals. DEFRA 2005, signed into
law February 8, 2006, directed HHS to extend this
enrollment suspension until the earlier of six months from the
enactment of DEFRA 2005 or the release of a report regarding
physician owned specialty hospitals by HHS.



Similar State Laws

Many states in which HCA operates also have laws that prohibit
payments to physicians for patient referrals similar to the
Anti-kickback Statute and self-referral legislation similar to
the Stark Law. The scope of these state laws is broad, since
they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for
care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or
enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and
civil penalties as well as loss of facility licensure.

HIPAA and BBA-97

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of certain fraud and
abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care
fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. HIPAA
also added a prohibition against incentives intended to
influence decisions by Medicare beneficiaries as to the provider
from which they will receive services. In addition, HIPAA
created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse,
including the Medicare Integrity Program, and an incentive
program under which individuals can receive up to $1,000 for
providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to
the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds. Federal
enforcement officials now have the ability to exclude from
Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing
employees associated with business entities that have committed
health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had
no knowledge of the fraud. HIPAA was followed by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 (“BBA-97”), which created
additional fraud and abuse provisions, including civil penalties
for contracting with an individual or entity that the provider
knows or should know is excluded from a federal health care
program.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil
penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and
Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing
for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
unnecessary goods and services, and cost report fraud. Criminal
and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other
prohibited activities, including failure to return known
overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, and offering
remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid
beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider. Like the
Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Careful
and accurate coding of claims for reimbursement, as well as
accurately preparing cost reports, must be performed to avoid
liability.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

A factor affecting the health care industry is the use of the
federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought by
individuals on the government’s behalf under the False
Claims Act’s

“qui tam,”

or
whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow
private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government
alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government.

When a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable
under the False Claims Act, the defendant may be required to pay
three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus
mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each
separate false claim. There are many potential bases for
liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises
when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement
to the federal government. The False Claims Act defines the term
“knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence will not
give rise to liability under the False Claims Act, submitting a
claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
constitutes a “knowing” submission under the False
Claims Act and, therefore, will qualify for liability.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have
taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated
other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark
Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the False Claims
Act. A number of states in which HCA operates have adopted their
own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower
provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in
state court.



HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy
    Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
received electronically. These provisions are intended to
encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
became mandatory for HCA’s facilities in October 2003,
although CMS accepted noncompliant claims through
September 30, 2005. HHS recently proposed a rule that would
establish standards for electronic health care claims
attachments. We believe that the cost of compliance with these
regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of
operations.

HIPAA also requires HHS to adopt standards to protect the
privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related
information. HHS issued regulations containing privacy standards
and compliance with these regulations became mandatory during
April 2003. The privacy regulations regulate the use and
disclosure of individually identifiable health-related
information, whether communicated electronically, on paper or
orally. The regulations also provide patients with significant
new rights related to understanding and controlling how their
health information is used or disclosed. HHS released final
security regulations that became mandatory during April 2005 and
require health care providers to implement administrative,
physical and technical practices to protect the security of
individually identifiable health information that is maintained
or transmitted electronically. The privacy regulations and
security regulations have and will continue to impose
significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with
these standards.

Violations of HIPAA could result in civil penalties of up to
$25,000 per type of violation in each calendar year and
criminal penalties of up to $250,000 per violation. In
addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory
initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing patient
privacy concerns. Facilities will continue to remain subject to
any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more
restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA.
These statutes vary and could impose additional penalties.

EMTALA

All of HCA’s hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical
Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This
federal law requires any hospital that participates in the
Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every individual who presents to the
hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the
individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to
either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer
of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition.
The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical
conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to
pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a
hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer
an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary
penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare
program. In addition, an injured individual, the
individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a
financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s
violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s
emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to
individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government also
has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA
violations actively in the future. We believe our hospitals
operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws that prohibit
corporations and other entities from employing physicians and
practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct
and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between
health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage
the



referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular
providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions
for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and
civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between
the corporation and the physician may be considered void and
unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are
often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or
regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
years on the hospital industry. While we are currently not aware
of any material investigations of the Company, under federal or
state health care laws or regulations, it is possible that
governmental entities could initiate investigations or
litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such
matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse
publicity. It is also possible that HCA’s executives and
managers could be included in governmental investigations or
litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.

The Company’s substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other
governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of its
operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business
and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program
that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines
and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex
and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or
litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent
with industry practices, including the Company’s.

In public statements surrounding current investigations,
governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
issues, including some for which little official interpretation
previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent
with practices that have been common within the industry and
that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some
instances, government investigations that have in the past been
conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be
conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their
focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement
efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of
Justice have, from time to time, established national
enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers, that
focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of
abuse. Further, under the federal False Claims Act, private
parties have the right to bring

“qui tam”

whistleblower lawsuits against companies that submit false
claims for payments to the government. Some states have adopted
similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and
state investigations relate to a wide variety of routine health
care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices,
including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with
referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician
joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices
for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health
care operations and other activities that could be the subject
of governmental investigations or inquiries from time to time.
For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings,
we have numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are
referral sources to our hospitals and we have joint venture
arrangements involving physician investors. Any additional
investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could
result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as
adverse publicity.

Health Care Reform

Health care is one of the largest industries in the United
States and continues to attract much legislative interest and
public attention. In recent years, various legislative proposals
have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state
legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care
system, either nationally or at the state level. Many states
have enacted, or are considering enacting, measures designed to
reduce their Medicaid expenditures and change private health
care insurance. DEFRA 2005, signed into law on February 8,
2006, included Medicaid cuts of approximately $4.8 billion
over five years. In addition, proposed regulatory changes would,
if implemented, reduce federal Medicaid funding by an additional
$12.2 billion over five years. Most states, including the
states in which HCA operates, have applied for and



have been granted federal waivers from current Medicaid
regulations to allow them to serve some or all of their Medicaid
participants through managed care providers.

Compliance Program and Corporate Integrity Agreement

HCA maintains a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we
provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees
and encourage all employees to report any violations to their
supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
telephone ethics line.

In January 2001, HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate
Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the OIG. The CIA is
structured to assure the federal government of our overall
federal health care program compliance and specifically covers
DRG coding, outpatient PPS billing and physician relations. The
CIA also included testing for outpatient laboratory billing in
2001, which was replaced with skilled nursing facilities billing
in 2003. Under the CIA, we have an affirmative obligation to
report potential violations of applicable federal heath care
laws and regulations and have, pursuant to this obligation,
reported a number of potential violations of the Stark, EMTALA
and other laws, most of which we consider to be technical
violations. This obligation could result in greater scrutiny by
regulatory authorities. Breach of the CIA could subject us to
substantial monetary penalties and/or exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can
result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe
we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but there
can be no assurance that a review of our practices by courts or
regulatory authorities will not result in a determination that
could adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

HCA is subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment. Management does not believe that we will be
required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with
these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially
affect our capital expenditures, results of operations or
financial condition.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, HCA is subject to
claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
business. Through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, we insure
a substantial portion of our professional liability risks. Our
facilities are insured by the insurance subsidiary for losses of
up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary
has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks
generally above a rentention level of $15 million per
occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance
with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. HCA and its
insurance subsidiary maintain reserves for professional
liability risks (net of $43 million receivable under
reinsurance contracts) that totaled $1.578 billion at
December 31, 2005. Management considers such reserves,
which are based on actuarially determined estimates, to be
adequate for such liability risks.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for
directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts
that we believe are adequate. The directors and officers
liability coverage includes a $25 million corporate
deductible. The property coverage includes varying deductibles
depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles
range from $500,000 per claim up to 5% of the affected
property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake
related incidents.



Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2005, HCA had approximately 191,100
employees, including approximately 51,300 part-time
employees. References herein to “employees” refer to
employees of affiliates of HCA. HCA is subject to various state
and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other
terms and conditions relating to employment. Employees at 16
hospitals are represented by various labor unions. We consider
our employee relations to be satisfactory. Our hospitals are
experiencing some union organizational activity, and we
anticipate that we will have elections at six hospitals in
Florida in the second quarter of 2006, and an election at one
hospital in Nevada in the fourth quarter of 2006. However, we do
not expect such efforts to materially affect our future
operations. HCA’s hospitals, like most hospitals, have
experienced labor costs rising faster than the general inflation
rate. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel
availability has become a significant operating issue to health
care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented
several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting,
compensation programs and productivity. This shortage may also
require an increase in the utilization of more expensive
temporary personnel.

Licensed physicians, who have been accepted to the medical staff
of individual hospitals, staff our hospitals. With certain
exceptions, physicians generally are not employees of our
hospitals. However, some physicians provide services in our
hospitals under contracts which generally describe a term of
service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of
such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance
criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed
physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any
of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the
appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with
established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to
the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often
also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may
terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any
time.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Risk Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors
were to occur, HCA’s business, financial position, results
of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also
constrain its business and operations. In either case, the
trading price of our common stock could decline and stockholders
could lose all or part of their investment.

Our Hospitals Face Competition For Patients From Other
    Hospitals And Health Care Providers.

The health care business is highly competitive and competition
among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
local communities served by most of our hospitals provide
services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In 2005, CMS
began making public performance data related to ten quality
measures that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare
reimbursement. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or
results that are lower than our competitors) on these ten
quality measures, patient volumes could decline. In the future,
other trends toward clinical transparency may have an
unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient
volumes. In addition, the number of freestanding specialty
hospitals, surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in
the geographic areas in which we operate has increased
significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
highly competitive environment. Some of the hospitals that
compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or
not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable
contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital
expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. We are facing
increasing competition from physician-owned specialty hospitals
and freestanding surgery centers for market share in high margin
services and for quality physicians and personnel. If our
competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit
physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care
contracts at their facilities, we may experience a decline in
patient volume. See Item 1, “Business —
Competition.”



Section 507 of MMA provided for an

18-month

moratorium on
the establishment of new specialty hospitals. Congress also
required that MedPAC and HHS conduct studies on specialty
hospitals with reports to be completed no later than
15 months after the date of enactment of MMA. The
moratorium expired on June 8, 2005. In March 2005, MedPAC
issued its report on specialty hospitals, in which it
recommended that Congress extend the moratorium until
January 1, 2007, modify payments to hospitals to reflect
more closely the cost of care, and allow certain types of
gainsharing arrangements. In May 2005, HHS issued the required
report of its analysis of specialty hospitals in which it
recommended reforming certain inpatient hospital services and
ambulatory surgery center services payment rates that may
currently encourage the establishment of specialty hospitals and
implementation of closer scrutiny of the processes for approving
new specialty hospitals for participation in Medicare. Further,
HHS suspended processing new provider enrollment applications
for specialty hospitals until January 2006, creating in effect a
moratorium on new specialty hospitals. DEFRA 2005 directed HHS
to extend this enrollment suspension until the earlier of six
months from the enactment of DEFRA 2005 or the release of a
report regarding physician owned specialty hospitals by HHS. We
cannot predict whether the moratorium will be extended beyond
this date. If the moratorium expires, we may face additional
competition from an increased number of specialty hospitals,
including hospitals owned by physicians currently on staff at
our hospitals.

The Growth Of Uninsured And Patient Due Accounts And A
    Deterioration In The Collectibility Of These Accounts Could
    Adversely Affect Our Results Of Operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate
to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which
the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by
the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
(deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly
from patients.

On December 29, 2004, CMS issued guidance that has enabled
hospitals to provide discounts to any uninsured patient without
placing the hospital’s Medicare payments at risk. Based on
this guidance, in 2005 we implemented modifications to our
self-pay policies, the effect of which was to provide a discount
to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
care. These discounts are similar to those provided to many
local managed care plans. In implementing the discount policy,
hospitals first attempt to qualify uninsured patients for
Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care. If
an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
uninsured discount is applied.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in federal and state governmental and private employer
health care coverage and other collection indicators. At
December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts
represented approximately 85% of the $3.404 billion patient
due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of
estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which
eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated
(“pending Medicaid accounts”). For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the provision for doubtful accounts
decreased to 9.6% of revenues compared to 11.4% of revenues in
2004. Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured discount policy
implemented January 1, 2005, the provision for doubtful
accounts was 12.4% of revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these
accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts
receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

Changes In Governmental Programs May Reduce Our Revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volumes is derived from
government health care programs, principally Medicare and
Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and
substantial changes. We derived approximately 53% of our
admissions from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2005. In
recent years, legislative changes have resulted in limitations
on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to
health care providers for certain services under these
government programs.



Congress has directed MedPAC to make recommendations regarding
the levels of payments to health care providers under the
Medicare program. For inpatient services for fiscal year 2007,
MedPAC has recommended that Congress update inpatient PPS
payments by the market basket minus 0.45 percentage points.
For outpatient services for calendar year 2007, MedPAC has
recommended that Congress update outpatient PPS payments by the
market basket minus 0.45 percentage points. It is uncertain
whether Congress will adopt these recommendations. If Congress
adopts these recommendations, HCA’s revenues may be
reduced. Other Medicare payment changes may also reduce
HCA’s revenues. See Item 1, “Business —
Sources of Revenue.”

A number of states are experiencing budget problems and have
adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce
their Medicaid expenditures. DEFRA 2005, signed into law on
February 8, 2006, includes Medicaid cuts of approximately
$4.8 billion over five years. In addition, proposed
regulatory changes, if implemented, would reduce federal
Medicaid funding by an additional $12.2 billion over five
years. States have also adopted, or are considering, legislation
designed to reduce coverage and program eligibility, enroll
Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose
additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the
states’ Medicaid systems. Hospital operating margins have
been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because
of deterioration in pricing flexibility and payer mix, and
growth in operating expenses in excess of the increase in PPS
payments under the Medicare program. Future legislation or other
changes in the administration or interpretation of government
health programs could have a material, adverse effect on our
financial position and results of operations.

Demands Of Nongovernment Payers May Adversely Affect Our
    Growth In Revenues.

Our ability to negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment
payers, including managed care plans, significantly affects the
revenues and operating results of most of our hospitals.
Admissions derived from managed care and other insurers
accounted for approximately 42% of our admissions in 2005.
Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers,
increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures. Reductions
in price increases or the amounts received from managed care,
commercial insurance or other payers could have a material,
adverse effect on our financial position and results of
operations.

Our Performance Depends On Our Ability To Recruit And Retain
    Quality Physicians.

Physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions
and, therefore, the success of our hospitals depend, in part, on
the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs
of our hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians
and maintaining good relations with those physicians. Physicians
are generally not employees of the hospitals at which they
practice and, in many of the markets that HCA serves, most
physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in
addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their
affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If we are unable to
provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced
equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those
physicians, they may be discouraged from referring patients to
our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating
performance may decline.

If We Fail To Comply With Extensive Laws And Government
    Regulations, We Could Suffer Penalties Or Be Required To Make
    Significant Changes To Our Operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local
government levels relating to, among other things:



Among these laws are the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark
Law. These laws impact the relationships that we may have with
physicians and other referral sources. We have a variety of
financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to
our hospitals, including employment contracts, leases and
professional service agreements. We also provide financial
incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit
physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. The OIG
has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices that
are deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback
Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe
harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint
ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other
referral sources, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.
Failure to meet a safe harbor does not mean that the arrangement
necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute, but may subject
the arrangement to greater scrutiny. We cannot assure that
practices that are outside of a safe harbor will not be found to
violate the Anti-kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with physicians and their immediate
family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an
exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an
exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the
exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that
every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the
Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the
Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such
violation is technical in nature.

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be
subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil
penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or
more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from
participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and
state health care programs. See Item 1,
“Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

Because many of these laws and their implementation regulations
are relatively new, we do not always have the benefit of
significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws
and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or
enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our
current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
illegality, or could require us to make changes in our
facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure
programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have
violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are
being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could
have a material adverse effect our business, financial
condition, results of operations or prospects and our business
reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we are
unable to predict whether other legislation or regulations at
the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such
legislation or regulations may take or their impact.

Our Hospitals Face Competition For Staffing, Which May
    Increase Labor Costs And Reduce Profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and
experience of our management and medical support personnel, such
as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our
physicians. We compete with other health care providers in
recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
other medical support personnel has become a significant
operating issue to health care providers. This shortage may
require us to continue to enhance



wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other
medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary
personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of
semiskilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in
which we operate. In addition, to the extent that a significant
portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize,
our labor costs could increase. If our labor costs increase, we
may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs.
Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of
fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased
labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain
qualified management, nurses and other medical support
personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material,
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We Have Been The Subject Of Governmental Investigations,
    Claims And Litigation That Have Resulted In Significant Charges
    And Ongoing Reporting Obligations.

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware that we were the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
we entered into an eight-year CIA with the OIG. If we were found
to be in violation of the CIA, we could be subject to
substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties and/or
exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs. Any such sanctions or expenses could have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
and liquidity.

In September 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York
seeking the production of documents. Also in September 2005, we
were informed that the SEC had issued a formal order of
investigation. Both the subpoena and the formal order of
investigation relate to trading in our securities. We are
cooperating fully with these investigations.

Subsequently, HCA and certain of our executive officers and
directors were named in various federal securities law class
actions and several shareholders have filed derivative lawsuits
purportedly on behalf of the Company. Additionally, a former
employee of HCA filed a complaint against certain of our
executive officers pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act and we have been served with a shareholder demand
letter addressed to our Board of Directors. We cannot predict
the results of the investigations or any related lawsuits or the
effect that findings in such investigations or lawsuits adverse
to us may have on us. These proceedings are described in greater
detail in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”

Controls Designed To Reduce Inpatient Services May Reduce Our
    Revenues.

Controls imposed by third-party payers designed to reduce
admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
“utilization review,” have affected and are expected
to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails
the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient
by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of
stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by
payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review
and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to
continue. Although we are unable to predict the effect these
changes will have on our operations, significant limits on the
scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees
could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

Our Operations Could Be Impaired By A Failure Of Our
    Information Systems.

The performance of our sophisticated information technology and
systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to
our shared services initiatives, our information systems are
essential to a number of critical areas of our operations,
including:



•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management; and

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts
    and supply contracts.

We are in the process of implementing projects to replace our
payroll and human resources information systems. Management
estimates that the payroll and human resources system projects
will require total expenditures of approximately
$332 million to develop and install. At December 31,
2005,

project-to

-date
costs incurred were $278 million ($158 million of the
costs incurred have been capitalized and $120 million have
been expensed). Management expects that the system development,
testing, data conversion and installation will continue through
2006. There can be no assurance that the development and
implementation of those systems will not be delayed, that the
total cost will not be significantly more than currently
anticipated, that business processes will not be interrupted
during implementation or that we will realize the expected
benefits and efficiencies from the developed products.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or
delay the collection of revenue. Even though we have implemented
network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to
computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from
unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any of these events
could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of
data, or cessations in the availability of systems, all of which
could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position
and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

State Efforts To Regulate The Construction Or Expansion Of
    Hospitals Could Impair Our Ability To Operate And Expand Our
    Operations.

Some states require health care providers to obtain prior
approval, known as a certificate of need, or CON, for the
purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities,
to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in
services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states
consider the need for additional or expanded health care
facilities or services. We currently operate hospitals in a
number of states with CON laws. The failure to obtain any
requested CON could impair our ability to operate or expand
operations.

Our Facilities Are Heavily Concentrated In Florida And Texas,
    Which Makes Us Sensitive To Regulatory, Economic, Environmental
    And Competitive Changes In Those States.

HCA operated 182 hospitals at December 31, 2005, and 74 of
those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. This situation
makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic,
environmental and competition changes in those states.

Any material change in the current payment programs or
regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in
those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall
business results.

In addition, both Florida and Texas are located in
hurricane-prone areas. In the recent past, hurricanes have had a
disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida,
Texas, and other coastal states, and the patient populations in
those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a
particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm.

We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims By The IRS.

HCA is currently contesting claims for income taxes, interest
and penalties proposed by the IRS for prior years aggregating
approximately $776 million through December 31, 2005.
The disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of the
2001 government settlement payment, the timing of recognition of
certain patient service revenues in 2000 through 2002, the
method for calculating the tax allowance for uncollectible
accounts in 2002, and the amount of insurance expense deducted
in 1999 through 2002.

During February 2006, the IRS began an examination of our 2003
through 2004 federal income tax returns. The IRS has not
determined the amount of any additional income tax, interest and
penalties that it



may claim upon completion of this examination or any future
examinations that may be initiated. See Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — IRS
Disputes.”

We May Be Subject To Liabilities From Claims Brought Against
    Our Facilities.

HCA is subject to litigation relating to our business practices,
including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
liability or other legal theories. See Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings.” Many of these actions involve large claims
and significant defense costs. We insure a substantial portion
of our professional liability risks through a wholly-owned
subsidiary. Management believes our insurance coverage is
sufficient to cover claims arising out of the operation of our
facilities. HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has
entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and the obligations
covered by the reinsurance contracts are included in its
reserves for professional liability risks, as the subsidiary
remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet
their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments
for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not
covered by insurance or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their
obligations, our results of operations and financial position
could be adversely affected.

We Are Exposed to Market Risks Related to Changes in the
    Market Values of Securities and Interest Rate Changes

HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes in market
values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
$1.419 billion and $965 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2005. These investments are carried at fair
value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair
value of investments is generally based on quoted market prices.
If the insurance subsidiary were to experience significant
declines in the fair value of its investments, this could
require additional investment by us to allow the insurance
subsidiary to satisfy its minimum capital requirements. At
December 31, 2005, we had a net unrealized gain of $184
million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment securities.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
interest rates, and periodically enter into interest rate swap
agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our
interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on
common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts and interest payments in these agreements match
the cash flows of the related liabilities. The notional amounts
of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the
exchange of cash flows and are not assets or liabilities of HCA.
Any market risk or opportunity associated with these swap
agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the
related debt. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
financial institutions. See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Market Risk”.

Fluctuations In Operating Results And Other Factors May
    Result In Decreases In Our Stock Price.

There is significant volatility in the market price of
HCA’s common stock. If we are unable to operate our
hospitals as profitably as we have in the past, investors could
sell shares of HCA’s common stock when it becomes apparent
that the expectations of the market may not be realized,
resulting in a decrease in the market price of HCA’s common
stock.

In addition to our operating results, the operating results of
other hospital companies, changes in financial estimates or
recommendations by analysts, changes in government health care
programs, governmental investigations and litigation,
speculation in the press or investment community, the possible
effects of war, terrorist and other hostilities, adverse weather
conditions, the level of seasonal illnesses, changes in general
conditions in the economy or the financial markets, or other
developments affecting the health care industry, could cause
substantial fluctuations in the market price of our common stock.



We Have Increased Leverage As A Result Of Financing Our
    Recently Completed “Dutch” Auction Tender Offer.

In October 2005, we commenced a modified “Dutch”
auction tender offer to purchase up to $2.5 billion of our
common stock. To finance the tender offer, we used approximately
$600 million of cash on hand and borrowed $800 million
under a $1.0 billion short term loan facility. In
connection with the tender offer, we amended our existing
revolving credit facility and the related senior term loan to
modify the compliance levels for our required ratio of
consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization.
Our total long-term debt, including amounts due within one year,
was $10.475 billion at December 31, 2005. In February
2006, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.5% notes due in February
2016. The proceeds from the notes and the proceeds from the
sales of hospitals were used to repay amounts under the
$800 million term loan and to pay down amounts advanced
under the existing revolving credit facility. The authorization
permits us to repurchase additional shares in an amount up to
the remainder of the $2.5 billion authorization from time
to time through open market purchases, or in private or other
transactions. During 2005, we repurchased 8.0 million
shares of our common stock for $412 million through open
market purchases. See Item 7, “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources” and
“— Market Risk” and Note 8 —
Long-Term Debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements
for additional information on our debt obligations.

We may continue to make borrowings under our existing revolving
credit facility, and we have issued debt securities, from time
to time, including $1.0 billion of 6.5% Notes due 2016
issued in February 2006. We may issue additional debt securities
in the future. Our ability to make payments on our debt and fund
planned capital expenditures and the operation of our business
will depend on cash flow from operations, amounts available
under our existing revolving credit facility and our access to
public and private debt markets. Our increased debt service
obligations could, among other things:

Item 2.

Properties

The following table lists, by state, the number of hospitals
(general, acute care, psychiatric and rehabilitation) directly
or indirectly owned and operated by the Company as of
December 31, 2005:

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we
directly or indirectly operate 94 freestanding surgery centers.
We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with
some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately
919,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain
service centers related to our shared services initiatives.
These service centers are located in markets in which we operate
hospitals.

HCA’s headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various
federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating
their operation. Management does not believe that compliance
with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our
financial position or results of operations.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
asserted against the Company. The resolution of any such
lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could
materially, adversely affect our results of operations and
financial position in a given period.

Government Investigation, Claims and Litigation

Commencing in 1997, we became aware we were the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
we entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services. Violation or breach of
the CIA, or other violation of federal or state laws relating to
Medicare, Medicaid or similar programs, could subject the
Company to substantial monetary fines, civil and criminal
penalties and/or exclusion from participation in the Medicare
and Medicaid programs. Alleged violations may be pursued by the
government or through private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions
imposed against us as a result of such actions could have a
material, adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial position.

Governmental Investigations

In September 2005, we received a subpoena from the Office of the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York
seeking the production of documents. Also in September 2005, we
were informed that the SEC had issued a formal order of
investigation. Both the subpoena and the formal order of
investigation relate to trading in our securities. We are
cooperating fully with these investigations.

Securities Class Action Litigation

In November 2005, two putative federal securities law class
actions were filed in the United States District Court for the
Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of persons who purchased
our stock between January 12, 2005 and July 13, 2005.
These substantially similar lawsuits assert claims pursuant to
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, against us and
our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief
Operating Officer, and Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, related to our July 13, 2005
announcement of preliminary results of operations for the second
quarter ended June 30, 2005.

On January 4, 2006, the court consolidated these actions
under the caption

In re HCA Inc. Securities Litigation

,
case number 3:05-CV-00981

.

Pursuant to federal statute,
on January 25, 2006, the court appointed co-lead plaintiffs
to represent the interests of the putative class members in this
litigation. Co-lead plaintiffs must file a consolidated amended
complaint no later than March 27, 2006. We believe that the
allegations contained within these class action lawsuits are
without merit and intend to vigorously defend the litigation.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits in Federal Court

In November 2005, two current shareholders each filed a
derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of the Company, in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of
Tennessee against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
President and Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer, other executives, and certain
members of our Board of Directors. Each lawsuit asserts claims
for breaches of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross
mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment
in connection with the Company’s July 13, 2005
announcement of preliminary results of operations for the
quarter ended June 30, 2005.

On January 23, 2006, the court consolidated these actions
as

In re HCA Inc. Derivative Litigation

, lead case number
3:05-CV-0968, and ordered that a consolidated derivative
complaint be filed no later than March 24, 2006.



On December 27, 2005, we were served with a shareholder
demand letter demanding that our Board of Directors take action
to remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duty by certain of our
directors and executive officers. The letter claims that certain
officers and directors knew, but failed to publicly disclose,
certain matters concerning trends relating to uninsured patient
accounts receivable.

Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit in State Court

On January 18, 2006, a current shareholder filed a
derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of the Company, in the
Circuit Court for the State of Tennessee (Nashville District),
against our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and
Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, other executives, and certain members of our
Board of Directors. This lawsuit is substantially identical to
the previously described “Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits
in Federal Court,” in all material respects. Although the
action has been filed, the plaintiff has not yet served the
complaint on the named defendants.

ERISA Litigation

On November 22, 2005, Brenda Thurman, a former employee of
an HCA affiliate, filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on behalf of
herself, the HCA Savings and Retirement Program (the
“Plan”), and a class of participants in the Plan who
held an interest in our common stock, against our Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer,
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and other
unnamed individuals. The lawsuit, filed under sections 502(a)(2)
and 502(a)(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
(“ERISA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 1132(a)(2) and (3),
alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties owed to
the Plan and to plan participants.

On January 13, 2006, the court signed an order staying all
proceedings and discovery in this matter, pending resolution of
a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint in the
related federal securities class action against HCA. On
January 18, 2006, the magistrate judge signed an order
(i) consolidating Thurman’s cause of action with all
other future actions making the same claims and arising out of
the same operative facts, (ii) appointing Thurman as lead
plaintiff, and (iii) appointing Thurman’s attorneys as
lead counsel and liaison counsel in the case. On
January 26, 2006, the court issued an order reassigning the
case to United States District Court Judge William J. Haynes,
Jr., who has been presiding over the federal securities class
action and federal derivative lawsuits.

General Liability and Other Claims

The Company is a party to certain proceedings relating to claims
for income taxes and related interest in the United States Tax
Court, and the United States Court of Federal Claims. For a
description of those proceedings, see Note 4 —
Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which
may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management,
the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our
results of operations or financial position.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during
the fourth quarter of 2005.



PART II

Item 5.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related
    Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities

HCA’s common stock is traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the “NYSE”) (symbol “HCA”).
The table below sets forth, for the calendar quarters indicated,
the high and low sales prices per share reported on the NYSE
composite tape for our common stock.

At the close of business on February 28, 2006, there were
approximately 12,400 holders of record of our common stock and
one holder of record of our nonvoting common stock.

In January 2005, our Board of Directors approved an increase in
our quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to
$0.15 per share. The Board declared the initial
$0.15 per share dividend payable on June 1, 2005 to
shareholders of record at May 1, 2005. In January 2006, our
Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly
dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.17 per share. The
Board declared the initial $0.17 per share dividend payable
on June 1, 2006 to shareholders of record at May 1,
2006. The declaration and payment of future dividends will
depend upon many factors, including earnings, financial
position, business needs, capital and surplus and regulatory
considerations.

On October 13, 2005, we announced the authorization of a
modified “Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up
to $2.500 billion of our common stock. In November 2005, we
closed the tender offer and repurchased 28.7 million shares
for an aggregate purchase price of $1.437 billion
($50.00 per share). We are authorized to repurchase
additional shares in an amount up to the remainder of the
$2.5 billion authorization through open market purchases or
in private or other transactions. As of December 31, 2005,
we had repurchased 8.0 million additional shares for $412
million pursuant to the authorization. This table provides
certain information as of December 31, 2005 with respect to
our repurchases of our common stock.

2005 Operations Summary

Net income totaled $1.424 billion, or $3.19 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to $1.246 billion, or $2.58 per diluted
share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The 2005
results include gains on sales of facilities of
$78 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, reductions to
estimated professional liability reserves of $83 million,
or $0.12 per diluted share, a favorable tax settlement of
$48 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, and a tax
benefit of $24 million, or $0.05 per diluted share,
related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. During 2005, we
incurred expenses, net of recoveries, associated with hurricanes
of $60 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. The 2004
results include a favorable change in the estimated provision
for doubtful accounts totaling $46 million, or
$0.06 per diluted share, based upon refinements to the
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation process related to
estimated recoveries associated with Medicare copays and
deductibles and collection agency placements, and a
$59 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, reduction to
the estimated professional liability insurance reserves. During
2004, we incurred expenses, net of recoveries, associated with
hurricanes of $40 million, or $0.05 per diluted share
and recognized an asset impairment charge of $12 million,
or $0.02 per diluted share. We repurchased
36.7 million shares of our common stock during the fourth
quarter of 2005 and 62.9 million shares of our common stock
during the fourth quarter of 2004. Shares used for diluted
earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2005
were 445.8 million shares, compared to 483.7 million
shares for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Same facility revenue per equivalent admission increased 3.2%
for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year
ended December 31, 2004. Our uninsured discount policy,
which became effective January 1, 2005, resulted in
$756 million in same facility discounts to the uninsured
being recorded during 2005. Adjusting for the effect of the
uninsured discounts, same facility revenue per equivalent
admission increased 6.5% for the year ended December 31,
2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. See
“Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures, Operating Measures
Adjusted for the Impact of Discounts for the Uninsured.”

During the year ended December 31, 2005, same facility
admissions increased 0.1%, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2004. Same facility inpatient surgeries
increased 0.9% and same facility outpatient surgeries increased
0.3% during the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2004.

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the provision for
doubtful accounts declined to 9.6% of revenues from 11.4% of
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004. Adjusting
for the effect of the uninsured discounts, the provision for
doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
12.4% of revenues. Same facility uninsured admissions increased
9.5% and same facility uninsured emergency room visits increased
11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2004.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve high
quality, cost-effective, health care while maintaining
consistency with our ethics and compliance program, governmental
regulations and guidelines, and industry standards. As a part of
this strategy, management focuses on the following areas:

•

Commitment to the care and improvement of human life:

Our
    foundation is built on putting patients first and providing
    quality health care services in the communities we serve. We
    continue to increase efforts and funding for our patient safety
    agenda. Management believes patient outcomes will increasingly
    influence physician and patient choices concerning health care
    delivery.

•

Commitment to ethics and compliance:

We are committed to
    a corporate culture highlighted by the following
    values — compassion, honesty, integrity, fairness,
    loyalty, respect and kindness. Our comprehensive ethics and
    compliance program reinforces our dedication to these values.

Business Strategy (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical
experience and various other assumptions that we believe are
reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on
an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related
disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes
known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe that the following critical accounting policies
affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates (Continued)

Revenues (Continued)

Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to
interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on
a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best
information available regarding management’s interpretation
of the applicable laws, regulations and contract terms.
Management continually reviews the contractual estimation
process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and
regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual
terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals. We
have invested significant resources to refine and improve the
computerized billing system and the information system data used
to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed
standardized calculation processes and related training programs
to improve the utility of the patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
financially unable to pay for the health care services they
receive.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
meet the Company’s guidelines to qualify as charity care;
therefore, they are not reported in revenues. The revenues
associated with uninsured patients who do not meet our
guidelines to qualify as charity care have generally been
reported in revenues at gross charges. Patients treated at our
hospitals for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200%
of the federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
federal poverty level is established by the federal government
and is based on income and family size. On January 1, 2005,
we modified our policies to provide discounts to uninsured
patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These
discounts are similar to those provided to many local managed
care plans.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and
documentation of health care services authorized and provided,
the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement
are often subject to interpretations that could result in
payments that are different from our estimates. A hypothetical
1% change in net receivables that are subject to contractual
discounts at December 31, 2005 would result in an impact on
pretax earnings of approximately $29 million.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for
    Doubtful Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
primary source of cash and is critical to our operating
performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured
patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the
primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
(deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all
uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts.
Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and
external collection efforts have been performed. We consider the
return of an account from the primary external collection agency
to be the culmination of our reasonable collection efforts and
the timing basis for writing off the account balance. Writeoffs
are based upon specific identification and the writeoff process
requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting
system. We do not pursue

and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (Continued)

collection of amounts related to patients that meet our
guidelines to qualify as charity care. Charity care is not
reported in revenues and does not have an impact on the
provision for doubtful accounts.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on
the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and
recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating
the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-month
accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. At
December 31, 2005, the allowance for doubtful accounts
represented approximately 85% of the $3.404 billion patient
due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of the
related estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
which eligibility for Medicaid assistance or charity was being
evaluated (“pending Medicaid accounts”). At
December 31, 2004, the allowance for doubtful accounts
represented approximately 87% of the $3.382 billion patient
due accounts receivable balance, including pending Medicaid
accounts, net of the related estimated contractual discounts
(the December 31, 2004 allowance for doubtful accounts
represented approximately 78% of the $3.762 billion patient
due accounts receivable balance, including pending Medicaid
accounts, but excluding the related estimated contractual
discounts). The provision for doubtful accounts decreased to
9.6% of revenues for 2005, from 11.4% of revenues for 2004 and
from 10.1% of revenues in 2003. Our uninsured discount policy,
which became effective January 1, 2005, resulted in
$769 million in discounts to the uninsured being recorded
during 2005. Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured
discounts, the provision for doubtful accounts increased to
12.4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. See
“Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures, Operating Measures
Adjusted for the Impact of Discounts for the Uninsured.”
Days revenues in accounts receivable were 50 days,
48 days and 52 days at December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the
challenges related to the collection of the patient due
accounts. Adverse changes in general economic conditions,
patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or
trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable,
cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payer
classification as of December 31, 2005 and 2004 is set
forth in the following table:

The decline in uninsured accounts receivable from 62% of total
accounts receivable at December 31, 2004 to 54% of total
accounts receivable at December 31, 2005 can be primarily
attributed to the reductions in uninsured accounts receivable
amounts related to the uninsured discount program that was
implemented January 1, 2005.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary —
    Other-than-temporary Impairment Considerations

Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary holds debt and equity
security investments having an aggregate fair value of
$2.384 billion at December 31, 2005. The fair value of
the investment securities is generally based on quoted market
prices. The investment securities are held for the purpose of
providing the funding source to pay professional liability
claims covered by the insurance subsidiary. Management’s
assessment each quarter of whether a decline in fair value is
temporary or other-than-temporary involves multiple subjective
judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of future
events, and requires a significant level of professional
judgment in determining whether factors exist that indicate an
impairment has occurred. Management evaluates, among other
things, the financial position and near term prospects of the
issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of
the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected
future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of
the issuer by a rating agency to determine if, and when, a
decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost
is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and
extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
amortized cost and the ability and intent to retain the
investment to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
investment’s fair value are important components of
management’s investment securities evaluation process.
There were no other-than-temporary declines in fair value during
2003, 2004, or 2005 and at December 31, 2005, the insurance
subsidiary’s investment security portfolio had unrealized
gains of $193 million and unrealized losses of
$9 million.

Professional Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in
an environment with professional liability risks. A substantial
portion of our professional liability risks is insured through a
wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Reserves for professional
liability risks were $1.621 billion and $1.593 billion
at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004,
respectively. The current portion of these reserves,
$285 million and $310 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively, is included in “other accrued
expenses.” Obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are
included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as
the insurance subsidiary remains liable to the extent that
reinsurers do not meet their obligations. Reserves for
professional liability risks (net of $43 million and
$79 million receivable under reinsurance contracts at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) were
$1.578 billion and $1.514 billion at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Reserves and provisions for
professional liability risks are based upon actuarially
determined estimates. The independent actuaries’ estimated
reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance
contracts, were $1.373 billion to $1.589 billion at
December 31, 2005 and $1.296 billion to
$1.530 billion at December 31, 2004. Reserves for
professional liability risks represent the estimated ultimate
cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the
respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves are
estimated using individual case-basis valuations and actuarial
analyses. Those estimates are subject to the effects of trends
in loss severity and frequency. The estimates are continually
reviewed and adjustments are recorded as experience develops or
new information becomes known.

Professional Liability
Claims (Continued)

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
approximately 3,300 and 3,500 individual claims at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and estimates for
potential unreported claims. The time period required to resolve
these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated. The estimation of the
timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Changes
to the estimated reserve amounts are included in current
operating results. Due to the considerable variability that is
inherent in such estimates, there can be no assurance that the
ultimate liability will not exceed management’s estimates.

Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks
were $298 million, $291 million and $380 million
for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company recognized reductions in its estimated
professional liability insurance reserves of $83 million
pretax, or $0.12 per diluted share, during 2005. Results of
operations for 2004 included a reduction in estimated
professional liability reserves of $59 million pretax, or
$0.07 per diluted share. The malpractice reserve reductions
in 2005 and 2004 reflect the recognition by our external
actuaries of improving frequency and severity claim trends at
HCA. This improving frequency and moderating severity can be
primarily attributed to tort reforms enacted in key states,
particularly Texas, and our risk management and patient safety
initiatives, particularly in the areas of obstetrics and
emergency services.

Income Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and
liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary
differences that arise from the recognition of items in
different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax
assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed
in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed
future periods.

Although we believe that we have properly reported taxable
income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws,
federal and state taxing authorities may challenge our tax
positions upon audit. To reflect the possibility that our
positions may not ultimately be sustained, we have established,
and when appropriate adjust, provisions for potential adverse
tax outcomes, based on our evaluation of the underlying facts
and circumstances. Final audit results may vary from our
estimates.

Results of Operations

Revenue/ Volume Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services.
Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are
actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with
third-party payers, including government programs and managed
care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based
upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per
diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges.

Revenues increased 4.1% to $24.455 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2005 from $23.502 billion for the
year ended December 31, 2004 and increased 7.8% for the
year ended December 31, 2004 from $21.808 billion for
the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase in revenues
in 2005 can be attributed to a 0.9% increase in equivalent
admissions and a 3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent
admission compared to the prior year. Our uninsured discount
policy, which became effective January 1, 2005, resulted in
$769 million in discounts to the uninsured being recorded
during 2005. Adjusting for the effect of the

uninsured discounts, revenue per equivalent admission
increased 6.3% in the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to the year ended December 31, 2004. See
“Supplemental Non-GAAP Disclosures, Operating Measures
Adjusted for the Impact of Discounts for the Uninsured.”
The increase in revenues in 2004 can be primarily attributed to
a 1.3% increase in same facility equivalent admissions and
a 6.0% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent
admission compared to the prior year. For the year ended
December 31, 2004, 89.8% of the $1.694 billion
increase in revenues, compared to the year ended
December 31, 2003, was related to the increase in same
facility revenues and the remaining 10.2% of the increase
related to acquired facilities.

Same facility admissions increased 0.1% in 2005 compared to 2004
and increased 0.7% in 2004 compared to 2003. Same facility
inpatient surgeries increased 0.9% and same facility
outpatient surgeries increased 0.3% during 2005 compared to
2004. Same facility inpatient surgeries increased 2.2% and
same facility outpatient surgeries increased 1.4% during
2004 compared to 2003. Same facility emergency room visits
increased 4.8% during 2005 compared to 2004 and
increased 0.2% during 2004 compared to 2003.

Admissions related to Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid,

Prior to 2004, managed Medicaid admissions were classified as
    either Medicaid or managed care.

Same facility uninsured emergency room visits
increased 11.0% and same facility uninsured admissions
increased 9.5% during 2005 compared to 2004. Same facility
uninsured emergency room visits increased 7.6% and same
facility uninsured admissions increased 9.7% during 2004
compared to 2003. Management cannot predict whether the current
trends in same facility emergency room visits and same facility
uninsured admissions will continue.

Several factors negatively affected patient volumes in 2005.
Unit closures and changes in Medicare admission guidelines led
to reductions in rehabilitation and skilled nursing admissions.
Cardiac admissions have been affected by competition from
physician-owned heart hospitals and credentialing decisions made
at some of our Florida hospitals. More stringent enforcement of
case management guidelines led to certain patient services being
classified as outpatient observation visits instead of one-day
admissions. We plan to increase physician recruitment, increase
available medical office building space on or near our campuses,
and continue capital spending devoted to both maintenance of
technology and facilities and growth and expansion programs.
Effective January 1, 2006, we reorganized our operations
management to create a third operating group and created
smaller, more focused divisions and markets, along with
market-based service line strategies.

and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005, we owned and
operated 34 hospitals and 23 surgery centers in the state of
Texas. Our Texas facilities’ revenues totaled
$5.900 billion and $5.771 billion for the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Revenues related to Medicare operating outlier cases for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively,
were $148 million, $124 million and $221 million.
These amounts represent 2.2%, 1.9% and 3.7% of Medicare revenues
and 0.6%, 0.5% and 1.0% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. There can
be no assurances that we will continue to receive these levels
of Medicare outlier payments in future periods.

We provided $1.138 billion, $926 million and
$821 million of charity care during the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. On
January 1, 2005, we modified our policies to provide a
discount to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid
or charity care. These discounts are similar to those provided
to many local managed care plans and totaled $769 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government
health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are
highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial
changes. Legislative changes have resulted in limitations and
even reductions in levels of payments to health care providers
for certain services under these government programs.

Revenues increased 4.1% to $24.455 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2005 compared to $23.502 billion
for the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase in
revenues was due to a 0.9% increase in equivalent admissions and
3.1% increase in revenue per equivalent admission. Adjusting for
the effect of the uninsured discount policy, revenues increased
7.3% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to 2004.
For the year ended December 31, 2005, admissions decreased
0.7% and same facility admissions increased by 0.1% compared to
2004. Outpatient surgical volumes increased 0.2% and increased
0.3% on a same facility basis in 2005 compared to 2004.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.6%
in 2005 and 40.1% in 2004. Adjusting for the effect of the
uninsured discount policy, salaries and benefits were 39.4% of
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Labor rate
increases averaged approximately 4.2% for the year ended
December 31, 2005.

Supply costs increased, as a percentage of revenues, to 16.9%
for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 16.6% for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Adjusting for the effect of
the uninsured discount policy, supplies were 16.4% of revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2005. During 2005, general
supply cost trends included a more stable pricing environment
for medical devices and pharmacy items and a stabilization in
usage rates for drug-eluting stents.

Other operating expenses (primarily consisting of contract
services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and
leases, utilities, insurance and nonincome taxes), as a
percentage of revenues, increased to 16.5% in 2005 from 16.0% in
2004. Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured discount policy,
other operating expenses were 15.9% of revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

The provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of
revenues, declined to 9.6% for the year ended December 31,
2005 from 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2004.
Adjusting for the effect of the uninsured discount policy, the
provision for doubtful accounts was 12.4% of revenues in the
year ended December 31, 2005. The provision for doubtful
accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate
primarily to uninsured amounts due directly from patients. The

ended December 31, 2004 were $56 million. At
December 31, 2005, we had net unrealized gains of
$184 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
securities.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased to $221 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to
$194 million for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in profits at the
Denver, Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization increased, as a percentage of
revenues, to 5.6% in the year ended December 31, 2005 from
5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2004. A portion of the
increase is the result of additional depreciation expense of
approximately $44 million being recorded during 2005 to
correct accumulated depreciation at certain facilities and
assure a consistent application of our accounting policy
relative to certain short-lived medical equipment.

Interest expense increased to $655 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005 from $563 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The average debt balance was
$9.828 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005
compared to $8.853 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2004. The average interest rate for our
long-term debt increased from 6.5% at December 31, 2004 to
7.0% at December 31, 2005.

During 2004, we closed San Jose Medical Center in
San Jose, California, resulting in a pretax asset
impairment charge of $12 million ($8 million
after-tax).

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
increased to $178 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005 compared to $168 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004.

The effective tax rate was 33.8% in the year ended
December 31, 2005 and 36.8% in the year ended
December 31, 2004. During 2005, the effective tax rate was
reduced due to a favorable tax settlement of $48 million
related to the divestures of certain noncore business units in
1998 and 2001 and a tax benefit of $24 million related to
the repatriation of foreign earnings. Excluding the effect of
the combined $72 million of tax benefits, the effective tax
rate for the year ended December 31, 2005 would have been
37.1%.

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and 2003

Net income decreased 6.5% from $1.332 billion, or
$2.61 per diluted share, for the year ended
December 31, 2003 to $1.246 billion, or $2.58 per
diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2004. The
2004 results include a favorable change in the estimated
provision for doubtful accounts totaling $46 million, or
$0.06 per diluted share, based upon refinements to the
allowance for doubtful accounts estimation process related to
estimated recoveries associated with Medicare copayments and
deductibles and collection agency placements, a $59 million
reduction, or $0.07 per diluted share, to the estimated
professional liability reserves, an adverse financial impact
from hurricanes of $40 million, or $0.05 per diluted
share, an impairment of long-lived assets of $12 million,
or $0.02 per diluted share, and a favorable
$19 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, reduction in
the effective income tax rate. The 2003 results include a
favorable settlement with the federal government, net of
investigation related costs, of $33 million, or
$0.04 per diluted share, an asset impairment charge of
$130 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and gains on
sales of facilities of $85 million, or $0.10 per
diluted share.

In April 2003, we completed the acquisition of eleven hospitals
in Kansas City. During the years ended December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively, the acquired Kansas City hospitals
produced revenues of $885 million and $698 million and
losses before income taxes of $31 million and
$35 million. The 2003 amounts include operations subsequent
to the April 1, 2003 acquisition date.

percentage of revenues, decreased to 16.0% in 2004 from 16.8% in
2003. The decrease, as a percentage of revenues, is primarily
due to reductions in the estimated provision for losses related
to professional liability risks from $380 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 to $291 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. Other operating expenses were
adversely affected during 2004 due to repairs and other
miscellaneous expenses which resulted from the hurricanes and
are estimated to have cost $18 million, net of insurance
recoveries. Other operating expenses also tend to decrease, as a
percentage of revenues, when revenue increases, because the
majority of these expenses include significant fixed cost
components.

The provision for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of
revenues, increased to 11.4% for the year ended
December 31, 2004 from 10.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2003. The factors influencing this increase
include increasing patient financial responsibilities and
uninsured accounts, and a deterioration in the collectibility of
these accounts. Management believes the increases in uninsured
patients and deterioration in the collectibility of these
accounts is caused by decreased medical benefits under certain
plans, an increasing amount of patient financial responsibility
under certain plans, high unemployment levels in certain of our
markets, growing numbers of employed individuals choosing not to
buy health insurance and reductions in Medicaid benefits in
certain states.

Gains on investments for the year ended December 31, 2004
of $56 million consist primarily of net gains on investment
securities held by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Gains
on investments for the year ended December 31, 2003 were
$1 million. At December 31, 2004, we had net
unrealized gains of $231 million on the insurance
subsidiary’s investment securities.

Equity in earnings of affiliates remained relatively flat and
were $194 million for the year ended December 31, 2004
compared to $199 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003.

Depreciation and amortization increased, as a percentage of
revenues, to 5.3% in the year ended December 31, 2004
from 5.1% in the year ended December 31, 2003. The
increase of $138 million of depreciation and amortization
is the result of $6.1 billion of capital spending,
including acquisitions, during the last three years.

Interest expense increased from $491 million for the year
ended December 31, 2003 to $563 million for the year
ended December 31, 2004. Our average debt balance increased
from $8.079 billion for the year ended

Years Ended December 31, 2004 and
    2003 (Continued)

December 31, 2003 to $8.853 billion for the year
ended December 31, 2004. The average interest rate for our
long-term debt increased from 6.4% at December 31, 2003 to
6.5% at December 31, 2004.

During 2004, we closed San Jose Medical Center in
San Jose, California, resulting in a pretax charge of
$12 million ($8 million after-tax). During 2003, we
announced plans to discontinue activities associated with the
internal development of a patient accounts receivable management
system, resulting in a pretax charge of $130 million
($79 million after-tax).

During 2003, we recognized a pretax gain of $85 million
($49 million after-tax) on the sales of two leased
hospitals and two consolidating hospitals, and a working capital
settlement related to a sale completed in 2002.

Minority interests in earnings of consolidated entities
increased to $168 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004 compared to $150 million for the
year ended December 31, 2003 due to improved operations
during 2004 at our joint ventures.

The effective income tax rate was 36.8% in 2004 and 38.2% in
2003. Our effective tax rate was adjusted to reduce estimated
state taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004, resulting in a tax
expense reduction of $19 million, or $0.04 per diluted
share.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$3.159 billion in 2005 compared to $2.954 billion in
2004 and $2.292 billion in 2003. Working capital totaled
$1.320 billion at December 31, 2005 and
$1.509 billion at December 31, 2004. Cash flows
provided by operating activities include income tax benefits
related to the exercise of employee stock options which
increased from $31 million and $50 million for the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively, to
$163 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The
lower cash flow from operations in 2003 when compared to both
2005 and 2004 relates, primarily, to government settlement
payments of $942 million made in 2003.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.681 billion,
$1.688 billion and $2.862 billion in 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
were $1.592 billion in 2005, $1.513 billion in 2004
and $1.838 billion in 2003. We expended $126 million,
$44 million and $908 million for acquisitions of
hospitals and health care entities during 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. During April 2003, we completed the acquisition of
the Health Midwest system in Kansas City. The aggregate cash
paid at closing was $855 million. During 2005 and 2004, the
cash used for acquisitions was generally for outpatient and
ancillary services entities. Capital expenditures in all three
years were funded by a combination of cash flows from operations
and the issuance of debt. Annual planned capital expenditures
are expected to approximate $1.9 billion in 2006. At
December 31, 2005, there were projects under construction,
which had an estimated additional cost to complete and equip
over the next five years of $2.6 billion. We expect to
finance capital expenditures with internally generated and
borrowed funds. The sale of five hospitals was completed during
the fourth quarter of 2005 and we received cash proceeds of
approximately $260 million. We have entered into a
definitive agreement with LifePoint Hospitals, Inc.
(“LifePoint”) for the sale of five hospitals for
estimated proceeds of approximately $330 million. Pursuant
to the terms of the agreement, the sale is to close on or prior
to March 31, 2006. On March 10 and March 14, we
received notification in writing from LifePoint asserting that
certain conditions required for the closing of the sale
transaction, including the issuance of final CONs authorizing
the acquisition of the hospitals by LifePoint, cannot be
satisfied by March 31, 2006. LifePoint has stated that it
will not consummate the transaction unless all conditions have
been satisfied. We disagree with

Liquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)

LifePoint’s assertions and are continuing to proceed toward
closing. We intend to consider all available remedies in the
event that LifePoint does not perform its obligations under the
definitive agreement.

Cash flows used in financing activities totaled
$1.400 billion in 2005 and $1.347 billion in 2004,
compared to cash provided by financing activities of
$650 million in 2003. During 2004 and 2003, we increased
amounts outstanding under the Company’s $1.75 billion
revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). We
also accessed the public debt market to raise capital during
2003 and 2004. We received cash inflows of $943 million
related to the exercise of employee stock options during 2005.
During 2005, we repurchased 36.7 million shares of our
common stock for a total cost of $1.856 billion. During
2004, we repurchased 77.4 million shares of our common
stock for a total cost of $3.109 billion. During the second
quarter of 2004, we increased our quarterly dividend payment
from $0.02 per share to $0.13 per share. In January
2005, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our
quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.15 per
share. The Board declared the initial $0.15 per share
dividend payable in the second quarter of 2005. In January 2006,
our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly
dividend from $0.15 per share to $0.17 per share. The
Board declared the initial $0.17 per share dividend payable
on June 1, 2006 to shareholders of record at May 1,
2006.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
capital include amounts available under the Credit Facility
($1.218 billion as of December 31, 2005 and
$1.056 billion as of February 15, 2006) and
anticipated access to public and private debt markets.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiary,
to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
$2.384 billion and $2.322 billion at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance
recoveries, during the next twelve months are expected to
approximate $260 million. Our wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts, and
the obligations covered by the reinsurance contracts are
included in the reserves for professional liability risks, as
the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers
do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts.
To minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies,
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and
monitor concentrations of credit risk arising from similar
activities or economic characteristics of the reinsurers. The
amounts receivable related to the reinsurance contracts were
$43 million and $79 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

Share Repurchase Activities

On October 14, 2005, we commenced a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.500 billion of our common stock. In November 2005, we
closed the tender offer and repurchased 28.7 million shares
of our common stock for an aggregate price of
$1.437 billion ($50.00 per share). The shares
repurchased represented approximately 6% of our outstanding
shares at the time of the tender offer. We also repurchased
8.0 million shares of our common stock for
$412 million through open market purchases during the
fourth quarter of 2005.

In October 2004, we announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.501 billion of our common stock. In November 2004, we
closed the tender offer and repurchased 62 million shares
of our common stock for an aggregate price of
$2.466 billion ($39.75 per share). The shares
repurchased represented approximately 13% of our outstanding
shares at the time of the tender offer. We also repurchased
0.9 million shares of our common stock for $35 million
through open market purchases which completed the
$2.501 billion share repurchase authorization.

In April 2003, we announced an authorization to repurchase
$1.5 billion of our common stock through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2003, we
repurchased under this

authorization 25.3 million shares of its common stock for
$900 million, through open market purchases. During 2004,
we repurchased 14.5 million shares of our common stock for
$600 million, through open market purchases, which
completed this authorization.

In July 2002, we announced an authorization to repurchase up to
12 million shares of our common stock. During 2002, we made
open market purchases of 6.2 million shares for
$282 million. During 2003, we purchased 5.8 million
shares for $214 million, through open market purchases,
which completed the repurchases under this authorization.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the share repurchase transactions
reduced stockholders’ equity by $1.856 billion,
$3.109 billion and $1.114 billion, respectively.

Financing Activities

Our revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”)
is a $1.75 billion agreement expiring November 2009. As of
December 31, 2005, we had $475 million outstanding
under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2005,
interest is payable generally at either a spread to LIBOR, plus
0.4% to 1.0% (depending on our credit ratings), the prime
lending rate or a competitive bid rate. The Credit Facility
contains customary covenants which include (i) limitations
on debt levels, (ii) limitations on sales of assets,
mergers and changes of ownership, and (iii) maintenance of
minimum interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2005,
we were in compliance with all such covenants.

In February 2006, we issued $1.0 billion of 6.5% notes
due February 2016. Proceeds from the notes were used to
refinance amounts outstanding under an $800 million term
loan entered into in November 2005 and to pay down amounts
advanced under the Credit Facility.

In November 2005, in connection with our modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer, we entered into a
$1.0 billion credit agreement with several banks, was
scheduled to mature in May 2006. Under this agreement, we
borrowed $800 million ( the “2005 Term
Loan”). Proceeds from the 2005 Term Loan were used to
partially fund the repurchase of our common stock. The 2005 Term
Loan contained a mandatory prepayment clause which required us
to prepay amounts outstanding after receiving proceeds from the
issuance of debt or equity securities or from asset sales.
Proceeds of $175 million from the sale of hospitals and a
portion of the proceeds from the $1.0 billion
6.5% notes issued in February 2006 were used to repay the
amounts outstanding under the 2005 Term Loan.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, in response to our 2004
tender offer to repurchase our common stock, Standard &
Poor’s downgraded our senior debt rating from BBB- to BB+
and Fitch Ratings downgraded our senior debt rating from BBB- to
BB+. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded our senior debt
rating from Bal to Ba2.

During November 2004, we entered into a $2.5 billion credit
agreement (the “2004 Credit Agreement”) with several
banks. The 2004 Credit Agreement consists of a $750 million
amortizing term loan which matures in 2009 (the “2004 Term
Loan”) and the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the 2004 Term
Loan were used to refinance a prior bank loan and for general
corporate purposes.

During November 2004, we issued $500 million of
5.5% notes due December 1, 2009 and issued
$750 million of 6.375% notes due January 15,
2015. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the term loan entered into in connection with
our 2004 tender offer.

During March 2004, we issued $500 million of
5.75% notes due March 15, 2014. The proceeds from the
issuance were used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding
under our prior revolving credit facility and for general
corporate purposes.

During November 2003, we issued $350 million of
5.25% notes due November 6, 2008 and issued
$250 million of 7.5% notes due November 6, 2033.
Proceeds from the notes were used to repay a portion of the
amounts outstanding under a prior revolving credit facility.

In February 2003, we issued $500 million of
6.25% notes due February 15, 2013. In July 2003, we
issued $500 million of 6.75% notes due July 15,
2003. The proceeds from both issuances were used to repay a
portion of the amounts outstanding under a prior revolving
credit facility and for general corporate purposes.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts
available under the Credit Facility and our anticipated access
to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet
expected liquidity needs during the next twelve months.

Market Risk

HCA is exposed to market risk related to changes in market
values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
$1.419 billion and $965 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2005. These investments are carried at fair
value with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded
as adjustments to other comprehensive income. The fair value of
investments is generally based on quoted market prices. If the
insurance subsidiary were to experience significant declines in
the fair value of its investments, this could require additional
investment by the Company to allow the insurance subsidiary to
satisfy its minimum capital requirements.

Management evaluates, among other things, the financial position
and near term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the
issuer’s industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in
the amount or timing of expected future cash flows from the
investment, and recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating
agency to determine if and when a decline in the fair value of
an investment below amortized cost is considered
“other-than-temporary.” The length of time and extent
to which the fair value of the investment is less than amortized
cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment to
allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s fair
value are important components of management’s investment
securities evaluation process. At December 31, 2005, we had
a net unrealized gain of $184 million on the insurance
subsidiary’s investment securities.

HCA is also exposed to market risk related to changes in
interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations.
Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed
and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based
on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts and interest payments in these agreements match
the cash flows of the related liabilities. The notional amounts
of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the
exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.
Any market risk or opportunity associated with these swap
agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the
related debt. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
financial institutions. The interest payments under these
agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives and the
related hedged debt amounts have been recognized in the
financial statements at their respective fair values.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately
$3.125 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2005
is subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining
balance in long-term debt of $7.350 billion at
December 31, 2005 is subject to fixed rates of interest.
Both the general level of U.S. interest rates and, for the
2004 Credit Agreement, our credit rating affects our variable
interest rates. Our variable rate debt is comprised of amounts
outstanding under the 2004 Credit Agreement and fixed rate notes
on which interest rate swaps have been employed. The 2004 Credit
Agreement consists of the Credit Facility, on which interest is
payable generally at LIBOR plus 0.4% to 1.0% and the 2004 Term
Loan, on which interest is



HCA INC.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Market Risk (Continued)

payable generally at LIBOR plus 0.5% to 1.25%. The fixed rate
notes on which interest rate swaps have been employed have
interest that is payable at LIBOR plus 1.39% to 2.39%. Due to
increases in LIBOR, the average rate for our long-term debt
increased from 6.5% at December 31, 2004 to 7.0% at
December 31, 2005. The estimated fair value of our total
long-term debt was $10.733 billion at December 31,
2005. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues of long-term debt
with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in
interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future
pretax earnings would be approximately $31 million. The
impact of such a change in interest rates on the fair value of
long-term debt would not be significant. The estimated changes
to interest expense and the fair value of long-term debt are
determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates
on our borrowing cost and long-term debt balances. To mitigate
the impact of fluctuations in interest rates, we generally
target a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed
rates.

Foreign operations and the related market risks associated with
foreign currency are currently insignificant to our results of
operations and financial position.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare
patients are established under the federal government’s
prospective payment system. Total Medicare revenues approximated
27% in 2005 and 28% in both 2004 and 2003 of our total patient
revenues.

Management believes that hospital industry operating margins
have been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure
because of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses
in excess of the increase in prospective payments under the
Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain
operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare
patients is limited.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the United
States Tax Court (the “Tax Court”), and the United
States Court of Federal Claims, certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2002 federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1991 through 1993 federal income tax returns and Healthtrust,
Inc. — The Hospital Company’s
(“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994 federal income tax
returns.

During 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed a Tax Court decision received in 1996 related
to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of America’s
1987 through 1988 Federal income tax returns, in which the IRS
contested the method that Hospital Corporation of America used
to calculate its tax allowance for doubtful accounts. HCA filed
a petition for review by the United States Supreme Court, which
was denied in October 2004. Due to the volume and complexity of
calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, the IRS has
not determined the amount of additional tax and interest that it
may claim for taxable years after 1988. In December 2004, HCA
made a deposit of $109 million for additional tax and
interest, based on its estimate of amounts due for taxable
periods through 1998.

Other disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of
the 2001 government settlement payment, the timing of
recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000 through
2002, the method for calculating the tax allowance for
uncollectible accounts in 2002, and the amount of insurance
expense deducted in 1999



HCA INC.

through 2002. The IRS has claimed an additional
$776 million in income taxes, interest and penalties
through December 31, 2005 with respect to these issues.

During February 2006, the IRS began an examination of HCA’s
2003 through 2004 federal income tax returns. The IRS has not
determined the amount of any additional income tax, interest and
penalties that it may claim upon completion of this examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded
to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. Management
believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation of America and
Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
the IRS during previous examinations and that final resolution
of these disputes will not have a material adverse effect on the
results of operations or financial position.

Controls and Procedures

1. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined
under
Rule

13a-15(e)

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this
evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this annual report.

2. Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
term is defined in Exchange Act
Rule

13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2005.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.
Ernst & Young’s attestation report is included
herein.



(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting, that HCA Inc. maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
HCA Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that HCA Inc.
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, HCA
Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of HCA Inc. as of December 31,
2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2005, and our
report dated March 8, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
HCA Inc. as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of HCA Inc. at December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the consolidated results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of HCA Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 8, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Reporting Entity

HCA Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and operate
hospitals and related health care entities. The term
“affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
of HCA Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such
subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2005, these
affiliates owned and operated 175 hospitals, 87 freestanding
surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary
services. Affiliates of HCA are also partners in joint ventures
that own and operate seven hospitals and seven freestanding
surgery centers, which are accounted for using the equity
method. The Company’s facilities are located in
22 states, England and Switzerland. The terms
“HCA” or the “Company”, as used in this
annual report on
Form

10-K,

refer
to HCA Inc. and its affiliates unless otherwise stated or
indicated by context.

Basis of Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
and entities controlled by HCA. “Control” is generally
defined by HCA as ownership of a majority of the voting interest
of an entity. The consolidated financial statements include
entities in which HCA absorbs a majority of the entity’s
expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership,
contractual or other financial interests in the entity.
Significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Investments in entities that HCA does not control, but in which
it has a substantial ownership interest and can exercise
significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

HCA has completed various acquisitions and joint venture
transactions. The accounts of these entities have been
consolidated with those of HCA for periods subsequent to the
acquisition of controlling interests. The majority of the
Company’s expenses are “cost of revenue” items.
Costs that could be classified as general and administrative
would include the corporate office costs, which were
$185 million, $162 million and $156 million for
the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
are recorded based upon established billing rates less
allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
during the period the health care services are provided, based
upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies
(under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health
plans, commercial insurance companies and employers. Estimates
of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are
based upon the payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed
care agreements are generally based upon predetermined rates per
diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted fee-for-service rates.

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded
estimates will change by a material amount. The estimated
reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost
reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are
determined (in relation to certain government programs,
primarily Medicare, this is generally referred to as the
“cost report” filing and settlement process). The
adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
in net increases to revenues, related to cost reports filed
during the respective year were $49 million,
$44 million and $70 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The adjustments to estimated reimbursement
amounts, which resulted in net increases to

F-7


HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Revenues (Continued)

revenues, related to cost reports filed during previous years
were $36 million, $26 million and $26 million in
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
(“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
require, and HCA’s commitment to providing quality patient
care encourages, the Company to provide services to patients who
are financially unable to pay for the health care services they
receive. Because HCA does not pursue collection of amounts
determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
revenues. Patients treated at an HCA hospital for nonelective
care, who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty
level, are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level
is established by the federal government and is based on income
and family size. On January 1, 2005, HCA modified its
policies to provide a discount to uninsured patients who do not
qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
implementing the discount policy, HCA first attempts to qualify
uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Carrying
values of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due
to the short-term nature of these instruments.

The Company’s cash management system provides for daily
investment of available balances and the funding of outstanding
checks when presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented,
checks totaling $493 million and $375 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been
included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets.
Upon presentation for payment, these checks are funded through
available cash balances or the Company’s existing credit
facility.

Accounts Receivable

HCA receives payments for services rendered from federal and
state agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs),
managed care health plans, commercial insurance companies,
employers and patients. During the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately 27%, 28% and 28%,
respectively, of HCA’s revenues related to patients
participating in the Medicare program. HCA recognizes that
revenues and receivables from government agencies are
significant to its operations, but does not believe that there
are significant credit risks associated with these government
agencies. HCA does not believe that there are any other
significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer
that would subject it to any significant credit risks in the
collection of its accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
off as uncollectable are deducted from the allowance for
doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The
amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
management’s assessment of historical and expected net
collections, business and economic conditions, trends

HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Accounts
Receivable (Continued)

in federal, state, and private employer health care coverage and
other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts
and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to
“uninsured” amounts (including copayment and
deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage)
due directly from patients. Accounts are written off when all
reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
performed. HCA considers the return of an account from the
primary external collection agency to be the culmination of its
reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for writing
off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon specific
identification and the writeoff process requires a writeoff
adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. Management
relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical
writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent a majority
of HCA’s revenues and accounts receivable (the
“hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of
information to utilize in estimating the collectability of
HCA’s accounts receivable. The Company performs the
hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling

twelve-months

accounts
receivable collection and writeoff data. At December 31,
2005, HCA’s allowance for doubtful accounts represented
approximately 85% of the $3.404 billion patient due
accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of
estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which
eligibility for Medicaid coverage was being evaluated
(“pending Medicaid accounts”). Revenue days in
accounts receivable were 50 days, 48 days and
52 days at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Adverse changes in general economic conditions,
patient accounting service center operations, payer mix, or
trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage
could affect HCA’s collection of accounts receivable, cash
flows and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out)
or market.

Property and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
was $1.371 billion in 2005, $1.248 billion in 2004,
and $1.108 billion in 2003. Buildings and improvements are
depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
generally from four to 10 years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the lives of the
respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
deferred loan costs at both December 31, 2005 and 2004 was
$138 million and accumulated amortization was
$53 million and $39 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Amortization of deferred loan costs is
included in interest expense and was $14 million,
$14 million and $10 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate that
the carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) that are
expected to be held and used, might be impaired, HCA prepares
projections of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to
result from the use of the assets and their eventual
disposition. If the projections indicate that the recorded
amounts are not expected to be recoverable, such amounts are
reduced to estimated fair value. Fair value may be estimated
based upon internal evaluations that include quantitative
analyses of revenues and cash flows, reviews of recent sales of
similar facilities and independent appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
tests. In addition to the annual impairment reviews, impairment
reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible
impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at
the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below
the business segment level, and HCA’s impairment testing is
performed at the operating division or market level. The Company
compares the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the
carrying amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if
there is potential impairment. If the fair value of the
reporting unit assets is less than their carrying value, the
Company compares the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying
value. If the fair value of the goodwill is less than its
carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. Fair value of
goodwill is estimated based upon internal evaluations of the
related long-lived assets for each reporting unit that include
quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows and reviews of
recent sales of similar facilities. No goodwill impairment
losses were recognized during 2005, 2004 or 2003.

During 2005, goodwill increased by $129 million related to
acquisitions, decreased by $35 million related to facility
sales and decreased by $8 million related to foreign
currency translation adjustments. During 2004, goodwill
increased by $53 million related to acquisitions and
increased by $6 million related to foreign currency
translation adjustments.

Professional Liability Claims

A substantial portion of HCA’s professional liability risks
is insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary of HCA,
which is funded annually. Reserves for professional liability
risks were $1.621 billion and $1.593 billion at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The current
portion of the reserves, $285 million and $310 million
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, is included in
“other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance
sheet. Provisions for losses related to professional liability
risks were $298 million, $291 million and
$380 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in “other
operating expenses” in the Company’s consolidated
income statement. Provisions for losses related to professional
liability risks are based upon actuarially determined estimates.
Loss and loss expense reserves represent the estimated ultimate
net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through
the respective consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves
for unpaid losses and loss expenses are estimated using
individual case-basis valuations and actuarial analyses. Those
estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity
and frequency. The estimates are continually reviewed and
adjustments are recorded as experience develops or new
information becomes known. The adjustments to the estimated
reserve amounts are included in current operating results. The
provision for losses for 2005 and 2004 include reductions of
$83 million ($0.12 per diluted share) and
$59 million ($0.07 per diluted share), respectively,
to the Company’s estimated professional liability insurance
reserves. The amount of the changes to the estimated
professional liability insurance reserves was determined based
upon the semiannual, independent actuarial analyses, which
recognized declining frequency and moderating severity claims
trends at HCA. HCA believes these favorable trends are primarily
attributable to tort reforms enacted in key states, particularly
Texas, and HCA’s risk management and patient safety
initiatives, particularly in the areas of obstetrics and
emergency services. The reserves for professional liability
risks cover approximately 3,300 and 3,500 individual claims at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and estimates for
potential unreported claims. The time period required to resolve
these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
whether the claim is settled or litigated. During 2005 and 2004,
$242 million and $268 million, respectively, of
payments (net of reinsurance recoveries of $12 million and
$21 million, respectively) were made for professional and
general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of
payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Although
considerable variability is inherent in professional liability
reserve estimates, management believes that the reserves for

F-10


HCA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Professional Liability
Claims (Continued)

losses and loss expenses are adequate; however, there can be no
assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed
management’s estimates.

HCA’s facilities are insured by the wholly-owned insurance
subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The
insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional
liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million
per occurrence. HCA also maintains professional liability
insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in
excess of amounts insured by its insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are included in
the reserves for professional liability risks, as the subsidiary
remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet
their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. The amounts
receivable under the reinsurance contracts of $43 million
and $79 million at December 31, 2005, and 2004,
respectively, are included in other assets (including
$25 million at both December 31, 2005 and 2004
included in other current assets). Returns of premiums relating
to reinsurance contracts resulted in net increases to the
reserves for professional liability risks of $8 million and
$14 million during 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Investments of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the investments of
HCA’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as
“available-for-sale” as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, “Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” and
are recorded at fair value. The investment securities are held
for the purpose of providing the funding source to pay
professional liability claims covered by the insurance
subsidiary. Management performs a quarterly assessment of
individual investment securities to determine whether declines
in market value are temporary or other-than-temporary.
Management’s investment securities evaluation process
involves multiple subjective judgments, often involves
estimating the outcome of future events, and requires a
significant level of professional judgment in determining
whether an impairment has occurred. HCA evaluates, among other
things, the financial position and near term prospects of the
issuer, conditions in the issuer’s industry, liquidity of
the investment, changes in the amount or timing of expected
future cash flows from the investment, and recent downgrades of
the issuer by a rating agency, to determine if, and when, a
decline in the fair value of an investment below amortized cost
is considered other-than-temporary. The length of time and
extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than
amortized cost and HCA’s ability and intent to retain the
investment, to allow for any anticipated recovery of the
investment’s fair value, are important components of
management’s investment securities evaluation process.

Minority Interests in Consolidated Entities

The consolidated financial statements include all assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned
entities that are controlled by HCA. Accordingly, management has
recorded minority interests in the earnings and equity of such
entities.

Related Party Transactions

MedCap Properties, LLC (“MedCap”)

In December 2000, HCA transferred 116 medical office buildings
(“MOBs”) to MedCap. HCA received approximately
$250 million and a minority interest (approximately 48%) in
MedCap in the transaction. MedCap, a private company, was formed
by HCA and other investors to acquire the buildings. HCA did not

recognize a gain or loss on the transaction. A relative of a
director and former executive officer of the Company served as
the chief manager of MedCap.

In October 2003, MedCap was sold to Health Care Property
Investors, Inc. (“HCP”). The sale of MedCap to HCP
included HCA’s ownership interest in MedCap, and HCA has no
ownership interest in HCP. The distribution of the MedCap sale
proceeds resulted in HCA recording a deferred gain of
$80 million. The transaction was originally accounted for
as a financing transaction and the gain amount was deferred due
to HCA’s continuing involvement with the MOBs related to
certain contingent, protective put and call rights. During the
second quarter of 2005, the contingent, protective put and call
rights were eliminated and HCA recognized $29 million of
the deferred gain and the remaining portion of the deferred gain
is being amortized over the applicable lease terms for the MOBs
in which HCA leases space from HCP. The former chief manager of
MedCap, continues to manage the MOBs as an employee of HCP.

HCA leased certain office space from MedCap and, during the year
ended December 31, 2003 (through September 2003), paid
MedCap $16.1 million in rents for such leased office space.
HCA continues to lease certain office space from HCP. HCA
believes its transactions with MedCap were on terms no less
favorable to HCA than those which would have been obtained from
an unaffiliated party.

HealthStream, Inc. (“HealthStream”

)

In October 2001, HCA entered into an amended four-year agreement
with HealthStream to purchase internet-based education and
training services. The agreement expired during 2005. During
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid HealthStream
$3.2 million, $3.2 million, and $2.6 million,
respectively, which represented approximately 12%, 16% and 15%,
respectively, of HealthStream’s net revenues. The chief

directors of HealthStream is a relative of a director and former
executive officer of HCA. HCA believes its transactions with
HealthStream are on terms no less favorable to HCA than those
which would be obtained from an unaffiliated party.

Share-Based Compensation

HCA applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
benefit plans. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been
recognized for HCA stock options granted under the plans because
the exercise prices for options granted were equal to the quoted
market prices on the option grant dates and all option grants
were to employees or directors.

As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), HCA has
determined pro forma net income and earnings per share, as if
compensation cost for HCA’s employee stock option and stock
purchase plans had been determined based

upon fair values at the grant dates. These pro forma amounts are
as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

(a)

In December 2004, HCA accelerated the vesting of all unvested
    stock options awarded to employees and officers which had
    exercise prices greater than the closing price at
    December 14, 2004 of $40.89 per share. Options to
    purchase approximately 19.1 million shares became
    exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration.
    The decision to accelerate vesting of the identified stock
    options will result in the Company not being required to
    recognize share-based compensation expense, net of taxes, of
    approximately $36 million in 2006, $19 million in
    2007, and $2 million in 2008, under the provisions of
    Financial Accounting Standard Board (the “FASB”),
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”).
    The elimination of the requirement to recognize compensation
    expense in future periods related to the unvested stock options
    was management’s basis for the decision to accelerate the
    vesting. The effect of accelerating the vesting for all unvested
    options with exercise prices greater than $40.89 per share
    was an increase to the pro forma share-based employee
    compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2004
    of $112 million after-tax ($0.24 per basic share and
    $0.23 per diluted share).

For SFAS 123 purposes, the weighted average fair values of
HCA’s stock options granted in 2005, 2004 and 2003 were
$15.53, $12.90 and $13.49 per share, respectively. The fair
values were estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation
model with the following weighted average assumptions:




Risk-free interest rate

2.62

%

Expected volatility


%


%


%

Expected life, in years




Expected dividend yield

1.27

%

1.18

The expected volatility is derived using weekly, historical
market price data for periods preceding the date of grant. The
risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on United
States Treasury Strips, having a term equivalent to the expected
life of the stock option, on the date of grant. The expected
life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be
held before it is exercised. The valuation model was not
adjusted for nontransferability, risk of forfeiture or the
vesting restrictions of the options, all of which would reduce
the value if factored into the calculation.

Share-Based Compensation (Continued)

The pro forma pretax compensation cost related to the shares of
common stock issued under HCA’s amended and restated
Employee Stock Purchase Plan was $17 million,
$15 million and $17 million for the years 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively. These pro forma costs were determined
based on the estimated fair values at the beginning of each
subscription period.

Derivatives

HCA has designated its outstanding interest rate swap agreements
as fair value hedges. HCA has determined that the current
agreements are highly effective in offsetting the fair value
changes in a portion of HCA’s debt portfolio. These
derivatives and the related hedged debt amounts have been
recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their
respective fair values.

Recent Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, which requires
all companies to measure compensation cost for all share-based
payments (including employee stock options) at fair value, and
is effective for most public companies for annual periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. HCA expects to adopt
SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2006, using the
“modified prospective” method. Under this method,
compensation costs will be recognized, beginning with the
effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for
all share-based payments granted after the effective date, and
based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards
granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain
unvested on the effective date. The impact on the results of
operations of adoption of SFAS 123R will depend on levels
of share-based payments granted in the future, and the market
value of HCA common stock and other variables that affect the
valuation model for options granted. Based upon expected grant
levels and values at December 31, 2005, the Company
estimates the impact on results of operations, net of income
taxes, will approximate $30 million to $40 million in
2006. SFAS 123R requires the benefits of tax deductions in
excess of amounts recognized as compensation cost be reported as
a financing cash flow, rather than an operating cash flow, as
required under prior accounting guidance. This requirement will
reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash
flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot
estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they
depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock
options), the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for
such excess tax deductions were $163 million,
$50 million and $31 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity” (“SFAS 150”). This statement
generally requires liability classification for two broad
classes of financial instruments. Under SFAS 150,
instruments that represent, or are indexed to, an obligation to
buy back the issuer’s shares, regardless of whether the
instrument is settled on a net-cash or gross physical basis, are
required to be classified as liabilities. Obligations that can
be settled in shares, but either derive their value
predominately from some other underlying, have a fixed value, or
have a value to the counterparty that moves in the opposite
direction as the issuer’s shares, are also required to be
classified as liabilities under this statement. In October 2003,
the FASB voted to defer, for an indefinite period, the
application of the SFAS 150 guidance to noncontrolling
interests in limited-life subsidiaries. The FASB decided to
defer this application of SFAS 150 to allow them the
opportunity to consider possible implementation issues that
would result from the proposed SFAS 150 guidance regarding
measurement and recognition of noncontrolling interests. HCA
will assess the impact of the FASB’s reconsiderations, if
any, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements
when they are finalized.

Pronouncements (Continued)

In November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
No. 45-3, “Application of FASB Interpretation
No. 45 to Minimum Revenue Guarantees Granted to a Business
or Its Owners” (“FSP FIN 45-3”). It served
as an amendment to FASB Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others” (“FIN 45”) by adding minimum revenue
guarantees to the list of examples of contracts to which
FIN 45 applies. Under FSP FIN 45-3, a guarantor is
required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in
issuing the guarantee. One example cited in FSP FIN 45-3
involves a guarantee provided by a health care entity to a
nonemployed physician in order to recruit such physician to move
to the entity’s geographical area and establish a private
practice, which is an approach HCA uses to recruit physicians.

FSP FIN 45-3 is effective for new minimum revenue
guarantees issued or modified on or after January 1, 2006.
For periods before January 1, 2006, HCA expensed the
physician recruitment agreement amounts as incurred to the
recruited physicians, which was generally over a 12 month
period. HCA recorded expenses of approximately $82 million
related to physician recruitment agreements for the year ended
December 31, 2005. HCA is in the process of evaluating the
expected impact of the adoption of FSP FIN 45-3 on results
of operations for 2006.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2005, HCA recognized a net pretax gain of
$49 million ($19 million after-tax) on the sales of
five rural hospitals. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay
bank borrowings. During 2004, HCA opened one hospital, sold one
hospital, and closed two hospitals. During 2003, HCA recognized
a net pretax gain of $85 million ($49 million
after-tax) on the sales of two leased hospitals and two
consolidating hospitals and a working capital settlement related
to a sale completed in 2002. Proceeds from the sales were used
to repay bank borrowings.

During 2005 and 2004, HCA did not acquire any hospitals, but
paid $126 million and $44 million, respectively, for
other health care entities. During 2003, HCA completed the
acquisition of the Health Midwest hospital system in Kansas
City. The purchase price was allocated to the related assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective
fair values. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts and operations of the Health Midwest entities
subsequent to the April 1, 2003 acquisition date. The pro
forma effect of the acquired entities on HCA’s results of
operations for periods prior to the acquisition date was not
significant.

NOTE 3 — IMPAIRMENTS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

The carrying value for a hospital HCA closed during 2004 was
reduced to fair value of $39 million, based upon estimates
of sales value, resulting in a pretax charge of
$12 million. The 2004 impairment charge affected HCA’s
Western Group.

During 2003, HCA announced plans to discontinue activities
associated with the internal development of a patient accounts
receivable management system, resulting in a pretax charge of
$130 million. HCA reduced the carrying value for
capitalized costs associated with the patient accounts
receivable management system components that were discontinued.
The 2003 impairment charge affected HCA’s “Corporate
and other” operating segment.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
on the Company’s operations or cash flows and are not
expected to significantly impact cash flows for future periods.

IRS Disputes

HCA is currently contesting before the Appeals Division of the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the United
States Tax Court (the “Tax Court”), and the United
States Court of Federal Claims, certain claimed deficiencies and
adjustments proposed by the IRS in conjunction with its
examinations of HCA’s 1994-2002 federal income tax returns,
Columbia Healthcare Corporation’s (“CHC”) 1993
and 1994 federal income tax returns, HCA-Hospital Corporation of
America’s (“Hospital Corporation of America”)
1991 through 1993 federal income tax returns and Healthtrust,
Inc. — The Hospital Company’s
(“Healthtrust”) 1990 through 1994 federal income tax
returns.

During 2003, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed a Tax Court decision received in 1996 related
to the IRS examination of Hospital Corporation of America’s
1987 through 1988 federal income tax returns, in which the IRS
contested the method that Hospital Corporation of America used
to calculate its tax allowance for doubtful accounts. HCA filed
a petition for review by the United States Supreme Court, which
was denied in October 2004. Due to the volume and complexity of
calculating the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, the IRS has
not determined the amount of additional tax and interest that it
may claim for taxable years after 1988. In December 2004, HCA
made a deposit of $109 million for additional tax and
interest, based on its estimate of amounts due for taxable
periods through 1998.

Other disputed items include the deductibility of a portion of
the 2001 government settlement payment, the timing of
recognition of certain patient service revenues in 2000 through
2002, the method for calculating the tax allowance for
uncollectable accounts in 2002, and the amount of insurance
expense deducted in 1999 through 2002. The IRS has claimed an
additional $776 million in income taxes, interest, and
penalties through December 31, 2005, with respect to these
issues.

During February 2006, the IRS began an examination of
HCA’s 2003 through 2004 federal income tax returns. The IRS
has not determined the amount of any additional income tax,
interest and penalties that it may claim upon completion of this
examination.

Management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded
to satisfy final resolution of the disputed issues. Management
believes that HCA, CHC, Hospital Corporation of America and
Healthtrust properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
the IRS during previous examinations and that final resolution
of these disputes will not have a material adverse effect on
results of operations or financial position.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

HCA has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage its
exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate
interest payments between two parties based on common notional
principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-floating swaps
effectively convert fixed rate obligations to LIBOR indexed
variable rate instruments. The notional amounts and timing of
interest payments in these agreements match the related
liabilities. The notional amounts of the swap agreements
represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows
and are not assets or liabilities of HCA. Any market risk or
opportunity associated with these swap agreements is offset by
the opposite market impact on the related debt. HCA’s
credit risk related to these agreements is considered low
because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial
institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are
settled on a net basis.

agreements at December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions):

ratings), the prime lending rate or a competitive bid rate. The
Credit Facility contains customary covenants which include
(i) limitations on debt levels, (ii) limitations on
sales of assets, mergers and changes of ownership and
(iii) maintenance of minimum interest coverage ratios. As

Significant Financing Activities


In February 2006, HCA issued $1.0 billion of 6.5% notes due
February 2016. Proceeds of $625 million were used to refinance
amounts outstanding under the term loan entered into in November
2005 and the remaining proceeds were used to pay down amounts
advanced under the Credit Facility.


In November 2005, HCA entered into a $1.0 billion credit
agreement with several banks, which matures in May 2006. Under
this agreement, the Company borrowed $800 million (the
“2005 Term Loan”). Proceeds from the 2005 Term Loan
were used to partially fund the repurchase of the Company’s
common stock. The 2005 Term Loan contains a mandatory prepayment
clause which requires the Company to prepay amounts outstanding
after receiving proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity
securities or from asset sales. The proceeds of
$175 million from the sale of hospitals and a portion of
the proceeds from the $1.0 billion 6.5% notes issued in
February 2006 were used to repay the amounts outstanding under
the 2005 Term Loan. In accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 6, “Classification of
Short-Term Obligations Expected to be Refinanced,” because
the balance of the 2005 Term Loan was refinanced in February
2006, the 2005 Term Loan is classified as “long-term
debt” in the December 31, 2005 consolidated balance
sheet.


In March 2004, HCA issued $500 million of 5.75% notes
due March 15, 2014. The proceeds from the issuance were
used to repay a portion of the amounts outstanding under the
Company’s previous revolving credit facility and for
general corporate purposes.

In November 2004, HCA entered into a $2.5 billion credit
agreement (the “2004 Credit Agreement”) with several
banks. The 2004 Credit Agreement consists of a $750 million
amortizing term loan which matures in 2009 (the “2004 Term
Loan”) and the Credit Facility. Proceeds from the 2004 Term
Loan were used to refinance a prior bank loan and for general
corporate purposes.

During November 2004, HCA issued $500 million of
5.5% notes due December 1, 2009 and issued
$750 million of 6.375% notes due January 15,
2015. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility and for general corporate
purposes.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, in response to the
Company’s tender offer to repurchase the Company’s
common stock, Standard & Poor’s downgraded
HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB- to BB+ and Fitch Ratings
downgraded HCA’s senior debt rating from BBB- to BB+.
Moody’s Investors Service downgraded HCA’s senior debt
rating from Bal to Ba2.

In December 2004, HCA filed a shelf registration statement and
prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will
allow the Company to issue, from time to time, up to
$1.5 billion in debt securities. In February 2006, HCA
issued $1.0 billion of debt securities under this shelf
registration.

General Information

Maturities of long-term debt in years 2007 through 2010
(excluding borrowings under the Credit Facility) are
$454 million, $759 million, $897 million and
$1.090 billion, respectively.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt

NOTE 9 — CONTINGENCIES

Significant Legal Proceedings

HCA operates in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
asserted against the Company. The resolution of any such
lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have
a material, adverse affect on HCA’s results of operations
and financial position in a given period.

In 2005, HCA and certain of its executive officers and directors
were named in various federal securities law class actions and
several shareholders filed derivative lawsuits purportedly on
behalf of the Company. Additionally, a former employee of HCA
filed a complaint against certain of HCA’s executive
officers pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
and the Company has been served with a shareholder demand letter
addressed to our Board of Directors. HCA cannot predict the
results of the investigations or any related lawsuits, or the
effect that findings in such investigations or lawsuits may have
on the Company.

General Liability Claims

HCA is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may
seek punitive damages against HCA which may not be covered by
insurance. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate
resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will
not have a material, adverse effect on HCA’s results of
operations or financial position.

Investigations and Settlement of Certain Government Claims

Commencing in 1997, HCA became aware it was the subject of
governmental investigations and litigation relating to its
business practices. The investigations were concluded through a
series of agreements executed in 2000 and 2003. In January 2001,
HCA entered into an eight-year Corporate Integrity Agreement
(“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the
Department of Health and Human Services.

During June 2003, HCA announced that the Company and the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) had signed
an agreement, documenting the understanding announced in March
2002, to resolve all Medicare cost report, home office cost
statement and appeal issues between HCA and CMS (the “CMS
Agreement”) for cost report periods ended before
August 1, 2001. As a result of the CMS Agreement, HCA paid
CMS $250 million in June 2003.

During June 2003, HCA also announced that the Company and the
Civil Division of the Department of Justice (the
“DOJ”) had signed agreements, documenting the
understanding announced in December 2002, whereby the United
States would dismiss the various claims it had brought related
to physician relations, cost reports and wound care issues (the
“DOJ Agreement”). The DOJ Agreement received court
approval in July 2003, and HCA paid the DOJ $641 million
(including accrued interest of $10 million) during July
2003. HCA also finalized an agreement with a negotiating team
representing states that may have claims against the Company.
Under this agreement, HCA paid $17.7 million in July 2003
to state Medicaid agencies to resolve these claims. HCA also
paid $33 million for legal fees of the private parties who
had brought

The terms and conditions associated with each class of
HCA’s common stock are substantially identical, except for
voting rights. All nonvoting common stockholders may convert
their shares on a one-for-one basis into voting common stock,
subject to certain limitations.

Stock Repurchase Programs

In October 2005, HCA announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.5 billion of its common stock. In November 2005, HCA
closed the tender offer and repurchased 28.7 million shares
of the Company’s common stock for $1.437 billion
($50.00 per share). The shares repurchased represented
approximately 6% of the Company’s outstanding shares at the
time of the tender offer. During 2005, HCA also repurchased
8.0 million shares of its common stock for
$412 million, through open market purchases.

In October 2004, HCA announced the authorization of a modified
“Dutch” auction tender offer to purchase up to
$2.501 billion of its common stock. In November 2004, HCA
closed the tender offer and repurchased 62 million shares
of the Company’s common stock for $2.466 billion
($39.75 per share). The shares repurchased represented
approximately 13% of the Company’s outstanding shares at
the time of the tender offer. HCA also repurchased
0.9 million shares of its common stock for
$35 million, through open market purchases, which completed
this $2.501 billion share repurchase authorization.

In April 2003, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase
$1.5 billion of its common stock through open market
purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During 2003, HCA
repurchased under this authorization 25.3 million shares of
its common stock for $900 million, through open market
purchases. During 2004, HCA repurchased 14.5 million shares
of its common stock for $600 million, through open market
purchases, which completed this authorization.

In July 2002, HCA announced an authorization to repurchase up to
12 million shares of its common stock. During 2003, HCA
purchased 5.8 million shares for $214 million, through
open market purchases, which completed the repurchases under
this authorization.

During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the share repurchase transactions
reduced stockholders’ equity by $1.856 billion,
$3.109 billion and $1.114 billion, respectively.

NOTE 11 — STOCK BENEFIT PLANS

In May 2005, the stockholders of HCA approved the HCA 2005
Equity Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). The 2005 Plan
is the primary plan under which options to purchase common stock
and restricted stock may be granted to officers, employees and
directors. Prior to 2005, the Company primarily utilized stock
option grants for equity compensation purposes. During 2005 an
increasing equity compensation emphasis was placed on restricted
share grants. The restricted shares issued in 2005 are subject
to back-end vesting provisions, with no shares vesting in the
first two years after grant and then a third of the shares
vesting in each of the third, fourth and fifth years. During
2005, compensation cost related to restricted share grants under
this plan totaled $24 million. The number of options or
shares authorized under the 2005 Plan is 34,000,000 (which
includes 14,000,000 shares authorized under a former plan).
In addition, options granted under the former plan that are
cancelled become available for subsequent grants. Exercise
provisions vary, but options are generally exercisable, in whole
or in part, beginning one to four years after the grant date and
ending ten years after the grant date.

In December 2004, HCA accelerated the vesting of all unvested
options awarded to employees and officers which had exercise
prices greater than closing price of the Company’s common
stock at December 14, 2004 of $40.89 per share.
Options to purchase approximately 19.1 million shares
became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting
acceleration.

Options to purchase common stock have been granted to officers,
employees and directors under various predecessor plans.
Generally, options have been granted with exercise prices no
less than the market price on the date of grant. Exercise
provisions vary, but most options are exercisable in whole, or
in part, beginning one to five years after the grant date and
ending four to fifteen years after the grant date.

Information regarding these option plans for 2005, 2004 and 2003
is summarized below (share amounts in thousands):

PLANS (Continued)

The following table summarizes information regarding the options
outstanding at December 31, 2005 (share amounts in
thousands):

HCA’s amended and restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(“ESPP”) provides an opportunity to purchase shares of
its common stock at a discount (through payroll deductions over
six-month periods) to substantially all employees. At
December 31, 2005, 4,900,100 shares of common stock
were reserved for purchase under the ESPP provisions.

Under the Management Stock Purchase Plan (“MSPP”), HCA
has made grants of restricted shares or units of HCA’s
common stock to provide equity compensation to employees. The
MSPP allows eligible employees to defer an elected percentage
(not to exceed 25%) of their base salaries through the purchase
of restricted stock at a 25% discount from the average market
price. Purchases of restricted shares are made twice a year and
the shares vest after three years.

At December 31, 2005, 3,747,500 shares were subject to
restrictions, which lapse between 2006 and 2009. During 2005,
2004 and 2003, grants and purchases of 3,130,900, 721,100 and
1,039,900 shares, respectively, were made at
weighted-average grant or purchase date fair values of $44.97,
$44.88 and $42.08 per share, respectively, related to
equity compensation plans. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, grants
and purchases of 145,600, 158,900 and 148,900 shares,
respectively, were made at weighted-average grant or purchase
date discounted (25% discount) fair values of $33.22, $29.64 and
$30.21 per share, respectively, related to the MSPP.

NOTE 12 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

HCA maintains noncontributory, defined contribution retirement
plans covering substantially all employees. Benefits are
determined as a percentage of a participant’s salary and
vest over specified periods of employee service. Retirement plan
expense was $216 million for 2005, $191 million for
2004 and $166 million for 2003. Amounts approximately equal
to retirement plan expense are funded annually.

NOTE 12 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS (Continued)

HCA maintains contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
requirements. Certain of the plans require that HCA match
specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain
maximum levels (generally 50% of the first 3% of compensation
deferred by participants). The cost of these plans totaled
$54 million for 2005, $51 million for 2004 and
$48 million for 2003. HCA’s contributions are funded
periodically during each year.

HCA maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
(“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives a
prescribed life annuity from a combination of the SERP and
HCA’s other benefit plans. Compensation expense under the
plan was $9 million for 2005, $8 million for 2004 and
$7 million for 2003. Accrued benefits liabilities under
this plan totaled $42 million at December 31, 2005 and
$52 million at December 31, 2004.

HCA maintains defined benefit pension plans that resulted from
acquisitions of certain hospitals in prior years. Compensation
expense under these plans was $29 million for 2005,
$26 million for 2004, and $17 million for 2003.
Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled
$56 million at December 31, 2005 and $55 million
at December 31, 2004.

NOTE 13 — SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC
INFORMATION

HCA operates in one line of business, which is operating
hospitals and related health care entities. During the three
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately
27%, 28% and 28%, respectively, of HCA’s revenues related
to patients participating in the Medicare program.

HCA’s operations are structured in two geographically
organized groups: the Eastern Group includes 90 consolidating
hospitals located in the Eastern United States and the Western
Group includes 77 consolidating hospitals located in the Western
United States. HCA also operates eight consolidating hospitals
in England and Switzerland and these facilities are included in
the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
and amortization, interest expense, gains on sales of
facilities, impairment of long-lived assets, government
settlement and investigation related costs, minority interests
and income taxes. HCA uses adjusted segment EBITDA as an
analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to
geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted
segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator
within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of
leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment
EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial
performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and
the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant
components in understanding and assessing financial performance.
Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment
EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly
titled measures of other companies. The
