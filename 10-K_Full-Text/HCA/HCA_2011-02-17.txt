INDEX



PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

HCA Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading health care services
    companies in the United States. At December 31, 2010, we
    operated 164 hospitals, comprised of 158 general, acute care
    hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation
    hospital. The 164 hospital total includes eight hospitals (seven
    general, acute care hospitals and one rehabilitation hospital)
    owned by joint ventures in which an affiliate of HCA is a
    partner, and these joint ventures are accounted for using the
    equity method. In addition, we operated 106 freestanding surgery
    centers, nine of which are owned by joint ventures in which an
    affiliate of HCA is a partner, and these joint ventures are
    accounted for using the equity method. Our facilities are
    located in 20 states and England.

The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,”
    “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless
    otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and
    its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization (as defined
    below) and to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the
    Corporate Reorganization. The term “affiliates” means
    direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and
    partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
    partners. The terms “facilities” or
    “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
    affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to
    employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of
    quality health care services in the most cost-effective manner
    possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a
    full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties
    as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology,
    neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as diagnostic
    and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care
    services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals,
    freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and
    rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
    full range of mental health care services through inpatient,
    partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private
    investor group comprised of affiliates of or funds sponsored by
    Bain Capital Partners, LLC (“Bain Capital”), Kohlberg
    Kravis Roberts & Co. (“KKR”) and Merrill
    Lynch Global Private Equity (“MLGPE”), now BAML
    Capital Partners (each a “Sponsor”), Citigroup Inc.
    and Bank of America Corporation (the “Sponsor
    Assignees”) and HCA founder Dr. Thomas F.
    Frist, Jr. (the “Frist Entities”), a group we
    collectively refer to as the “Investors,” and by
    members of management and certain other investors. We refer to
    the merger, the financing transactions related to the merger and
    other related transactions collectively as the
    “Recapitalization.” The merger was accounted for as a
    recapitalization in our financial statements, with no
    adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and
    liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees. On April 29, 2008,
    we registered our common stock pursuant to Section 12(g) of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), thus subjecting us to the reporting
    requirements of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange
    Act of 1934, as amended. Our common stock is not traded on a
    national securities exchange.

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and
    reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal
    executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville,
    Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is

(615) 344-9551.

Corporate
    Reorganization

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a
    new holding company structure (the “Corporate
    Reorganization”). We are the new parent company, and HCA
    Inc. is now our wholly-owned direct subsidiary. As part of the
    Corporate Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of
    capital stock were automatically converted, on a share for share
    basis, into identical shares of our common stock. Our amended
    and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated
    by-laws, executive officers and board of directors are the same
    as HCA Inc.’s in effect immediately prior to the Corporate
    Reorganization, and the rights, privileges and interests of HCA
    Inc.’s stockholders remain the same with respect to us as
    the new holding company. Additionally, as a result of the



Corporate Reorganization, we are deemed the successor registrant
    to HCA Inc. under the Exchange Act, and shares of our common
    stock are deemed registered under Section 12(g) of the
    Exchange Act. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, we will
    become a guarantor but will not assume the debt of HCA
    Inc.’s outstanding secured notes.

We have assumed all of HCA Inc.’s obligations with respect
    to the outstanding shares previously registered on

Form S-8

for distribution pursuant to HCA Inc.’s stock incentive
    plan and have also assumed HCA Inc.’s other equity
    incentive plans that provide for the right to acquire HCA
    Inc.’s common stock, whether or not exercisable. We have
    also assumed and agreed to perform HCA Inc.’s obligations
    under its other compensation plans and agreements pursuant to
    which HCA Inc. is to issue equity securities to its directors,
    officers, or employees. The agreements and plans we assumed were
    each deemed to be automatically amended as necessary to provide
    that references therein to HCA Inc. now refer to HCA Holdings,
    Inc. Consequently, following the Corporate Reorganization, the
    right to receive HCA Inc.’s common stock under its various
    compensation plans and agreements automatically converted into
    rights for the same number of shares of our common stock, with
    the same rights and conditions as the corresponding HCA Inc.
    rights prior to the Corporate Reorganization.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high
    quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business,
    increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for
    our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our
    efforts around the following growth agenda:

•

grow our presence in existing markets;

•

achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and
    satisfaction measures;

•

recruit and employ physicians to meet need for high quality
    health services;

•

continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance
    profitability; and

•

selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health
    Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate hospitals; freestanding
    surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and
    oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and
    physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2010, we owned and operated 151 general,
    acute care hospitals with 38,321 licensed beds, and an
    additional seven general, acute care hospitals with 2,269
    licensed beds are operated through joint ventures, which are
    accounted for using the equity method. Most of our general,
    acute care hospitals provide medical and



surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care,
    cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The
    general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services
    such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory
    therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an
    organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or
    governing board, made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical
    research and education programs. However, some of our hospitals
    are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the
    clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other
    education programs.

At December 31, 2010, we operated five psychiatric
    hospitals with 506 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
    provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and
    adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug
    abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities which include
    freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”),
    diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive outpatient
    rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, outpatient
    radiation and oncology therapy centers and various other
    facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component
    of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in
    select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through
    partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority
    ownership of each partnership or limited liability company
    typically held by a general partner or subsidiary that is an
    affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management
    services to our health care facilities, including patient safety
    programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply
    contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing contracts;
    accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental
    reimbursement assistance; construction planning and
    coordination; information technology systems and solutions;
    legal counsel; human resources services; and internal audit
    services.

Sources
    of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
    provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and
    the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and
    reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly
    depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
    medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the
    geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels
    fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our
    control.

We receive payment for patient services from the federal
    government under the Medicare program, state governments under
    their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care
    plans, private insurers and directly from patients. The
    approximate percentages of our revenues from such sources were
    as follows:

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and
    medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some
    disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and
    persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a
    federal-state program, administered by the states, which
    provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals
    who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute
    care hospitals located in the United States are certified as
    health care services providers for persons covered under
    Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare
    and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than
    established hospital gross charges for the services provided.



Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges
    to certain group purchasers of health care services, including
    private insurance companies, employers, HMOs, PPOs and other
    managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit our
    ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs.
    See Item 1, “Business — Competition.”
    Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference
    between established hospital gross charges and amounts
    reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs or
    PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the
    extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of
    their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and
    coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due
    from individuals is typically more difficult than from
    governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to
    uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity
    care under our charity care policy. These discounts are similar
    to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an
    uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the
    uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

Inpatient
    Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a
    prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute
    care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient
    PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are
    established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare
    severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). The
    Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
    (“CMS”) completed a two-year transition to full
    implementation of MS-DRGs to replace the previously used
    Medicare diagnosis related groups in an effort to better
    recognize severity of illness in Medicare payment rates. MS-DRGs
    classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated
    intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for
    each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average
    resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources
    for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage
    differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as
    “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital
    costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically
    adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients
    falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically
    receive additional “outlier” payments.

MS-DRG rates are updated and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated
    using cost relative weights each federal fiscal year (which
    begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates
    (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the
    inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the
    health care industry in purchasing goods and services. The
    Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the
    Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010
    (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”) provides for
    annual decreases to the market basket, including a 0.25%
    reduction in 2010 for discharges occurring on or after
    April 1, 2010. The Health Reform Law also provides for the
    following reductions to the market basket update for each of the
    following federal fiscal years: 0.25% in 2011, 0.1% in 2012 and
    2013, 0.3% in 2014, 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017,
    2018 and 2019. For federal fiscal year 2012 and each subsequent
    federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the
    annual market basket update to be further reduced by a
    productivity adjustment. The amount of that reduction will be
    the projected, nationwide productivity gains over the preceding
    10 years. To determine the projection, the Department of
    Health and Human Services (“HHS”) will use the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics (“BLS”)

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old). The Health Reform
    Law does not contain guidelines for use by HHS in projecting the
    productivity figure. Based upon the latest available data,
    federal fiscal year 2012 market basket reductions resulting from
    this productivity adjustment are likely to range from 1.0% to
    1.4%. CMS estimates that the combined market basket and
    productivity adjustments will reduce Medicare payments under the
    inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019. A
    decrease in payments rates or an increase in rates that is below
    the increase in our costs may adversely affect the results of
    our operations.

For federal fiscal year 2010, CMS initially set the MS-DRG rate
    increase at the full market basket of 2.1%, but CMS reduced the
    increase to 1.85% for discharges occurring on or after
    April 1, 2010, as required by the Health Reform Law. For
    federal fiscal year 2011, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate for
    federal fiscal year 2011 by 2.35%, representing the full market
    basket of 2.6% minus the 0.25% reduction required by the Health
    Reform Law. CMS also applied a documentation and coding
    adjustment of negative 2.9% in federal fiscal year 2011 to
    account for



increases in aggregate payments during implementation of the
    MS-DRG system. This reduction represents half of the
    documentation and coding adjustment that CMS intends to
    implement. CMS plans to recover the remaining 2.9% and interest
    in federal fiscal year 2012. The market basket update and the
    documentation and coding adjustment together result in an
    aggregate market basket adjustment for federal fiscal year 2011
    of negative 0.55%. CMS has also announced that an additional
    prospective negative adjustment of 3.9% will be needed to avoid
    increased Medicare spending unrelated to patient severity of
    illness. CMS did not implement this additional 3.9% reduction in
    federal fiscal year 2011 but has stated that it will be required
    in the future.

Further realignments in the MS-DRG system could also reduce the
    payments we receive for certain specialties, including
    cardiology and orthopedics. CMS has focused on payment levels
    for such specialties in recent years in part because of the
    proliferation of specialty hospitals. Changes in the payments
    received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization
    Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provides for hospitals to receive
    a 2% reduction to their market basket updates if they fail to
    submit data for patient care quality indicators to the Secretary
    of HHS. As required by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005
    (“DRA 2005”), CMS has expanded, through a series of
    rulemakings, the number of quality measures that must be
    reported to avoid the market basket reduction. In federal fiscal
    year 2011, CMS requires hospitals to report 55 quality measures
    in order to avoid the market basket reduction for inpatient PPS
    payments in federal fiscal year 2012. All of our hospitals paid
    under the Medicare inpatient PPS are participating in the
    quality initiative by submitting the requested quality data.
    While we will endeavor to comply with all data submission
    requirements as additional requirements continue to be added,
    our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to
    entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of our
    hospitals.

As part of CMS’ goal of transforming Medicare from a
    passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and
    services, for discharges occurring after October 1, 2008,
    Medicare no longer assigns an inpatient hospital discharge to a
    higher paying MS-DRG if a selected hospital acquired condition
    (“HAC”) was not present on admission. In this
    situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis
    was not present. Currently, there are ten categories of
    conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS has established
    three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare
    reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an
    inpatient or outpatient basis. The Health Reform Law provides
    for reduced payments based on a hospital’s HAC rates.
    Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with
    the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year
    will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating
    Medicare payments. In addition, effective July 1, 2011, the
    Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal funds under the
    Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services
    provided to treat HACs.

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to
    hospitals based on readmission rates. Beginning in federal
    fiscal year 2013, inpatient payments will be reduced if a
    hospital experiences “excessive” readmissions within a
    time period specified by HHS from the date of discharge for
    heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions
    designated by HHS. Hospitals with what HHS defines as excessive
    readmissions for these conditions will receive reduced payments
    for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to
    the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.
    Each hospital’s performance will be publicly reported by
    HHS. HHS has the discretion to determine what
    “excessive” readmissions means and other terms and
    conditions of this program.

The Health Reform Law additionally establishes a value-based
    purchasing program to further link payments to quality and
    efficiency. In federal fiscal year 2013, HHS is directed to
    implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient
    hospital services. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, CMS
    will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges
    by the following: 1% for 2013; 1.25% for 2014; 1.5% for 2015;
    1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. For each
    federal fiscal year, the total amount collected from these
    reductions will be pooled and used to fund payments to reward
    hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards
    established by HHS. HHS will determine the quality performance
    measures, the standards hospitals must achieve in order to meet
    the quality performance measures and the methodology for
    calculating payments to hospitals that meet the required quality
    threshold. HHS will also determine the amount each hospital that
    meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive
    from the pool of dollars created by the reductions related to
    the value-based



purchasing program. On January 7, 2011, CMS issued a
    proposed rule for the value-based purchasing program that would
    use 17 clinical process of care measures and eight dimensions of
    a patient’s experience of care using the Hospital Consumer
    Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems
    (“HCAHPS”) survey to determine incentive payments for
    federal fiscal year 2013. As proposed, the incentive payments
    would be calculated based on a combination of measures of
    hospitals’ achievement of the performance standards and
    their improvement in meeting the performance standards compared
    to prior periods. To determine payments in federal fiscal year
    2013, the baseline performance period (measurement standard) as
    proposed would be July 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010.
    To determine whether hospitals meet performance standards, CMS
    would compare each hospital’s performance in the period
    July 1, 2011 through March 31, 2012 to its performance
    in the baseline performance period. CMS has not yet proposed
    specific threshold values for the performance standards. CMS
    also proposes to add three outcome measures for federal fiscal
    year 2014, for which the performance period would be
    July 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012 and the
    baseline performance period would be July 1, 2008 through
    December 31, 2009.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of
    Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For
    federal fiscal year 2010, CMS established an outlier threshold
    of $23,140, and for federal fiscal year 2011, CMS reduced the
    outlier threshold to $23,075. We do not anticipate that the
    decrease to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2011
    will have a material impact on our results of operations.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain
    Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients
    who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee
    schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech
    therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic
    laboratory services and nonimplantable orthotics and
    prosthetics, freestanding surgery centers services and services
    provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities.

Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into
    groups called ambulatory payment classifications
    (“APCs”). Services for each APC are similar clinically
    and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is
    established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a
    hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit.
    The APC payment rates were updated for calendar years 2008 and
    2009 by market baskets of 3.30% and 3.60%, respectively. CMS
    updated payment rates for calendar year 2010 by the full market
    basket of 2.1%. However, the Health Reform Law includes a 0.25%
    reduction to the market basket for 2010. The Health Reform Law
    also provides for the following reductions to the market basket
    update for each of the following calendar years: 0.25% in 2011,
    0.1% in 2012 and 2013, 0.3% in 2014, 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and
    0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For calendar year 2011, CMS
    implemented a market basket update of 2.6%. With the 0.25%
    reduction required by the Health Reform Law, this update results
    in a market basket increase of 2.35%. For calendar year 2012 and
    each subsequent calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides
    for an annual market basket update to be further reduced by a
    productivity adjustment. The amount of that reduction will be
    the projected, nationwide productivity gains over the preceding
    10 years. To determine the projection, HHS will use the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old). The Health Reform
    Law does not contain guidelines for use by HHS in projecting the
    productivity figure. However, CMS estimates that the combined
    market basket and productivity adjustments will reduce Medicare
    payments under the outpatient PPS by $26.3 billion from
    2010 to 2019. CMS continues to require hospitals to submit
    quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2%
    reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS.
    CMS required hospitals to report data on 11 quality
    measures in calendar year 2010 for the payment determination in
    calendar year 2011 and requires hospitals to report
    15 quality measures in calendar year 2011 to avoid reduced
    payments in calendar year 2012.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities
    (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under IRF PPS, patients are
    classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age,
    comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the
    patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a
    predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the
    patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage
    levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers.
    CMS provided for a market basket update of 2.5% for federal
    fiscal year 2010. However, the Health



Reform Law requires a 0.25% reduction to the market basket for
    2010 for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2010.
    The Health Reform Law also provides for the following reductions
    to the market basket update for each of the following federal
    fiscal years: 0.25% in 2011, 0.1% in 2012 and 2013, 0.3% in
    2014, 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
    For federal fiscal year 2011, CMS implemented a market basket
    update of 2.5%. With the 0.25% reduction required by the Health
    Reform Law, this update results in a market basket increase of
    2.25% for federal fiscal year 2011. For federal fiscal year 2012
    and each subsequent federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law
    provides for the annual market basket update to be further
    reduced by a productivity adjustment. The amount of that
    reduction will be the projected, nationwide productivity gains
    over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection,
    HHS will use the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old). The Health Reform
    Law does not contain guidelines for use by HHS in projecting the
    productivity figure. However, CMS estimates that the combined
    market basket and productivity adjustments will reduce Medicare
    payments under the IRF PPS by $5.7 billion from 2010 to
    2019. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, IRFs will be
    required to report quality measures to CMS or will receive a two
    percentage point reduction to the market basket update. As of
    December 31, 2010, we had one rehabilitation hospital,
    which is operated through a joint venture, and 43 hospital
    rehabilitation units.

On May 7, 2004, CMS published a final rule to change the
    criteria for being classified as an IRF. Pursuant to that final
    rule, 75% of a facility’s inpatients over a given year had
    to have been treated for at least one of 10 specified
    conditions, and a subsequent regulation expanded the number of
    specified conditions to 13. Since then, several statutory and
    regulatory adjustments have been made to the rule, including
    adjustments to the percentage of a facility’s patients that
    must be treated for one of the 13 specified conditions.
    Currently, the compliance threshold is set by statute at 60%.
    Implementation of this 60% threshold has reduced our IRF
    admissions and can be expected to continue to restrict the
    treatment of patients whose medical conditions do not meet any
    of the 13 approved conditions. In addition, effective
    January 1, 2010, IRFs must meet additional coverage
    criteria, including patient selection and care requirements
    relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission
    evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of
    rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60%
    threshold or other criteria to be classified as an IRF will be
    paid under the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS,
    which generally provide for lower payment amounts.

Psychiatric

Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals
    and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and
    critical access hospitals are reimbursed under a prospective
    payment system (“IPF PPS”), a per diem payment, with
    adjustments to account for certain patient and facility
    characteristics. IPF PPS contains an “outlier” policy
    for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a
    facility’s base payment if it maintains a full-service
    emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment
    rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral and has adopted a
    July 1 update cycle, with each twelve month period referred to
    as a “rate year.” CMS issued a proposed rule that
    includes changing the IPF PPS from the rate year update cycle to
    a fiscal year schedule. If implemented as proposed, the rates
    for 2012 would be effective from July 1, 2011 through
    September 30, 2012, with future updates coinciding with the
    federal fiscal year (from October 1 through September 30).
    The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care
    (“RPL”) market basket update is used to update the IPF
    PPS. The annual RPL market basket update for rate year 2010 was
    2.1%, and the annual RPL market basket update for rate year 2011
    is 2.4%. However, the Health Reform Law includes a 0.25%
    reduction to the market basket for rate year 2010 and again in
    2011. The Health Reform Law also provides for the following
    reductions to the market basket update for rate years that begin
    in the following calendar years: 0.1% in 2012 and 2013, 0.3% in
    2014, 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
    For rate year 2012 and each subsequent rate year, the Health
    Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be
    further reduced by a productivity adjustment. The amount of that
    reduction will be the projected, nationwide productivity gains
    over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection,
    HHS will use the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old). The Health Reform
    Law does not contain guidelines for use by HHS in projecting the
    productivity figure. However, CMS estimates that the combined
    market basket and productivity adjustments will reduce Medicare
    payments under the IPF PPS by $4.3 billion from 2010 to
    2019.  In a proposed rule, CMS proposes a market basket update
    of 3.0% for rate year 2012. If implemented as proposed, and with
    the 0.25% reduction



required by the Health Reform Law, this would result in a market
    basket update of 2.75%. As of December 31, 2010, we had
    five psychiatric hospitals and 35 hospital psychiatric units.

Ambulatory
    Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule.
    Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more
    than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments
    under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same
    procedure. Effective January 1, 2008, ASC payment groups
    increased from nine clinically disparate payment groups to an
    extensive list of covered surgical procedures among the APCs
    used under the outpatient PPS for these surgical services.
    Because the new payment system has a significant impact on
    payments for certain procedures, for services previously in the
    nine payment groups, CMS has established a four-year transition
    period for implementing the required payment rates. Moreover, if
    CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a
    physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that
    procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the
    Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited
    exceptions. In addition, all surgical procedures, other than
    those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require
    an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. As a result,
    more Medicare procedures now performed in hospitals may be moved
    to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more
    Medicare procedures now performed in ASCs may be moved to
    physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may
    adopt similar policies. The Health Reform Law requires HHS to
    issue a plan by January 1, 2011 for developing a
    value-based purchasing program for ASCs, but HHS has not yet
    publicly issued this plan. Such a program may further impact
    Medicare reimbursement of ASCs or increase our operating costs
    in order to satisfy the value-based standards. For federal
    fiscal year 2011 and each subsequent federal fiscal year, the
    Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update
    to be reduced by a productivity adjustment. The amount of that
    reduction will be the projected nationwide productivity gains
    over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection,
    HHS will use the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old).

Physician
    Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee
    schedule (“PFS”) system, under which CMS has assigned
    a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical
    procedures and services that reflects the various resources
    required by a physician to provide the services relative to all
    other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of
    work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the
    service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service
    and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service.
    These three elements are each modified by a geographic
    adjustment factor to account for local practice costs then
    aggregated. The aggregated amount is multiplied by a conversion
    factor that accounts for inflation and targeted growth in
    Medicare expenditures (as calculated by the sustainable growth
    rate (“SGR”)) to arrive at the payment amount for each
    service. While RVUs for various services may change in a given
    year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually
    budget neutral, such that total payments made under the PFS may
    not differ by more than $20 million from what payments
    would have been if adjustments were not made.

The PFS rates are adjusted each year, and reductions in both
    current and future payments are anticipated. The SGR formula, if
    implemented as mandated by statute, would result in significant
    reductions to payments under the PFS. Since 2003, the
    U.S. Congress has passed multiple legislative acts delaying
    application of the SGR to the PFS. For calendar year 2011, CMS
    issued a final rule that would have applied the SGR and resulted
    in an aggregate reduction of 24.9% to all physician payments
    under the PFS for federal fiscal year 2011. On December 15,
    2010, President Obama signed legislation delaying application of
    the SGR until January 1, 2012. We cannot predict whether
    the U.S. Congress will intervene to prevent this reduction
    to payments in the future.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area
    differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
    reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area
    compared to the national average wage level. Beginning in
    federal fiscal year 2007, CMS adjusted 100% of the wage index
    factor for occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage
    index changes, while slightly negative in the aggregate, is not
    anticipated to have a material



financial impact for 2011. However, the Health Reform Law
    requires HHS to report to Congress by December 31, 2011
    with recommendations on how to comprehensively reform the
    Medicare wage index system.

As required by the MMA, CMS is implementing contractor reform
    whereby CMS has competitively bid the Medicare fiscal
    intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare
    Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are
    geographically assigned and service both Part A and
    Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. Although CMS
    has awarded initial contracts to all 15 MAC jurisdictions, full
    transition to the MAC jurisdictions has been delayed due to CMS
    resoliciting some bids and implementing other corrective actions
    in response to filed protests. While chain providers had the
    option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, HCA
    chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which
    our hospitals are located. The individual MAC jurisdictions are
    in varying phases of transition. During the transition periods
    and for a potentially unforeseen period thereafter, all of these
    changes could impact claims processing functions and the
    resulting cash flow; however, we are unable to predict the
    impact at this time.

Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program,
    CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct
    post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in
    the fee-for-service Medicare program. The RAC program was
    originally limited to certain states, but in 2010, CMS
    implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis as
    required by statute.

The U.S. Congress has not permanently addressed the SGR
    reductions in physician compensation under the PFS. Any repeal
    of the SGR may be offset by reductions in Medicare payments to
    other types of providers.

Managed
    Medicare

Managed Medicare plans relate to situations where a private
    company contracts with CMS to provide members with Medicare
    Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed
    Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private

fee-for-service

plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries to choose
    enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. In 2003, MMA
    increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and expanded
    Medicare beneficiaries’ health care options. Since 2003,
    the number of beneficiaries choosing to receive their Medicare
    benefits through such plans has increased. However, the Medicare
    Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 imposed new
    restrictions and implemented focused cuts to certain managed
    Medicare plans. In addition, the Health Reform Law reduces, over
    a three year period, premium payments to managed Medicare plans
    such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments
    are, on average, equal to traditional Medicare. The Health
    Reform Law also implements fee payment adjustments based on
    service benchmarks and quality ratings. The Congressional Budget
    Office (“CBO”) has estimated that, as a result of
    these changes, payments to plans will be reduced by
    $138 billion between 2010 and 2019, while CMS has estimated
    the reduction to be $145 billion. In addition, the Health
    Reform Law expands the RAC program to include managed Medicare
    plans. In light of the current economic downturn and the Health
    Reform Law, managed Medicare plans may experience reduced
    premium payments, which may lead to decreased enrollment in such
    plans.

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government
    and the states and are administered by states under approved
    plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS
    or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual
    hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a
    hospital’s cost of services. The Health Reform Law also
    requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals
    under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty
    level (“FPL”) by 2014. However, the Health Reform Law
    also requires states to apply a “5% income disregard”
    to the Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid
    eligibility will effectively be extended to those with incomes
    up to 138% of the FPL. In addition, effective July 1, 2011,
    the Health Reform Law will prohibit the use of federal funds
    under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical
    assistance provided to treat HACs.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program,
    states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation
    designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current
    economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most
    states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely
    will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased
    spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. The
    American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
    (“ARRA”) allocated approximately $87.0 billion to
    temporarily increase the share of program costs paid by the
    federal government to fund each state’s Medicaid program.



Although initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2010,
    Congress has allocated additional funds to extend this increased
    federal funding to states through June 2011. These funds have
    helped avoid more extensive program and reimbursement cuts, but
    the expiration of the increased federal funding could result in
    significant reductions to state Medicaid programs.

Further, as permitted by law, certain states in which we operate
    have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal
    share of Medicaid programs. Many states have also adopted, or
    are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll
    Medicaid recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems. Effective March 23,
    2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain
    Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the
    enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and
    for children until October 1, 2019. However, states with
    budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to
    address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more
    than 133% of the FPL.

Through DRA 2005, Congress has expanded the federal
    government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse
    in the Medicaid program by creating the Medicaid Integrity
    Program. Among other things, DRA 2005 requires CMS to employ
    private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity
    Contractors (“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits
    of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned
    to five geographic regions and have commenced audits in states
    assigned to those regions. The Health Reform Law increases
    federal funding for the MIC program for federal fiscal year 2011
    and later years. In addition to MICs, several other contractors
    and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review
    activities. The Health Reform Law expands the RAC program’s
    scope to include Medicaid claims.

Managed
    Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or
    more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims
    adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program
    responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core
    benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of
    the designated entities, usually a managed care organization.
    The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent
    years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid
    programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in
    which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to
    these plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans.

Electronic
    Health Records

ARRA provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments
    beginning in federal fiscal year 2011 for eligible hospitals and
    calendar year 2011 for eligible professionals that adopt and
    meaningfully use certified electronic health record
    (“EHR”) technology. A total of at least
    $20 billion in incentives is being made available through
    the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible
    hospitals and eligible professionals in the adoption of EHRs.

Under the Medicare incentive program, acute care hospitals that
    demonstrate meaningful use will receive incentive payments for
    up to four fiscal years. The Medicare incentive payment amount
    is the product of three factors: (1) an initial amount
    comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000 plus $200 for each
    acute care inpatient discharge during a payment year, beginning
    with a hospital’s 1,150th discharge of the year and
    ending with a hospital’s 23,000th discharge of the
    year; (2) the “Medicare share,” which is the sum
    of Medicare Part A and Part C acute care
    inpatient-bed-days divided by the product of the total
    inpatient-bed-days and a charity care factor; and (3) a
    transition factor applicable to the payment year. In order to
    maximize their incentive payments, acute care hospitals must
    participate in the incentive program by federal fiscal year
    2013. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, acute care
    hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified
    EHR technology will receive reduced market basket updates under
    inpatient PPS.

Eligible professionals who demonstrate meaningful use are
    entitled to incentive payments for up to five payment years in
    an amount equal to 75% of their estimated Medicare allowed
    charges for covered professional services furnished during the
    relevant calendar year, subject to an annual limit. Eligible
    professionals must participate in the incentive payment program
    by calendar year 2012 in order to maximize their incentive
    payments and must participate by calendar year 2014 in order to
    receive any incentive payments. Beginning in calendar year



2015, eligible professionals who do not demonstrate meaningful
    use of certified EHR technology will face Medicare payment
    reductions.

The Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntary for states to
    implement. For participating states, the Medicaid EHR incentive
    program will provide incentive payments for acute care hospitals
    and eligible professionals that meet certain volume percentages
    of Medicaid patients as well as children’s hospitals.
    Providers may only participate in a single state’s Medicaid
    EHR incentive program. Eligible professionals can only
    participate in either the Medicaid incentive program or the
    Medicare incentive program and can change this election only one
    time. Hospitals may participate in both the Medicare and
    Medicaid incentive programs.

To qualify for incentive payments under the Medicaid program,
    providers must adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate
    meaningful use of, certified EHR technology during their first
    participation year or successfully demonstrate meaningful use of
    certified EHR technology in subsequent participation years.
    Payments may be received for up to six participation years. For
    hospitals, the aggregate Medicaid EHR incentive amount is the
    product of two factors: (1) the overall EHR amount which is
    comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000 plus a

discharge-related

amount, multiplied by the Medicare share (which is set at one by
    statute) multiplied by a transition factor, and (2) the
    “Medicaid share,” which is the estimated Medicaid
    inpatient-bed days plus estimated Medicaid managed care
    inpatient

bed-days,

divided by the product of the estimated total inpatient

bed-days

and
    a charity care factor. Under the Medicaid incentive program,
    eligible professionals may receive payments based on their EHR
    costs, up to total amount of $63,750, or for pediatricians,
    $42,500. There is no penalty for hospitals or professionals
    under Medicaid for failing to meet EHR meaningful use
    requirements.

Accountable
    Care Organizations and Pilot Projects

The Health Reform Law requires HHS to establish a Medicare
    Shared Savings Program that promotes accountability and
    coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care
    Organizations (“ACOs”), beginning no later than
    January 1, 2012. The program will allow providers
    (including hospitals), physicians and other designated
    professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and voluntarily
    work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery
    processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of
    services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result
    of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that
    achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be
    eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the
    Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine
    key elements of the program, including what steps providers must
    take to be considered an ACO, how to decide if Medicare program
    savings have occurred, and what portion of such savings will be
    paid to ACOs. In addition, HHS will determine to what degree
    hospitals, physicians and other eligible participants will be
    able to form and operate an ACO without violating certain
    existing laws, including the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law. The Health Reform Law
    does not authorize HHS to waive other laws that may impact the
    ability of hospitals and other eligible participants to
    participate in ACOs, such as antitrust laws.

The Health Reform Law requires HHS to establish a five-year,
    voluntary national bundled payment pilot program for Medicare
    services beginning no later than January 1, 2013. Under the
    program, providers would agree to receive one payment for
    services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical
    conditions or episodes of care. HHS will have the discretion to
    determine how the program will function. For example, HHS will
    determine what medical conditions will be included in the
    program and the amount of the payment for each condition. In
    addition, the Health Reform Law provides for a five-year bundled
    payment pilot program for Medicaid services to begin
    January 1, 2012. HHS will select up to eight states to
    participate based on the potential to lower costs under the
    Medicaid program while improving care. State programs may target
    particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or
    geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs
    will provide one payment for both hospital and physician
    services provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of
    inpatient care. For both pilot programs, HHS will determine the
    relationship between the programs and restrictions in certain
    existing laws, including the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the Health Insurance
    Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”)
    privacy, security and transaction standard requirements.
    However, the Health Reform Law does not authorize HHS to waive
    other laws that may impact the ability of hospitals and other
    eligible participants to participate in the pilot programs, such
    as antitrust laws.



Disproportionate
    Share Hospital Payments

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to
    beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals
    that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income
    patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive
    Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate share hospital
    (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based on
    certain statistical information required by HHS and are
    calculated as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. The
    primary method used by a hospital to qualify for Medicare DSH
    payments is a complex statutory formula that results in a DSH
    percentage that is applied to payments on MS-DRGs.

Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year
    2014, Medicare DSH payments will be reduced to 25% of the amount
    they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75%
    of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH
    will be effectively pooled, and this pool will be reduced
    further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the
    national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age.
    Each DSH hospital will then be paid, out of the reduced DSH
    payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its level of
    uncompensated care. It is difficult to predict the full impact
    of the Medicare DSH reductions. The CBO estimates
    $22 billion in reductions to Medicare DSH payments between
    2010 and 2019, while for the same time period, CMS estimates
    reimbursement reductions totaling $50 billion.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number
    of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The
    federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to
    each state based on a statutory formula. The states then
    distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States
    have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for
    Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The
    Health Reform Law will reduce funding for the Medicaid DSH
    hospital program in federal fiscal years 2014 through 2020 by
    the following amounts: 2014 ($500 million); 2015
    ($600 million); 2016 ($600 million); 2017
    ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion); 2019
    ($5.6 billion); and 2020 ($4 billion). How such cuts
    are allocated among the states and how the states allocate these
    cuts among providers, have yet to be determined.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program
    for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE
    reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the
    Medicare inpatient PPS. The Department of Defense has also
    implemented a PPS for hospital outpatient services furnished to
    TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for services
    furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the Medicare
    outpatient PPS APC rates have historically been below TRICARE
    rates, the adoption of this payment methodology for TRICARE
    beneficiaries has reduced our reimbursement; however, TRICARE
    outpatient services do not represent a significant portion of
    our patient volumes.

Annual
    Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and
    TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
    under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting
    requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations
    require the submission of annual cost reports covering the
    revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
    provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid
    recipients.

Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in
    adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us
    under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require
    several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to
    or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of
    appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of
    cost reports.

Managed
    Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges
    to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
    including managed care plans and private insurance companies.
    Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other
    insurers were 32%, 34% and 35% of our total admissions for the
    years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms
    between one and three years. While we generally received annual
    average yield increases of 5% to 6% from managed care payers
    during 2010, there can be no assurance that we will continue to
    receive increases in the future. It is not clear what impact, if



any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other
    health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our
    ability to negotiate reimbursement increases.

Uninsured
    and Self-Pay Patients

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially
    admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended
    December 31, 2010, approximately 82% of our admissions of
    uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The
    Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
    the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. The Health
    Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for
    emergency services provided to enrollees without prior
    authorization and without regard to whether a participating
    provider contract is in place. Further, as enacted, the Health
    Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number
    of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives,
    which do not become effective until 2014, for individuals to
    obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage.
    These mandates may reduce the financial impact of screening for
    and stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, many
    factors are unknown regarding the impact of the Health Reform
    Law, including how many previously uninsured individuals will
    obtain coverage as a result of the law or the change, if any, in
    the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that
    are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals
    and the payer mix. In addition, it is difficult to predict the
    full impact of the Health Reform Law due to the law’s
    complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive
    guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation,
    pending court challenges and possible amendment or repeal.

We are taking proactive measures to reduce our provision for
    doubtful accounts by, among other things:

•

screening all patients, including the uninsured, through our
    emergency screening protocol, to determine the appropriate care
    setting in light of their condition, while reducing the
    potential for bad debt; and

•

increasing up-front collections from patients subject to co-pay
    and deductible requirements and uninsured patients.



Hospital
    Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall
    utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of
    the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other
    health care professionals providing patient care within the
    facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be
    a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level
    of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for
    patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization
    include the growth in local population, local economic
    conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for
    our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are
    subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in
    patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the
    cold weather months. The data set forth in this table includes
    only those facilities that are consolidated for financial
    reporting purposes.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by
    most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered
    by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of
    freestanding ASCs and diagnostic centers (including facilities
    owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which we operate
    has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals
    operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases,
    competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals.
    Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported government
    agencies and many others are owned by

not-for-profit

entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable
    contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes.
    Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals.
    In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that
    provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services
    which may not be available at most of our hospitals. We face
    increasing competition from specialty hospitals, some of which
    are physician-owned, and both our own and unaffiliated
    freestanding ASCs for market share in high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas
    outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric
    hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals,
    including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
    competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local
    communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality
    of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians,
    skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals,
    location, breadth of services, technology offered and prices
    charged. The Health Reform Law requires hospitals to publish
    annually a list of their standard charges for items and
    services. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient
    services with improved accessibility and more convenient service
    for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for
    physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position
    of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
    affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians
    may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we
    operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied
    specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract
    other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients
    to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services
    it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians
    on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the
    quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and
    employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide
    quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for
    physicians and patients.

Another major factor in the competitive position of a hospital
    is our ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of
    group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct
    and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts
    from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition,
    employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to
    contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed
    care programs and discounts from established gross charges.
    Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group
    health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market
    reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services,
    quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success
    will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our
    managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts
    on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our
    ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate
    increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and
    conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate
    exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise
    restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with
    us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers
    tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In
    addition, as various provisions of the Health Reform Law are
    implemented, including the establishment of American Health
    Benefit Exchanges (“Exchanges”) and limitations on
    rescissions of coverage and pre-existing condition exclusions,
    non-government payers may increasingly demand reduced fees or be
    unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. The importance
    of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies
    from community to community, depending on the market strength of
    such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place
    limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
    services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise
    make changes in operations, may also have the effect of
    restricting competition. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. Before issuing a
    CON, these states consider the need for additional or expanded
    health care facilities or services. In



those states which have no CON laws or which set relatively high
    levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state
    authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities
    and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1,
    “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of
    continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with
    rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in
    medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations
    and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider
    services by private and government payers remain ongoing
    challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts
    continue to be negatively affected by payer-required
    pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer
    pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care
    delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health
    Reform Law potentially expands the use of prepayment review by
    Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on
    their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and
    payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these
    challenges, we intend to expand our facilities or acquire or
    construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the
    provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer
    market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade
    facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and
    services.

Regulation
    and Other Factors

Licensure,
    Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to
    numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the
    adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating
    policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire
    prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and
    environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
    periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to
    assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary
    for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care
    facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
    Each of our acute care hospitals are certified for participation
    in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and are accredited by The
    Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or
    Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive
    reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility
    were to lose accreditation by The Joint Commission, the facility
    would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to
    increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from
    non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in
    substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state,
    local and independent review body regulations and standards. The
    requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are
    subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may
    become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities,
    equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for
    licensure also may include notification or approval in the event
    of the transfer or change of ownership. Failure to obtain the
    necessary state approval in these circumstances can result in
    the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership.

Certificates
    of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care
    facilities, the construction or expansion of health care
    facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer
    or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services
    may be subject to review by and prior approval of state
    regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally
    require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need
    for additional or expanded health care facilities and services.
    Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in the
    inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
    change ownership.

State
    Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget
    review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues,
    assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care
    within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have
    not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.
    Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that
    mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we
    will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states
    in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating
    such reviews.



Federal
    Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute
    and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with
    the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and
    Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the
    hospital’s participation in the federal health care
    programs may be terminated, or civil

and/or

criminal penalties may be imposed.

Anti-kickback
    Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the
    “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others
    from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or
    paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals
    or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care
    program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held
    that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just
    one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even
    if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health
    Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to
    violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback
    Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for
    each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to
    $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times the total
    amount of the remuneration

and/or

exclusion from participation in federal health care programs,
    including Medicare and Medicaid. The Health Reform Law provides
    that submission of a claim for services or items generated in
    violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or
    fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties
    under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”).

The Office of Inspector General at HHS (“OIG”), among
    other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and
    eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this
    mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
    and inspections. As one means of providing guidance to health
    care providers, the OIG issues “Special Fraud Alerts.”
    These alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features
    of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may
    cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the
    Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG
    has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute
    suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive
    by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the
    hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted
    office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to
    the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly
    discounted billing, nursing or other staff services,
    (d) free training for a physician’s office staff in
    areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques,
    (e) guarantees which provide, if the physician’s
    income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will
    pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or
    interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a
    physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of
    the costs of a physician’s travel and expenses for
    conferences, (h) coverage on the hospital’s group
    health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the
    physician, (i) payment for services (which may include
    consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any,
    substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods
    or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair
    market value, and (k) rental of space in physician offices,
    at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to
    which physicians refer. The OIG has encouraged persons having
    information about hospitals who offer the above types of
    incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of
    providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins,
    along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain
    arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by
    government enforcement authorities, including:
    (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
    venture arrangements between those in a position to refer
    business, such as physicians, and those providing items or
    services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and
    (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the
    practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a
    hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to
    the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory
    Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for
    certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance
    identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse
    statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include
    compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment
    arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships
    with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor
    regulations that outline categories of activities deemed
    protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute.
    Currently, there are statutory exceptions and



safe harbors for various activities, including the following:
    certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental,
    practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management
    contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties,
    discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of
    beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care
    arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies,
    investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers,
    ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty
    services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall
    within a safe harbor, or it is identified in a Special Fraud
    Alert or Advisory Bulletin or as a risk area in the Supplemental
    Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals, does not necessarily render
    the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the
    Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business
    arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government
    enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and
    others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to
    our hospitals and other health care facilities, including
    employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and
    professional service agreements. We also have similar
    relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients
    are referred from our facilities. In addition, we provide
    financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to
    recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals.
    While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors,
    certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures
    and financial relationships with physicians and other referral
    sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do
    not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other
    referral sources have been structured to comply with current law
    and available interpretations, there can be no assurance
    regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these
    financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or
    other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us
    to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws,
    including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and
    exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other
    federal health care programs.

Stark
    Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known
    as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits physicians
    from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with
    which they or any of their immediate family members have a
    financial relationship, if these entities provide certain
    “designated health services” reimbursable by Medicare
    or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also
    prohibits entities that provide designated health services
    reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare
    and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from
    a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund
    amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the
    prohibited referral. “Designated health services”
    include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical
    laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for
    violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil
    monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per claim submitted and
    exclusion from the federal health care programs. The statute
    also provides for a penalty of up to $100,000 for a
    circumvention scheme. There are exceptions to the self-referral
    prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements
    between physicians and providers, including employment
    contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe
    harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is
    voluntary, an arrangement must comply with every requirement of
    a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the
    Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physician’s
    ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law
    prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing
    for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a
    result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new
    physician-owned hospitals after December 31, 2010. While
    the Health Reform Law grandfathers existing physician-owned
    hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the
    percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts
    their ability to expand services.

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final
    regulations implementing the Stark Law. Additional changes to
    these regulations, which became effective October 1, 2009,
    further restrict the types of arrangements facilities and
    physicians may enter, including additional restrictions on
    certain leases, percentage compensation arrangements, and
    agreements under which a hospital purchases services “under
    arrangements.” While these regulations were intended to
    clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it
    is unclear how the government will interpret many of these
    exceptions for enforcement purposes. CMS has indicated it is
    considering



additional changes to the Stark Law regulations. We do not
    always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial
    interpretation of these laws and regulations. We attempt to
    structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark
    Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are
    detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every
    relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

Similar
    State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the
    Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for
    patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that
    prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws
    is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the source of
    payment for care, and little precedent exists for their
    interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide
    for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility
    licensure.

Other
    Fraud and Abuse Provisions

HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by
    adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud
    offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social
    Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for
    making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid.
    False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for
    services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services
    rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for
    unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal
    enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare
    and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees
    associated with business entities that have committed health
    care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no
    knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be
    imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including
    failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing
    arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in
    excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration
    to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection
    of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or
    entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program,
    making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or
    limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in
    return for referring an individual for an item or service
    payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback
    Statute, these provisions are very broad. Under the Health
    Reform Law, civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to
    report and return an overpayment within 60 days of
    identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost
    report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers
    must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims
    for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately
    prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary
    Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud
    and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil
    monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and
    in some cases may result in penalties of up to three times the
    remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition,
    a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state
    health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly
    use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where
    they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof
    requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further,
    individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information
    on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at
    least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity
    Program.

The
    Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

The

qui tam

, or whistleblower, provisions of the FCA
    allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the
    government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal
    government. Further, the government may use the FCA to prosecute
    Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as
    coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting
    false cost reports. When a private party brings a

qui tam

action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the
    lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or
    makes a determination whether it will intervene. When a
    defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the
    FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual
    damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil
    penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false
    claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the
    FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a
    false claim for



reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the
    term “knowingly” broadly. Though simple negligence
    will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a
    claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity
    constitutes a “knowing” submission under the FCA and,
    therefore, will qualify for liability. The Fraud Enforcement and
    Recovery Act of 2009 expanded the scope of the FCA by, among
    other things, creating liability for knowingly and improperly
    avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the
    government and broadening protections for whistleblowers. Under
    the Health Reform Law, the FCA is implicated by the knowing
    failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days
    of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding
    cost report is due, whichever is later. Further, the Health
    Reform Law expands the scope of the FCA to cover payments in
    connection with the Exchanges to be created by the Health Reform
    Law, if those payments include any federal funds.

In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have
    taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers
    who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the
    Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted
    false claims under the FCA. The Health Reform Law clarifies this
    issue with respect to the Anti-kickback Statute by providing
    that submission of claims for services or items generated in
    violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or
    fraudulent claim under the FCA. Every entity that receives at
    least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have
    written policies for all employees, contractors or agents,
    providing detailed information about false claims, false
    statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal
    laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition,
    federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false
    claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which
    we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as
    well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private
    party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted
    and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant
    state laws.

HIPAA
    Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security
    Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require
    the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for
    certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or
    received electronically. These provisions are intended to
    encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS
    has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA Administrative
    Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations
    is mandatory for our facilities. In addition, HIPAA requires
    that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. In
    January 2009, CMS published a final rule making changes to the
    formats used for certain electronic transactions and requiring
    the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and
    procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. While use of the ICD-10
    code sets is not mandatory until October 1, 2013, we will
    be modifying our payment systems and processes to prepare for
    the implementation. Implementing the ICD-10 code sets will
    require significant administrative changes, but we believe that
    the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is
    not expected to have a material, adverse effect on our business,
    financial position or results of operations. The Health Reform
    Law requires HHS to adopt standards for additional electronic
    transactions and to establish operating rules to promote
    uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic
    transaction.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to
    HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of
    individually identifiable health information and require covered
    entities, including health plans and most health care providers,
    to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards
    to protect the security of such information. ARRA broadened the
    scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In
    addition, ARRA extends the application of certain provisions of
    the security and privacy regulations to business associates
    (entities that handle identifiable health information on behalf
    of covered entities) and subjects business associates to civil
    and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. On
    July 14, 2010, HHS issued a proposed rule that would
    implement many of these ARRA provisions. If finalized, these
    changes would likely require amendments to existing agreements
    with business associates and would subject business associates
    and their subcontractors to direct liability under the HIPAA
    privacy and security regulations. We currently enforce a HIPAA
    compliance plan, which we believe complies with HIPAA privacy
    and security requirements and under which a HIPAA compliance
    group monitors our compliance. The privacy regulations and
    security regulations have and will continue to impose
    significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with
    these standards.

As required by ARRA, HHS published an interim final rule on
    August 24, 2009, that requires covered entities to report
    breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected
    individuals without unreasonable delay but



not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a
    covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to
    HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the
    media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all
    covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500
    individuals. Various state laws and regulations may also require
    us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach
    involving individually identifiable information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may
    result in civil and criminal penalties, and ARRA has
    strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, which may
    result in increased enforcement activity. Under ARRA, HHS is
    required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered
    entities and their business associates. ARRA broadens the
    applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of
    covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for
    violations resulting from willful neglect. ARRA also
    significantly increases the amount of the civil penalties, with
    penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil
    penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the
    same requirement. In addition, ARRA authorizes state attorneys
    general to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or
    damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security
    regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Our
    facilities also remain subject to any federal or state
    privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy
    regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose
    additional penalties.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory
    initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy
    and security concerns. For example, the Federal Trade Commission
    (“FTC”) issued a final rule in October 2007 requiring
    financial institutions and creditors, which arguably included
    health providers and health plans, to implement written identity
    theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate
    identity theft in connection with certain accounts. The FTC
    delayed enforcement of this rule until December 31, 2010.
    In addition, on December 18, 2010, the Red Flag Program
    Clarification Act of 2010 became law, restricting the definition
    of a “creditor.” This law may exempt many hospitals
    from complying with the rule.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA.
    This federal law requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every individual who presents to the
    hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the
    individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to
    either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer
    of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition.
    The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical
    conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to
    pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a
    hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer
    an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in
    order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
    pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary
    penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare
    program. In addition, an injured individual, the
    individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a
    financial loss as a direct result of a hospital’s violation
    of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in
    which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s
    emergency room, but present for emergency examination or
    treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
    hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions
    or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to
    certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law
    also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a
    patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned
    ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals
    admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed
    its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively
    in the future. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial
    compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate
    Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting
    corporations and other entities from employing physicians,
    practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and
    indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health
    care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of
    patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for
    medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation
    of these



restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal
    penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and
    the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These
    statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have
    seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health
    Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent
    years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention,
    changes in government personnel or other factors may lead to
    increased scrutiny of the health care industry. While we are
    currently not aware of any material investigations of the
    Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations,
    it is possible that governmental entities could initiate
    investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we
    operate and that such matters could result in significant
    penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible
    that our executives and managers could be included in
    governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants
    in private litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental
    billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We
    continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have
    developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is
    designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and
    constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation
    may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or
    industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations,
    governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
    issues, including some for which little official interpretation
    previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent
    with practices that have been common within the industry and
    that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some
    instances, government investigations that have in the past been
    conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be
    conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their
    focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement
    efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of
    Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established
    national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital
    providers that focus on specific billing practices or other
    suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes
    additional federal funding of $350 million over the next
    10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse,
    including $105 million for federal fiscal year 2011 and
    $65 million in federal fiscal year 2012. In addition,
    governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal
    intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health
    care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment
    audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and
    state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine
    health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing
    practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial
    arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment
    activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and
    collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of
    these routine health care operations and other activities that
    could be the subject of governmental investigations or
    inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and
    Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with
    physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint
    venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of
    our individual facilities have received, and other facilities
    may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to
    investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional
    investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could
    result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as
    adverse publicity.

Commencing in 1997, we became aware we were the subject of
    governmental investigations and litigation relating to our
    business practices. As part of the investigations, the United
    States intervened in a number of

qui tam

actions brought
    by private parties. The investigations related to, among other
    things, DRG coding, outpatient laboratory billing, home health
    issues, physician relations, cost report and wound care issues.
    The investigations were concluded through a series of agreements
    executed in 2000 and 2003 with the Criminal Division of the DOJ,
    the Civil Division of the DOJ, various U.S. Attorneys’
    offices, CMS, a negotiating team representing states with claims
    against us, and others. In January 2001, we entered into an
    eight-year Corporate Integrity Act (“CIA”) with the
    Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and
    Human Services, which expired January 24, 2009. We
    submitted our final report pursuant to the CIA on April 30,
    2009, and in April 2010, we received notice from the OIG that
    our final report was accepted, relieving us of future
    obligations under the CIA. If the government were to



determine that we violated or breached the CIA or other federal
    or state laws relating to Medicare, Medicaid or similar
    programs, we could be subject to substantial monetary fines,
    civil and criminal penalties

and/or

exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs and other federal and state health care programs.
    Alleged violations may be pursued by the government or through
    private

qui tam

actions. Sanctions imposed against us as
    a result of such actions could have a material, adverse effect
    on our results of operations and financial position.

Health
    Care Reform

As enacted, the Health Reform Law will change how health care
    services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded
    coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare
    program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH
    payments, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement
    is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms
    certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to
    tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality,
    and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse
    enforcement. More than 20 challenges to the Health Reform Law
    have been filed in federal courts. Some federal district courts
    have upheld the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law or
    dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held
    unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain
    health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the
    Health Reform Law void in its entirety or left the remainder of
    the Health Reform Law intact. These lawsuits are subject to
    appeal, and several are currently on appeal, including those
    that hold the law unconstitutional. It is unclear how these
    lawsuits will be resolved. Further, Congress is considering
    bills that would repeal or revise the Health Reform Law.

Expanded
    Coverage

Based on CBO and CMS estimates, by 2019, the Health Reform Law
    will expand coverage to 32 to 34 million additional
    individuals (resulting in coverage of an estimated 94% of the
    legal U.S. population). This increased coverage will occur
    through a combination of public program expansion and private
    sector health insurance and other reforms.

Medicaid
    Expansion

The primary public program coverage expansion will occur through
    changes in Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, expansion of the
    Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”). The
    most significant changes will expand the categories of
    individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permit
    individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. The
    federal government reimburses the majority of a state’s
    Medicaid expenses, and it conditions its payment on the state
    meeting certain requirements. The federal government currently
    requires that states provide coverage for only limited
    categories of low-income adults under 65 years old (e.g.,
    women who are pregnant, and the blind or disabled). In addition,
    the income level required for individuals and families to
    qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state.

The Health Reform Law materially changes the requirements for
    Medicaid eligibility. Commencing January 1, 2014, all state
    Medicaid programs are required to provide, and the federal
    government will subsidize, Medicaid coverage to virtually all
    adults under 65 years old with incomes at or under 133% of
    the federal poverty level (“FPL”). This expansion will
    create a minimum Medicaid eligibility threshold that is uniform
    across states. Further, the Health Reform Law also requires
    states to apply a “5% income disregard” to the
    Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will
    effectively be extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the
    FPL. These new eligibility requirements will expand Medicaid and
    CHIP coverage by an estimated 16 to 18 million persons
    nationwide. A disproportionately large percentage of the new
    Medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have
    relatively low income eligibility requirements.

As Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, the federal
    government provides states with “matching funds” in a
    defined percentage, known as the federal medical assistance
    percentage (“FMAP”). Beginning in 2014, states will
    receive an enhanced FMAP for the individuals enrolled in
    Medicaid pursuant to the Health Reform Law. The FMAP percentage
    is as follows: 100% for calendar years 2014 through 2016; 95%
    for 2017; 94% in 2018; 93% in 2019; and 90% in 2020 and
    thereafter.

The Health Reform Law also provides that the federal government
    will subsidize states that create non- Medicaid plans for
    residents whose incomes are greater than 133% of the FPL but do
    not exceed 200% of the FPL.



Approved state plans will be eligible to receive federal
    funding. The amount of that funding per individual will be equal
    to 95% of subsidies that would have been provided for that
    individual had he or she enrolled in a health plan offered
    through one of the Exchanges, as discussed below.

Historically, states often have attempted to reduce Medicaid
    spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid
    eligibility requirements. Effective March 23, 2010, the
    Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid
    eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the
    law for adults until January 1, 2014 and for children until
    October 1, 2019. States with budget deficits may, however,
    seek a waiver from this requirement, but only to address
    eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133%
    of the FPL.

Private
    Sector Expansion

The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a
    result of the Health Reform Law will occur through new
    requirements on health insurers, employers and individuals.
    Commencing January 1, 2014, health insurance companies will
    be prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping
    coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing conditions
    or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the
    premiums for such coverage. Effective January 1, 2011, each
    health plan must keep its annual nonmedical costs lower than 15%
    of premium revenue for the group market and lower than 20% in
    the small group and individual markets or rebate its enrollees
    the amount spent in excess of the percentage. In addition,
    effective September 23, 2010, health insurers will not be
    permitted to deny coverage to children based upon a pre-existing
    condition and must allow dependent care coverage for children up
    to 26 years old.

Larger employers will be subject to new requirements and
    incentives to provide health insurance benefits to their full
    time employees. Effective January 1, 2014, employers with
    50 or more employees that do not offer health insurance will be
    held subject to a penalty if an employee obtains coverage
    through an Exchange if the coverage is subsidized by the
    government. The employer penalties will range from $2,000 to
    $3,000 per employee, subject to certain thresholds and
    conditions.

As enacted, the Health Reform Law uses various means to induce
    individuals who do not have health insurance to obtain coverage.
    By January 1, 2014, individuals will be required to
    maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits
    or pay a tax penalty. The penalty in most cases is $95 in 2014,
    $325 in 2015, $695 in 2016, and indexed to a cost of living
    adjustment in subsequent years. The Internal Revenue Service
    (“IRS”), in consultation with HHS, is responsible for
    enforcing the tax penalty, although the Health Reform Law limits
    the availability of certain IRS enforcement mechanisms. In
    addition, for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL,
    the cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges
    will be subsidized by the federal government. Those with lower
    incomes will be eligible to receive greater subsidies. It is
    anticipated that those at the lowest income levels will have the
    majority of their premiums subsidized by the federal government,
    in some cases in excess of 95% of the premium amount.

To facilitate the purchase of health insurance by individuals
    and small employers, each state must establish an Exchange by
    January 1, 2014. Based on CBO and CMS estimates, between 29
    and 31 million individuals will obtain their health
    insurance coverage through an Exchange by 2019. Of that amount,
    an estimated 16 million will be individuals who were
    previously uninsured, and 13 to 15 million will be
    individuals who switched from their prior insurance coverage to
    a plan obtained through the Exchange. The Health Reform Law
    requires that the Exchanges be designed to make the process of
    evaluating, comparing and acquiring coverage simple for
    consumers. For example, each state’s Exchange must maintain
    an internet website through which consumers may access health
    plan ratings that are assigned by the state based on quality and
    price, view governmental health program eligibility requirements
    and calculate the actual cost of health coverage. Health
    insurers participating in an Exchange must offer a set of
    minimum benefits to be defined by HHS and may offer more
    benefits. Health insurers must offer at least two, and up to
    five, levels of plans that vary by the percentage of medical
    expenses that must be paid by the enrollee. These levels are
    referred to as platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic
    plans, with gold and silver being the two mandatory levels of
    plans. Each level of plan must require the enrollee to share the
    following percentages of medical expenses up to the
    deductible/co-payment limit: platinum, 10%; gold, 20%; silver,
    30%; bronze, 40%; and catastrophic, 100%. Health insurers may
    establish varying deductible/co-payment levels, up to the
    statutory maximum (estimated to be between $6,000 and $7,000 for
    an individual). The health insurers must



cover 100% of the amount of medical expenses in excess of the
    deductible/co-payment limit. For example, an individual making
    100% to 200% of the FPL will have co-payments and deductibles
    reduced to about one-third of the amount payable by those with
    the same plan with incomes at or above 400% of the FPL.

Public
    Program Spending

The Health Reform Law provides for Medicare, Medicaid and other
    federal health care program spending reductions between 2010 and
    2019. The CBO estimates that these will include
    $156 billion in Medicare

fee-for-service

market basket and productivity reimbursement reductions for all
    providers, the majority of which will come from hospitals; CMS
    sets this estimate at $233 billion. The CBO estimates also
    include an additional $36 billion in reductions of Medicare
    and Medicaid disproportionate share funding ($22 billion
    for Medicare and $14 billion for Medicaid). CMS estimates
    include an additional $64 billion in reductions of Medicare
    and Medicaid disproportionate share funding, with
    $50 billion of the reductions coming from Medicare.

Payments
    for Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers

Inpatient Market Basket and Productivity
    Adjustment

.

Under the Medicare program,
    hospitals receive reimbursement under a PPS for general, acute
    care hospital inpatient services. CMS establishes fixed PPS
    payment amounts per inpatient discharge based on the
    patient’s assigned MS-DRG. These MS-DRG rates are updated
    each federal fiscal year, which begins October 1, using a
    market basket index that takes into account inflation
    experienced by hospitals and other entities outside the health
    care industry in purchasing goods and services.

The Health Reform Law provides for three types of annual
    reductions in the market basket. The first is a general
    reduction of a specified percentage each federal fiscal year
    starting in 2010 and extending through 2019. These reductions
    are as follows: federal fiscal year 2010, 0.25% for discharges
    occurring on or after April 1, 2010; 2011 (0.25%); 2012
    (0.1%); 2013 (0.1%); 2014 (0.3%); 2015 (0.2%); 2016 (0.2%); 2017
    (0.75%); 2018 (0.75%); and 2019 (0.75%).

The second type of reduction to the market basket is a
    “productivity adjustment” that will be implemented by
    HHS beginning in federal fiscal year 2012. The amount of that
    reduction will be the projected nationwide productivity gains
    over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection,
    HHS will use the BLS

10-year

moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity
    (the BLS data is typically a few years old). The Health Reform
    Law does not contain guidelines for HHS to use in projecting the
    productivity figure. Based upon the latest available data,
    federal fiscal year 2012 market basket reductions resulting from
    this productivity adjustment are likely to range from 1% to 1.4%.

The third type of reduction is in connection with the
    value-based purchasing program discussed in more detail below.
    Beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, CMS will reduce the
    inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by the
    following: 1% for 2013; 1.25% for 2014; 1.5% for 2015; 1.75% for
    2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. For each federal
    fiscal year, the total amount collected from these reductions
    will be pooled and used to fund payments to hospitals that
    satisfy certain quality metrics. While some or all of these
    reductions may be recovered if a hospital satisfies these
    quality metrics, the recovery amounts may be delayed.

If the aggregate of the three market basket reductions described
    above is more than the annual market basket adjustments made to
    account for inflation, there will be a reduction in the MS-DRG
    rates paid to hospitals. For example, for the federal fiscal
    year 2011 hospital inpatient PPS, the market basket increase to
    account for inflation is 2.6% and the aggregate reduction due to
    the Health Reform Law and the documentation and coding
    adjustment is 3.15%. Thus, the rates paid to a hospital for
    inpatient services in federal fiscal year 2011 will be 0.55%
    less than rates paid for the same services in the prior year.

Quality-Based Payment Adjustments and Reductions for
    Inpatient Services

.

The Health Reform Law
    establishes or expands three provisions to promote value-based
    purchasing and to link payments to quality and efficiency.
    First, in federal fiscal year 2013, HHS is directed to implement
    a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital
    services. This program will reward hospitals that meet certain
    quality performance standards established by HHS. The Health
    Reform Law provides HHS considerable discretion over the
    value-based purchasing program. For example, HHS will determine
    the quality performance measures, the standards hospitals



must achieve in order to meet the quality performance measures,
    and the methodology for calculating payments to hospitals that
    meet the required quality threshold. HHS will also determine how
    much money each hospital will receive from the pool of dollars
    created by the reductions related to the value-based purchasing
    program as described above. Because the Health Reform Law
    provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that
    meet or exceed the quality performance standards set by HHS will
    receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing
    program than they would have otherwise. On the other hand,
    hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance
    will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. On
    January 7, 2011, CMS issued a proposed rule for the
    value-based purchasing program that would use 17 clinical
    process of care measures and eight dimensions of a
    patient’s experience of care using the HCAHPS survey to
    determine incentive payments for federal fiscal year 2013. As
    proposed, the incentive payments would be calculated based on a
    combination of measures of hospitals’ achievement of the
    performance standards and their improvement in meeting the
    performance standards compared to prior periods. To determine
    payments in federal fiscal year 2013, the baseline performance
    period (measurement standard) as proposed would be July 1,
    2009 through March 31, 2010. To determine whether hospitals
    meet performance standards, CMS would compare each
    hospital’s performance in the period July 1, 2011
    through March 31, 2012 to its performance in the baseline
    performance period. CMS has not yet proposed specific threshold
    values for the performance standards. CMS also proposes to add
    three outcome measures for federal fiscal year 2014, for which
    the performance period would be July 1, 2011 through
    December 31, 2012 and the baseline performance period would
    be July 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009.

Second, beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, inpatient
    payments will be reduced if a hospital experiences
    “excessive readmissions” within a time period
    specified by HHS from the date of discharge for heart attack,
    heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions designated by HHS.
    Hospitals with what HHS defines as “excessive
    readmissions” for these conditions will receive reduced
    payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges
    relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission
    standard. Each hospital’s performance will be publicly
    reported by HHS. HHS has the discretion to determine what
    “excessive readmissions” means and other terms and
    conditions of this program.

Third, reimbursement will be reduced based on a facility’s
    HAC rates. An HAC is a condition that is acquired by a patient
    while admitted as an inpatient in a hospital, such as a surgical
    site infection. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25%
    of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in
    the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total
    inpatient operating Medicare payments. In addition, effective
    July 1, 2011, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of
    federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers
    for medical services provided to treat HACs.

Outpatient Market Basket and Productivity
    Adjustment

.

Hospital outpatient services paid
    under PPS are classified into APCs. The APC payment rates are
    updated each calendar year based on the market basket. The first
    two market basket changes outlined above — the general
    reduction and the productivity adjustment — apply to
    outpatient services as well as inpatient services, although
    these are applied on a calendar year basis. The percentage
    changes specified in the Health Reform Law summarized above as
    the general reduction for inpatients — e.g., 0.2% in
    2015 — are the same for outpatients.

Medicare and Medicaid DSH Payments

.

The
    Medicare DSH program provides for additional payments to
    hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of low-income
    patients. Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal
    fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments will be reduced to 25%
    of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The
    remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under
    Medicare DSH will be effectively pooled, and this pool will be
    reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions
    in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years
    of age. In other words, the greater the level of coverage for
    the uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool
    will be reduced. Each hospital will then be paid, out of the
    reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its
    level of uncompensated care.

It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Medicare DSH
    reductions, and CBO and CMS estimates differ by
    $38 billion. The Health Reform Law does not mandate what
    data source HHS must use to determine the reduction, if any, in
    the uninsured population nationally. In addition, the Health
    Reform Law does not contain a definition of “uncompensated
    care.” As a result, it is unclear how a hospital’s
    share of the Medicare DSH payment pool will be calculated. CMS
    could use the definition of “uncompensated care” used
    in connection with hospital cost reports.



However, in July 2009, CMS proposed material revisions to the
    definition of “uncompensated care” used for cost
    report purposes. Those revisions would exclude certain
    significant costs that had historically been covered, such as
    unreimbursed costs of Medicaid services. CMS has not issued a
    final rule, and the Health Reform Law does not require HHS to
    use this definition, even if finalized, for DSH purposes. How
    CMS ultimately defines “uncompensated care” for
    purposes of these DSH funding provisions could have a material
    effect on a hospital’s Medicare DSH reimbursements.

In addition to Medicare DSH funding, hospitals that provide care
    to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may
    receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government
    distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a
    statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding
    among qualifying hospitals. Although federal Medicaid law
    defines some level of hospitals that must receive Medicaid DSH
    funding, states have broad discretion to define additional
    hospitals that also may qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and
    the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law will reduce
    funding for the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal
    years 2014 through 2020 by the following amounts: 2014
    ($500 million); 2015 ($600 million); 2016
    ($600 million); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018
    ($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020
    ($4 billion). How such cuts are allocated among the states,
    and how the states allocate these cuts among providers, have yet
    to be determined.

ACOs

.

The Health Reform Law requires
    HHS to establish a Medicare Shared Savings Program that promotes
    accountability and coordination of care through the creation of
    ACOs. Beginning no later than January 1, 2012, the program
    will allow providers (including hospitals), physicians and other
    designated professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and
    voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and
    redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and
    efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to
    produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational
    efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards
    established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the
    amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant
    discretion to determine key elements of the program, including
    what steps providers must take to be considered an ACO, how to
    decide if Medicare program savings have occurred, and what
    portion of such savings will be paid to ACOs. In addition, HHS
    will determine to what degree hospitals, physicians and other
    eligible participants will be able to form and operate an ACO
    without violating certain existing laws, including the Civil
    Monetary Penalty Law, the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark
    Law. However, the Health Reform Law does not authorize HHS to
    waive other laws that may impact the ability of hospitals and
    other eligible participants to participate in ACOs, such as
    antitrust laws.

Bundled Payment Pilot Programs

.

The
    Health Reform Law requires HHS to establish a five-year,
    voluntary national bundled payment pilot program for Medicare
    services beginning no later than January 1, 2013. Under the
    program, providers would agree to receive one payment for
    services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical
    conditions or episodes of care. HHS will have the discretion to
    determine how the program will function. For example, HHS will
    determine what medical conditions will be included in the
    program and the amount of the payment for each condition. In
    addition, the Health Reform Law provides for a five-year bundled
    payment pilot program for Medicaid services to begin
    January 1, 2012. HHS will select up to eight states to
    participate based on the potential to lower costs under the
    Medicaid program while improving care. State programs may target
    particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or
    geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs
    will provide one payment for both hospital and physician
    services provided to Medicaid patients for certain episodes of
    inpatient care. For both pilot programs, HHS will determine the
    relationship between the programs and restrictions in certain
    existing laws, including the Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the
    Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark Law and the HIPAA privacy,
    security and transaction standard requirements. However, the
    Health Reform Law does not authorize HHS to waive other laws
    that may impact the ability of hospitals and other eligible
    participants to participate in the pilot programs, such as
    antitrust laws.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

.

The Health
    Reform Law reduces reimbursement for ASCs through a productivity
    adjustment to the market basket similar to the productivity
    adjustment for inpatient and outpatient hospital services,
    beginning in federal fiscal year 2011.

Medicare Managed Care (Medicare Advantage or
    “MA”)

.

Under the MA program, the
    federal government contracts with private health plans to
    provide inpatient and outpatient benefits to beneficiaries who
    enroll in such plans. Nationally, approximately 22% of Medicare
    beneficiaries have elected to enroll in MA plans. Effective in
    2014, the Health Reform Law requires MA plans to keep annual
    administrative costs lower than 15% of annual



premium revenue. The Health Reform Law reduces, over a three
    year period, premium payments to the MA plans such that
    CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments are, on
    average, equal to traditional Medicare. In addition, the Health
    Reform Law implements fee payment adjustments based on service
    benchmarks and quality ratings. As a result of these changes,
    payments to MA plans are estimated to be reduced by $138 to
    $145 billion between 2010 and 2019. These reductions to MA
    plan premium payments may cause some plans to raise premiums or
    limit benefits, which in turn might cause some Medicare
    beneficiaries to terminate their MA coverage and enroll in
    traditional Medicare.

Specialty
    Hospital Limitations

Over the last decade, we have faced significant competition from
    hospitals that have physician ownership. The Health Reform Law
    prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing
    for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a
    result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new
    physician-owned hospitals after December 31, 2010. While
    the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does
    not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of
    physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to
    expand services.

Program
    Integrity and Fraud and Abuse

The Health Reform Law makes several significant changes to
    health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional
    enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation
    between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of
    information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties
    for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law:
    (1) provides $350 million in increased federal funding
    over the next 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste
    and abuse; (2) expands the scope of the RAC program to
    include MA plans and Medicaid; (3) authorizes HHS, in
    consultation with the OIG, to suspend Medicare and Medicaid
    payments to a provider of services or a supplier “pending
    an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud;”
    (4) provides Medicare contractors with additional
    flexibility to conduct random prepayment reviews; and
    (5) tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made
    by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to
    include failure to timely repay identified overpayments.

Impact of
    Health Reform Law on the Company

The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health
    Reform Law may result in a material increase in the number of
    patients using our facilities who have either private or public
    program coverage. In addition, a disproportionately large
    percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in
    states that currently have relatively low income eligibility
    requirements. Two such states are Texas and Florida, where about
    one-half of the Company’s licensed beds are located. We
    also have a significant presence in other relatively low income
    eligibility states, including Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana,
    Missouri, Oklahoma and Virginia. Further, the Health Reform Law
    provides for a value-based purchasing program, the establishment
    of ACOs and bundled payment pilot programs, which will create
    possible sources of additional revenue.

However, it is difficult to predict the size of the potential
    revenue gains to the Company as a result of these elements of
    the Health Reform Law, because of uncertainty surrounding a
    number of material factors, including the following:

•

how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage
    as a result of the Health Reform Law (while the CBO estimates
    32 million, CMS estimates almost 34 million; both
    agencies made a number of assumptions to derive that figure,
    including how many individuals will ignore substantial subsidies
    and decide to pay the penalty rather than obtain health
    insurance and what percentage of people in the future will meet
    the new Medicaid income eligibility requirements);

•

what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered
    under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered
    by private health insurers;

•

the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants
    in managed care programs;

•

the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace
    of different types of coverage expansion;



•

the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient
    hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously
    uninsured individuals;

•

the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered
    individuals, including those covered through the newly created
    Exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid
    program under contracts with the state;

•

the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program
    for newly covered individuals;

•

how the value-based purchasing and other quality programs will
    be implemented;

•

the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the
    high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those
    kinds of products have traditionally sought to pay lower rates
    to hospitals;

•

whether the net effect of the Health Reform Law, including the
    prohibition on excluding individuals based on pre-existing
    conditions, the requirement to keep medical costs at or above a
    specified minimum percentage of premium revenue, other health
    insurance reforms and the annual fee applied to all health
    insurers, will be to put pressure on the bottom line of health
    insurers, which in turn might cause them to seek to reduce
    payments to hospitals with respect to both newly insured
    individuals and their existing business; and

•

the possibility that implementation of the provisions expanding
    health insurance coverage or the entire Health Reform Law will
    be delayed due to court challenges or revised or eliminated as a
    result of court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the
    law. More than 20 challenges to the Health Reform Law have been
    filed in federal courts. Some federal district courts have
    upheld the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law or
    dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held
    unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain
    health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the
    entire Health Reform Law void in its entirety or left the
    remainder of the Health Reform Law intact. These lawsuits are
    subject to appeal, and several are currently on appeal,
    including those that hold the law unconstitutional.

On the other hand, the Health Reform Law provides for
    significant reductions in the growth of Medicare spending,
    reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the
    establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality
    and integration. Since 40.7% of our revenues in 2010 were from
    Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these programs may
    significantly impact the Company and could offset any positive
    effects of the Health Reform Law. It is difficult to predict the
    size of the revenue reductions to Medicare and Medicaid
    spending, because of uncertainty regarding a number of material
    factors, including the following:

•

the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from
    Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are
    implemented;

•

whether reductions required by the Health Reform Law will be
    changed by statute or by judicial decision prior to becoming
    effective;

•

the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity
    adjustment to the market basket beginning in 2012 payment years;

•

the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions that will be made,
    commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;

•

the allocation to our hospitals of the Medicaid DSH reductions,
    commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;

•

what the losses in revenues will be, if any, from the Health
    Reform Law’s quality initiatives;

•

how successful ACOs, in which we anticipate participating, will
    be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will
    decrease reimbursement;

•

the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare
    reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments
    or coordination of care programs;



•

whether the Company’s revenues from upper payment limit
    (“UPL”) programs will be adversely affected, because
    there may be fewer indigent, non-Medicaid patients for whom the
    Company provides services pursuant to UPL programs; and

•

reductions to Medicare payments CMS may impose for
    “excessive readmissions.”

Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict
    the net effect on the Company of the expected increases in
    insured individuals using our facilities, the reductions in
    Medicare spending and reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH
    Funding, and numerous other provisions in the Health Reform Law
    that may affect the Company. Further, it is unclear how efforts
    to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and federal lawsuits
    challenging its constitutionality will be resolved or what the
    impact would be of any resulting changes to the law.

General
    Economic and Demographic Factors

The United States economy has weakened significantly in recent
    years. Depressed consumer spending and higher unemployment rates
    continue to pressure many industries. During economic downturns,
    governmental entities often experience budget deficits as a
    result of increased costs and lower than expected tax
    collections. These budget deficits have forced federal, state
    and local government entities to decrease spending for health
    and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for
    our hospitals. Other risks we face from general economic
    weakness include potential declines in the population covered
    under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or
    cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures,
    potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured
    populations and further difficulties in our collecting patient
    co-payment and deductible receivables. The Health Reform Law
    seeks to decrease over time the number of uninsured individuals,
    by among other things requiring employers to offer, and
    individuals to carry, health insurance or be subject to
    penalties. However, it is difficult to predict the full impact
    of the Health Reform Law due to the law’s complexity, lack
    of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual
    and potentially delayed implementation, pending court
    challenges, and possible amendment or repeal.

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United
    States economy. The federal deficit, the growing magnitude of
    Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States
    population will continue to place pressure on federal health
    care programs.

Compliance
    Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that
    is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and
    industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise
    awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to
    emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and
    regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we
    provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees
    and encourage all employees to report any violations to their
    supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free
    telephone ethics line. The Health Reform Law requires providers
    to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be
    established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a
    condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs,
    and we may have to modify our compliance programs to comply with
    these new criteria.

Antitrust
    Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust
    laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
    anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted
    refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination,
    tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other
    practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on
    competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can
    result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil
    penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
    currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe
    we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but
    courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in
    the future that could adversely affect our operations.



Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and
    ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment. We do not believe that we will be required to
    expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws
    and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to
    claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of
    business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence
    self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
    $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has
    obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally
    above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We
    also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
    commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by
    our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for
    directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we
    believe are adequate. The directors and officers liability
    coverage includes a $25 million corporate deductible for
    the period prior to the Recapitalization and a $1 million
    corporate deductible subsequent to the Recapitalization. In
    addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our
    directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property
    coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of
    the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per
    claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood
    and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees
    and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    194,000 employees, including approximately
    48,000 part-time employees. References herein to
    “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We
    are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate
    wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating
    to employment. At December 31, 2010, employees at 32 of our
    hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is
    possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We
    consider our employee relations to be good and have not
    experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely
    affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals,
    like most hospitals, have experienced labor costs rising faster
    than the general inflation rate. In some markets, nurse and
    medical support personnel availability has become a significant
    operating issue to health care providers. To address this
    challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve
    retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, who generally
    are not employees of our hospitals. However, some physicians
    provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which
    generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the
    duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
    maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation
    for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be
    accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the
    hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
    board of the hospital, in accordance with established
    credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff.
    Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve
    on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their
    affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to
    recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or
    to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a
    result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the
    available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in
    each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed
    changes in federal labor laws, including the Employee Free
    Choice Act, could increase the likelihood of employee
    unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of
    our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase
    materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could
    adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory
    nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated
    nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs,
    and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to
    limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors
    were to occur, our business, financial position, results of
    operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially,
    adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not
    presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also
    constrain our business and operations.

Our
    substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise
    additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to
    react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to
    interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and
    prevent us from meeting our obligations.

We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2010, our total
    indebtedness was $28.225 billion. As of December 31,
    2010, we had availability of $1.189 billion under our
    senior secured revolving credit facility and $125 million
    under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving
    effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. Our
    high degree of leverage could have important consequences,
    including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in
    general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse
    changes in government regulations;

•

requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to
    be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our
    indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash
    flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future
    business opportunities;

•

exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain
    of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;

•

limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing
    us to make nonstrategic divestitures;

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working
    capital, capital expenditures, product or service line
    development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general
    corporate or other purposes; and

•

limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and
    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our
    competitors who are less highly leveraged.

We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional
    indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions
    contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the
    indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness
    is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we
    now face could intensify.

We may
    not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our
    indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness
    on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced
    to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our
    indebtedness, which may not be successful.

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our
    debt obligations depends on our financial condition and
    operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic
    and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business
    and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we
    will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities
    sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
    and interest on our indebtedness.

In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries.
    Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the
    generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to
    make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or
    otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be
    permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments
    in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct
    legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and
    contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash
    from our subsidiaries.

We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding
    indebtedness with longer-maturity debt at a higher interest
    rate. In February, April and August of 2009 and in March of
    2010, for example, we issued $310 million in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    second lien notes due 2017, $1.500 billion in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    first lien notes due 2019, $1.250 billion in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    first lien notes due 2020 and $1.400 billion in aggregate
    principal amount of


/


%
    first lien notes due 2020, respectively. The net proceeds of
    those offerings were used to prepay term loans under our cash
    flow credit facility, which currently bears interest at a lower
    floating rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on
    favorable terms, or at all, is



directly affected by the current global economic and financial
    conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured
    indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better
    pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends
    in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on
    the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on
    economic and market conditions and other factors.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund
    our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our
    indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments
    and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional
    capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative
    measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our
    scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and
    available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service
    obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and
    might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to
    meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able
    to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the
    dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service
    obligations then due.

Our debt
    agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in
    operating our business.

Our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures
    governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that
    limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions.
    These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’
    ability to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of
    our capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments;

•

sell or transfer assets;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of our assets; and

•

enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for
    as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based
    revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving
    credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain
    period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default
    has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our
    depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a
    blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to
    prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and
    to cash collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.

Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to
    satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to
    meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our
    control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet
    those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in
    a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the
    asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an
    event of default under the senior secured credit facilities, the
    lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts
    outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be
    immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to
    extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts,
    the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could
    proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such
    indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our
    assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that
    collateral (other than certain European collateral securing our
    senior secured European term loan facility) is also pledged as
    collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders
    under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the
    repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be
    sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities,
    the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.

Our
    hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and
    health care providers.

The health care business is highly competitive, and competition
    among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has
    intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the
    local communities we serve provide services similar to those
    offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its
    Hospital Compare website performance data related to quality
    measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals
    submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal
    law provides for the future expansion of the number of



quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality
    measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have
    an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient
    volumes. Further, the Health Reform Law requires all hospitals
    to annually establish, update and make public a list of the
    hospital’s standard charges for items and services. If any
    of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower
    than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient
    satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than
    our competitors, our patient volumes could decline.

In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals,
    surgery centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the
    geographic areas in which we operate has increased
    significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a
    highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that
    compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or
    not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable
    contributions

and/or

tax
    revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on
    a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals face increasing competition
    from specialty hospitals, some of which are physician-owned, and
    from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers
    for market share in high margin services and for quality
    physicians and personnel. If ambulatory surgery centers are
    better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals,
    our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we
    may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use
    our ambulatory surgery centers. In states that do not require a
    CON for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care
    facilities or services, competition in the form of new services,
    facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Further, if
    our competitors are better able to attract patients, recruit
    physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care
    contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ambulatory
    surgery centers, we may experience an overall decline in patient
    volume. See Item 1, “Business —
    Competition.”

    growth of uninsured and patient due accounts and a deterioration
    in the collectibility of these accounts could adversely affect
    our results of operations.

The primary collection risks of our accounts receivable relate
    to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which
    the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by
    the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly
    from patients.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical write-offs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal and state governmental and private employer
    health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient
    admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31,
    2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 93% of the $4.249 billion patient due
    accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for
    doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care
    increased from $7.009 billion for 2008 to
    $8.362 billion for 2009 and to $9.626 billion for 2010.

A continuation of the trends that have resulted in an increasing
    proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured
    accounts and a deterioration in the collectibility of these
    accounts will adversely affect our collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations. Prior to the
    Health Reform Law being fully implemented, our facilities may
    experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity
    care as a result of a number of factors, including the economic
    downturn and increase in unemployment. The Health Reform Law
    seeks to decrease, over time, the number of uninsured
    individuals. As enacted, the Health Reform Law will, effective
    January 1, 2014, expand Medicaid and incentivize employers
    to offer, and require individuals to carry, health insurance or
    be subject to penalties. More than 20 challenges to the Health
    Reform Law have been filed in federal courts. Some federal
    courts have upheld the constitutionality of the Health Reform
    Law or dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held
    unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain
    health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the
    Health Reform Law void in its entirety or left the remainder of
    the law intact. These lawsuits are subject to appeal, and
    several are currently on appeal, including those that hold the
    law unconstitutional. It is difficult to predict the full impact
    of the Health Reform Law due to the law’s complexity, lack
    of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual
    and potentially delayed implementation, pending court challenges
    and possible amendment or repeal, as well as our inability to
    foresee how individuals and businesses will respond to the
    choices afforded them by the law. In addition, even after
    implementation of the Health Reform Law, we may continue to
    experience bad debts and have to provide uninsured discounts and
    charity care for



undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in a health
    insurance exchange or government health care programs and
    certain others who may not have insurance coverage.

Changes
    in government health care programs may reduce our
    revenues.

A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from
    government health care programs, principally Medicare and
    Medicaid. Specifically, we derived approximately 41% of our
    revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2010.
    Changes in government health care programs may reduce the
    reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business
    and results of operations.

In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have
    resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in
    levels of payments to health care providers for certain services
    under the Medicare program. For example, CMS completed a
    two-year transition to full implementation of the MS-DRG system,
    which represents a refinement to the existing diagnosis-related
    group system. Future realignments in the MS-DRG system could
    impact the margins we receive for certain services. Further, the
    Health Reform Law provides for material reductions in the growth
    of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare
    market basket updates and Medicare DSH funding. Medicare
    payments in federal fiscal year 2011 for inpatient hospital
    services are expected to be slightly lower than payments for the
    same services in federal fiscal year 2010, because of reductions
    resulting from the Health Reform Law and the MS-DRG
    implementation.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since
    the Medicaid program is often a state’s largest program,
    some states can be expected to enact or consider enacting
    legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The
    current economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures
    on many states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted, and
    likely will continue to result, in decreased spending, or
    decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the CHIP in
    many states. The Health Reform Law provides for material
    reductions to Medicaid DSH funding. Further, many states have
    also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce
    coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs

and/or

impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand
    the states’ Medicaid systems. Effective March 23,
    2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain
    Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the
    enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and
    for children until October 1, 2019. However, states with
    budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to
    address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more
    than 133% of the federal poverty level. The Health Reform Law
    also provides for significant expansions to the Medicaid
    program, but these changes are not required until 2014. In
    addition, the Health Reform Law will result in increased state
    legislative and regulatory changes in order for states to comply
    with new federal mandates, such as the requirement to establish
    Exchanges, and to participate in grants and other incentive
    opportunities.

In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or
    portions of the MS-DRG system to determine payment rates, which
    may result in decreased reimbursement from some commercial
    third-party payers. Other changes to government health care
    programs may negatively impact payments from commercial
    third-party payers.

Current or future health care reform efforts, changes in laws or
    regulations regarding government health care programs, other
    changes in the administration of government health care programs
    and changes to commercial third-party payers in response to
    health care reform and other changes to government health care
    programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial
    position and results of operations.

We are
    unable to predict the impact of the Health Reform Law, which
    represents a significant change to the health care
    industry.

As enacted, the Health Reform Law will change how health care
    services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed through expanded
    coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare
    program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH
    payments and the establishment of programs where reimbursement
    is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms
    certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to
    tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality,
    and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse
    enforcement. The expansion of health insurance coverage under
    the Health Reform Law may result in a material increase in the
    number of patients using our facilities who have either private
    or public program coverage. In addition, a disproportionately
    large percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in



states that currently have relatively low income eligibility
    requirements. Two such states are Texas and Florida, where about
    one-half of the Company’s licensed beds are located. The
    Company also has a significant presence in other relatively low
    income eligibility states, including Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana,
    Missouri, Oklahoma and Virginia. Further, the Health Reform Law
    provides for a value-based purchasing program, the establishment
    of ACOs and bundled payment pilot programs, which will create
    possible sources of additional revenue.

However, it is difficult to predict the size of the potential
    revenue gains to the Company as a result of these elements of
    the Health Reform Law, because of uncertainty surrounding a
    number of material factors, including the following:

•

how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage
    as a result of the Health Reform Law (while the CBO estimates
    32 million, CMS estimates almost 34 million; both
    agencies made a number of assumptions to derive that figure,
    including how many individuals will ignore substantial subsidies
    and decide to pay the penalty rather than obtain health
    insurance and what percentage of people in the future will meet
    the new Medicaid income eligibility requirements);

•

what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered
    under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered
    by private health insurers;

•

the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants
    in managed care programs;

•

the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace
    of different types of coverage expansion;

•

the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient
    hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously
    uninsured individuals;

•

the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered
    individuals, including those covered through the newly created
    Exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid
    program under contracts with the state;

•

the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program
    for newly covered individuals;

•

how the value-based purchasing and other quality programs will
    be implemented;

•

the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the
    high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those
    kinds of products have traditionally sought to pay lower rates
    to hospitals;

•

whether the net effect of the Health Reform Law, including the
    prohibition on excluding individuals based on pre-existing
    conditions, the requirement to keep medical costs at or above a
    specified minimum percentage of premium revenue, other health
    insurance reforms and the annual fee applied to all health
    insurers, will be to put pressure on the bottom line of health
    insurers, which in turn might cause them to seek to reduce
    payments to hospitals with respect to both newly insured
    individuals and their existing business; and

•

the possibility that implementation of the provisions expanding
    health insurance coverage or the entire Health Reform Law will
    be delayed due to court challenges or revised or eliminated as a
    result of court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the
    law. More than 20 challenges to the Health Reform Law have been
    filed in federal courts. Some federal district courts have
    upheld the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law or
    dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held
    unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain
    health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the
    Health Reform Law void in its entirety or left the remainder of
    the law intact. These lawsuits are subject to appeal, and
    several are currently on appeal, including those that hold the
    law unconstitutional.

On the other hand, the Health Reform Law provides for
    significant reductions in the growth of Medicare spending,
    reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the
    establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality
    and integration. Since 40.7% of our revenues in 2010 were from
    Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these programs may
    significantly impact the Company and could offset any positive
    effects of the Health Reform Law. It is difficult to predict the
    size of the revenue reductions to Medicare and Medicaid
    spending, because of uncertainty regarding a number of material
    factors, including the following:

•

the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from
    Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are
    implemented;



•

whether reductions required by the Health Reform Law will be
    changed by statute or by judicial decision prior to becoming
    effective;

•

the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity
    adjustment to the market basket beginning in 2012 payment years;

•

the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions that will be made,
    commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;

•

the allocation to our hospitals of the Medicaid DSH reductions,
    commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;

•

what the losses in revenues will be, if any, from the Health
    Reform Law’s quality initiatives;

•

how successful ACOs, in which we anticipate participating, will
    be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will
    decrease reimbursement;

•

the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare
    reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments
    or coordination of care programs;

•

whether the Company’s revenues from UPL programs will be
    adversely affected, because there may be fewer indigent,
    non-Medicaid patients for whom the Company provides services
    pursuant to UPL programs; and

•

reductions to Medicare payments CMS may impose for
    “excessive readmissions.”

Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict
    the net effect on the Company of the expected increases in
    insured individuals using our facilities, the reductions in
    Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH
    funding, and numerous other provisions in the Health Reform Law
    that may affect the Company. Further, it is unclear how efforts
    to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and federal lawsuits
    challenging its constitutionality will be resolved or what the
    impact would be of any resulting changes to the law.

If we are
    unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with
    nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, our revenues
    may be reduced.

Our ability to obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment
    payers, including health maintenance organizations, preferred
    provider organizations and other managed care plans
    significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our
    facilities. Revenues derived from these entities and other
    insurers accounted for 53.7% and 53.4% of our revenues for 2010
    and 2009, respectively. Nongovernment payers, including managed
    care payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and
    the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends
    to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. As
    various provisions of the Health Reform Law are implemented,
    including the establishment of the Exchanges, nongovernment
    payers increasingly may demand reduced fees. Our future success
    will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our
    managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts
    on terms favorable to us. Other health care providers may impact
    our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate
    increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and
    conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate
    exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise
    restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with
    us. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased
    obligations on managed care payers and other payers imposed by
    the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate
    reimbursement increases. If we are unable to retain and
    negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans or
    experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received
    from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced.

Our
    performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality
    physicians.

The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and
    quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our
    hospitals, the admitting practices of those physicians and
    maintaining good relations with those physicians. Although we
    employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of
    the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets
    we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other
    hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may
    terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. If
    we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or
    technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that
    meet the needs of



those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged
    from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may
    decrease and our operating performance may decline.

Our
    hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase
    labor costs and reduce profitability.

Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and
    experience of our management and medical support personnel, such
    as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our
    physicians. We compete with other health care providers in
    recruiting and retaining qualified management and support
    personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our
    hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care
    professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and
    other medical support personnel has been a significant operating
    issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue
    to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and
    other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive
    temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs
    could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of
    semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in
    which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor
    laws, including the Employee Free Choice Act, could increase the
    likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a
    significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is
    possible our labor costs could increase materially. When
    negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions,
    whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there
    is the possibility that strikes could occur during the
    negotiation process, and our continued operation during any
    strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states
    in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios
    or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in
    place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly
    affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we
    are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required
    ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise
    rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant
    percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective
    payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is
    constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified
    management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to
    control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on
    our results of operations.

If we
    fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations,
    we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant
    changes to our operations.

The health care industry is required to comply with extensive
    and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local
    government levels relating to, among other things:

•

billing and coding for services and properly handling
    overpayments;

•

relationships with physicians and other referral sources;

•

necessity and adequacy of medical care;

•

quality of medical equipment and services;

•

qualifications of medical and support personnel;

•

confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and
    security issues associated with health-related and personal
    information and medical records;

•

screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have
    emergency medical conditions;

•

licensure and certification;

•

hospital rate or budget review;

•

preparing and filing of cost reports;

•

operating policies and procedures;

•

activities regarding competitors; and

•

addition of facilities and services.



Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the
    federal physician self-referral law (commonly called the Stark
    Law), the federal FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety
    of financial relationships with physicians and others who either
    refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals and
    other health care facilities, and these laws govern those
    relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that
    outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the
    Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the
    applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements,
    including joint ventures and financial relationships with
    physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities
    to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor
    protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean
    the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute
    but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we
    cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor
    will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute.
    Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be
    brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which
    requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse
    laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.

Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their
    immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by
    meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships
    to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations
    implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we
    cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully
    with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to
    meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of
    the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.

Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark
    Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found
    to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the
    government or by a private person under a

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suit. See Item 1,
    “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

If we fail to comply with the Anti-kickback Statute, the Stark
    Law, the FCA or other applicable laws and regulations, we could
    be subjected to liabilities, including civil penalties
    (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more
    facilities), exclusion of one or more facilities from
    participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and
    state health care programs and, for violations of certain laws
    and regulations, criminal penalties.

We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or
    judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the
    future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or
    amendment to, these laws and regulations could subject our
    current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or
    illegality or could require us to make changes in our
    facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure
    programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have
    violated these laws, or the public announcement that we are
    being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could
    have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business
    reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other
    legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be
    adopted that adversely affect our business.

We have
    been and could become the subject of governmental
    investigations, claims and litigation.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Further, under the FCA, private
    parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit
    false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments
    from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state
    whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our
    individual facilities have received, and other facilities may
    receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to
    investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on
    whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or
    investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution
    could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position,
    results of operations and liquidity.

Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the Medicare
    Administrative Contractors, fiscal intermediaries and carriers,
    as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct
    audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct
    similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits
    and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in
    such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be
    considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a
    material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations and liquidity.



As required by statute, CMS has implemented the RAC program on a
    nationwide basis. Under the program, CMS contracts with RACs on
    a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to
    detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service
    Medicare program. The Health Reform Law expands the RAC
    program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and to
    include Medicaid claims. In addition, CMS employs MICs to
    perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify
    overpayments. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding
    for the MIC program for federal fiscal year 2011 and later
    years. In addition to RACs and MICs, the state Medicaid agencies
    and other contractors have increased their review activities.

Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws,
    regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the
    findings, our business, our financial position and our results
    of operations could be negatively impacted.

Controls
    designed to reduce inpatient services may reduce our
    revenues.

Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid,
    managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to
    reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as
    “utilization review,” have affected and are expected
    to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails
    the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient
    by health plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay
    and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by
    payer-required preadmission authorization and utilization review
    and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative
    health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients.
    Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to
    continue. For example, the Health Reform Law potentially expands
    the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by
    eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Although we are
    unable to predict the effect these changes will have on our
    operations, significant limits on the scope of services
    reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a
    material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and
    results of operations.

Our
    overall business results may suffer from the economic
    downturn.

During periods of high unemployment, governmental entities often
    experience budget deficits as a result of increased costs and
    lower than expected tax collections. These budget deficits at
    federal, state and local government entities have decreased, and
    may continue to decrease, spending for health and human service
    programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs,
    which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals.
    Other risks we face during periods of high unemployment include
    potential declines in the population covered under managed care
    agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and
    non-emergency health care procedures, potential increases in the
    uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties
    in our collecting patient co-payment and deductible receivables.

The
    industry trend towards value-based purchasing may negatively
    impact our revenues.

There is a trend in the health care industry towards value-based
    purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing
    programs include both public reporting of quality data and
    preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of
    care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including
    Medicare and Medicaid currently require hospitals to report
    certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In
    addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to
    certain preventable adverse events (also called “never
    events”). Many large commercial payers currently require
    hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers
    do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse
    events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which
    we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or
    expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.

Effective July 1, 2011, the Health Reform Law will prohibit
    the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse
    providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs.
    Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with
    the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year
    will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating
    Medicare payments. Hospitals with excessive readmissions for



conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for
    all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the
    conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.

The Health Reform Law also requires HHS to implement a
    value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services.
    The Health Reform Law requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital
    payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in
    federal fiscal year 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal
    year up to 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years.
    HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund
    payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality
    performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the
    amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality
    performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars
    created by these payment reductions. As proposed by CMS, the
    value-based purchasing program will initially calculate
    incentive payments based on hospitals’ achievement of 17
    clinical process of care measures and eight dimensions of a
    patient’s experience of care using the HCAHPS survey and
    their improvement in meeting these standards compared to prior
    periods. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS estimates the
    value-based purchasing program will redistribute
    $850 million among the nation’s hospitals.

We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs
    that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to
    become more common and to involve a higher percentage of
    reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how
    this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could
    negatively impact our revenues.

Our
    operations could be impaired by a failure of our information
    systems.

Any system failure that causes an interruption in service or
    availability of our systems could adversely affect operations or
    delay the collection of revenues. Even though we have
    implemented network security measures, our servers are
    vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar
    disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The occurrence of any
    of these events could result in interruptions, delays, the loss
    or corruption of data, cessations in the availability of systems
    or liability under privacy and security laws, all of which could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial position and
    results of operations and harm our business reputation.

The performance of our information technology and systems is
    critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared
    services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a
    number of critical areas of our operations, including:

•

accounting and financial reporting;

•

billing and collecting accounts;

•

coding and compliance;

•

clinical systems;

•

medical records and document storage;

•

inventory management;

•

negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts
    and supply contracts; and

•

monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality
    measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.

If we
    fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health
    record systems, our operations could be adversely
    affected.

As required by the ARRA, the Secretary of HHS is in the process
    of developing and implementing an incentive payment program for
    eligible hospitals and health care professionals that adopt and
    meaningfully use certified EHR technology. HHS intends to use
    the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System
    (“PECOS”) to verify Medicare enrollment prior to
    making EHR incentive program payments. During 2011, we
    anticipate receiving Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments
    for being a meaningful user of certified EHR technology. We
    anticipate a majority of 2011 incentive payments will be
    received and recognized as revenues during the fourth quarter of
    2011. Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for our eligible
    hospitals and professionals are estimated to range from
    $275 million to $325 million for 2011. Actual
    incentive payments could vary from these estimates due to
    certain



factors such as availability of federal funding for both
    Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments, timing of the approval
    of state Medicaid incentive payment plans by CMS and our ability
    to implement and demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR
    technology.

We have incurred and will continue to incur both capital costs
    and operating expenses in order to implement our certified EHR
    technology and meet meaningful use requirements. These expenses
    are ongoing and are projected to continue over all stages of
    implementation of meaningful use. The timing of expenses will
    not correlate with the receipt of the incentive payments and the
    recognition of revenues. We estimate that operating expenses to
    implement our certified EHR technology and meet meaningful use
    will range from $125 million to $150 million for 2011.
    Actual operating expenses could vary from these estimates. If
    our hospitals and employed professionals are unable to meet the
    requirements for participation in the incentive payment program,
    including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be
    eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of
    the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, eligible
    providers that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified
    EHR technology will be subject to reduced payments from
    Medicare, beginning in federal fiscal year 2015 for eligible
    hospitals and calendar year 2015 for eligible professionals.
    Failure to implement certified EHR systems effectively and in a
    timely manner could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position and results of operations.

State
    efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care
    facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our
    operations.

Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country,
    require health care providers to obtain prior approval, known as
    a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health
    care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make
    changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these
    states consider the need for additional or expanded health care
    facilities or services. We currently operate health care
    facilities in a number of states with CON laws. The failure to
    obtain any requested CON could impair our ability to operate or
    expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely
    affect our ability to attract patients to our facilities and
    grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which
    makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and
    competitive conditions and changes in those states.

We operated 164 hospitals at December 31, 2010, and 74 of
    those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida
    and Texas facilities’ combined revenues represented
    approximately 52% of our consolidated revenues for the year
    ended December 31, 2010. This concentration makes us
    particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental
    and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any
    material change in the current payment programs or regulatory,
    economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those
    states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall
    business results.

In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other areas
    across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In
    the recent past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the
    operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal
    states, and the patient populations in those states. Our
    business activities could be harmed by a particularly active
    hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property
    insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from
    future hurricanes or other natural disasters.

We may be
    subject to liabilities from claims by the Internal Revenue
    Service.

We are currently contesting, before the IRS Appeals Division,
    certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments proposed by the IRS
    Examination Division in connection with its audit of HCA
    Inc.’s 2005 and 2006 federal income tax returns. The
    disputed items include the timing of recognition of certain
    patient service revenues, the deductibility of certain debt
    retirement costs and our method for calculating the tax
    allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, eight taxable
    periods of HCA Inc. and its predecessors ended in 1997 through
    2004, for which the primary remaining issue is the computation
    of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, are currently
    pending before the IRS Examination Division. The IRS Examination
    Division began an audit of HCA Inc.’s 2007, 2008 and 2009
    federal income tax returns in December 2010.

Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors,
    subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and
    paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements
    established with the IRS and final resolution of these disputes
    will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of
    operations or financial position.



However, if payments due upon final resolution of these issues
    exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a
    material, adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position.

We may be
    subject to liabilities from claims brought against our
    facilities.

We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices,
    including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the
    ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product
    liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions involve
    large claims and significant defense costs. We insure a portion
    of our professional liability risks through a wholly-owned
    subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured
    retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover
    insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities.
    Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary has entered into certain
    reinsurance contracts, and the obligations covered by the
    reinsurance contracts are included in its reserves for
    professional liability risks, as the subsidiary remains liable
    to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations
    under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed
    actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance,
    or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our
    results of operations and financial position could be adversely
    affected.

We are
    exposed to market risks related to changes in the market values
    of securities and interest rate changes.

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $734 million and $8 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2010. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2010, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $10 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash in
    excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
    expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a
    price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a
    normal market environment. At December 31, 2010, our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had invested $250 million
    ($251 million par value) in tax-exempt student loan auction
    rate securities that continue to experience market illiquidity.
    It is uncertain if auction-related market liquidity will resume
    for these securities. We may be required to recognize
    other-than-temporary impairments on these long-term investments
    in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or
    should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate
    due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations.
    Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed
    and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based
    on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities.

Since the
    Recapitalization, the Investors control us and may have
    conflicts of interest with us in the future.

As of December 31, 2010, the Investors indirectly owned
    approximately 96.8% of our capital stock due to the
    Recapitalization. As a result, the Investors have control over
    our decisions to enter into any significant corporate
    transaction and have the ability to prevent any transaction that
    requires the approval of stockholders. For example, the
    Investors could cause us to make acquisitions that increase the
    amount of our indebtedness or sell assets.

Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of making
    investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in
    businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. One or
    more of the Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities
    that may be complementary to our business and, as a result,
    those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So
    long as investment funds associated with or designated by the
    Sponsors continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the
    outstanding shares of our common stock, even if such amount is
    less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly
    influence or effectively control our decisions.

In addition to the hospitals listed in the above table, we
    directly or indirectly operate 106 freestanding surgery centers.
    We also operate medical office buildings in conjunction with
    some of our hospitals. These office buildings are primarily
    occupied by physicians who practice at our hospitals. Fourteen
    of our general, acute care hospitals and three of our other
    properties have been mortgaged to support our obligations under
    our senior secured cash flow credit facility and the first lien
    secured notes we issued in 2009 and 2010. These three other
    properties are also subject to second mortgages to support our
    obligations under the second lien secured notes we issued in
    2006 and 2009.

We maintain our headquarters in approximately
    1,200,000 square feet of space in the Nashville, Tennessee
    area. In addition to the headquarters in Nashville, we maintain
    regional service centers related to our shared services
    initiatives. These service centers are located in markets in
    which we operate hospitals.

We believe our headquarters, hospitals and other facilities are
    suitable for their respective uses and are, in general, adequate
    for our present needs. Our properties are subject to various
    federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating
    their operation. Management does not believe that compliance
    with such statutes and ordinances will materially affect our
    financial position or results of operations.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could materially and
    adversely affect our results of operations and financial
    position in a given period.

Government
    Investigations, Claims and Litigation

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal FCA,
    private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or
    “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit
    false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments
    from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state
    whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our
    individual facilities have received, and from time to time,
    other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may
    be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies.
    Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future
    inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their
    resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our
    financial position, results of operations and liquidity.

The Civil Division of the DOJ has contacted us in connection
    with its nationwide review of whether, in certain cases,
    hospital charges to the federal government relating to
    implantable cardio-defibrillators (“ICDs”) met the CMS
    criteria. In connection with this nationwide review, the DOJ has
    indicated that it will be reviewing certain ICD billing and
    medical records at 95 HCA hospitals; the review covers the
    period from October 2003 to the present. The review could
    potentially give rise to claims against us under the federal FCA
    or other statutes, regulations or laws. At this time, we cannot
    predict what effect, if any, this review or any resulting claims
    could have on us.

New
    Hampshire Hospital Merger Litigation

In 2006, the Foundation for Seacoast Health (the
    “Foundation”) filed suit against HCA in state court in
    New Hampshire. The Foundation alleged that both the 2006
    Recapitalization transaction and a prior 1999 intra-corporate
    transaction violated a 1983 agreement that placed certain
    restrictions on transfers of the Portsmouth Regional Hospital.
    In May 2007, the trial court ruled against the Foundation on all
    its claims. On appeal, the New Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed
    the ruling on the Recapitalization, but remanded to the trial
    court the claims based on the 1999 intra-corporate transaction.
    The trial court ruled in December 2009 that the 1999
    intra-corporate transaction breached the transfer restriction
    provisions of the 1983 agreement. The court will now conduct
    additional proceedings to determine whether any harm has flowed
    from the alleged breach, and if so, what the appropriate remedy
    should be. The court may consider whether to, among other
    things, award monetary damages, rescind or undo the 1999
    intra-corporate transfer or give the Foundation a right to
    purchase hospital assets at a price to be determined (which the
    Foundation asserts should be below the fair market value of the
    hospital). The trial for the remedies phase is currently set for
    May 2011.

General
    Liability and Other Claims

We are a party to certain proceedings relating to claims for
    income taxes and related interest before the IRS Appeals
    Division. For a description of those proceedings, see
    Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations — IRS
    Disputes” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial
    statements.

We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    for wrongful restriction of, or interference with,
    physicians’ staff privileges. In certain of these actions
    the claimants have asked for punitive damages against us, which
    may not be covered by insurance. In the opinion of management,
    the ultimate resolution of these pending claims and legal
    proceedings will not have a material, adverse effect on our
    results of operations or financial position.

PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters
    and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Our outstanding common stock is privately held, and there is no
    established public trading market for our common stock. As of
    February 1, 2011, there were 669 holders of our common
    stock. See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Liquidity and Capital
    Resources — Financing Activities” for a
    description of the restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.
    We did not pay any dividends in 2008 or 2009.

On January 27, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    vested stock options. The distribution was $17.50 per share and
    vested stock option, or $1.751 billion in the aggregate.
    The distribution was paid on February 5, 2010 to holders of
    record on February 1, 2010. The distribution was funded
    using funds available under our existing senior secured credit
    facilities and approximately $100 million of cash on hand.
    Pursuant to the terms of our stock option plans, the holders of
    nonvested stock options received a $17.50 per share reduction to
    the exercise price of their share-based awards.

On May 5, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    vested stock options. The distribution was $5.00 per share and
    vested stock option, or $500 million in the aggregate. The
    distribution was paid on May 14, 2010 to holders of record
    on May 6, 2010. The distribution was funded using funds
    available under our existing senior secured credit facilities.
    Pursuant to the terms of our stock option plans, the holders of
    nonvested stock options received a $5.00 per share reduction to
    the exercise price of their share-based awards.

On November 23, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a
    distribution to the Company’s stockholders and holders of
    stock options. The distribution was $20.00 per share and vested
    stock option, or approximately $2.1 billion in the
    aggregate. The distribution to stockholders and holders of
    vested options was paid on December 1, 2010 to holders of
    record on November 24, 2010. The distribution was funded
    using the proceeds from the November 2010 issuance of
    $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of


/


% senior
    notes due 2021, together with borrowings under our existing
    senior secured credit facilities. Pursuant to the terms of our
    stock option plans, the holders of nonvested options received
    $20.00 per share reductions (subject to certain tax imitations
    that resulted in deferred distributions for a portion of the
    declared distribution, which will be paid upon the vesting of
    the applicable stock options) to the exercise price of the
    share-based awards.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we issued and
    sold 80,750 shares of common stock in connection with the
    cashless exercise of stock options for aggregate consideration
    of $1,029,563 resulting in 46,319 net settled shares. We
    also issued and sold 186,533 shares of common stock in
    connection with the cash exercise of stock options for aggregate
    consideration of $2,378,296. The shares were issued without
    registration in reliance on the exemptions afforded by
    Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
    Rule 701 promulgated thereunder.

On April 29, 2008, we registered our common stock pursuant
    to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended.

There were no repurchases of our common stock from
    October 1, 2010 through December 31, 2010.

    Operations Summary

Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled
    $1.207 billion for 2010, compared to $1.054 billion
    for 2009. The 2010 results include net gains on sales of
    facilities of $4 million and impairments of long-lived
    assets of

    Operations Summary (Continued)

$123 million. The 2009 results include net losses on sales
    of facilities of $15 million and impairments of long-lived
    assets of $43 million.

Revenues increased to $30.683 billion for 2010 from
    $30.052 billion for 2009. Revenues increased 2.1% on both a
    consolidated basis and on a same facility basis for 2010,
    compared to 2009. The consolidated revenues increase can be
    attributed to the combined impact of a 0.9% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 1.2% increase in equivalent
    admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from a
    0.6% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission
    and a 1.4% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.

During 2010, consolidated admissions declined 0.1% and same
    facility admissions increased 0.1%, compared to 2009. Inpatient
    surgical volumes declined 1.5% on a consolidated basis and
    declined 1.4% on a same facility basis during 2010, compared to
    2009. Outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.4% on a
    consolidated basis and declined 1.2% on a same facility basis
    during 2010, compared to 2009. Emergency room visits increased
    2.0% on a consolidated basis and increased 2.1% on a same
    facility basis during 2010, compared to 2009.

For 2010, the provision for doubtful accounts declined
    $628 million, to 8.6% of revenues from 10.9% of revenues
    for 2009. The combined self-pay revenue deductions for charity
    care and uninsured discounts increased $1.892 billion for
    2010, compared to 2009. The sum of the provision for doubtful
    accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage
    of the sum of net revenues, uninsured discounts and charity
    care, was 25.6% for 2010, compared to 23.8% for 2009. Same
    facility uninsured admissions increased 5.4% and same facility
    uninsured emergency room visits increased 1.2% for 2010,
    compared to 2009.

Interest expense totaled $2.097 billion for 2010, compared
    to $1.987 billion for 2009. The $110 million increase
    in interest expense for 2010 was due primarily to an increase in
    the average effective interest rate.

Cash flows from operating activities increased
    $338 million, from $2.747 billion for 2009 to
    $3.085 billion for 2010. The increase related primarily to
    the net impact of improvements from a $198 million increase
    in net income and a $547 million reduction in income tax
    payments, offsetting a $384 million net decline from
    changes in working capital items and the provision for doubtful
    accounts.

Business
    Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high
    quality, cost-effective health care while growing our business,
    increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for
    our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our
    efforts around the following growth agenda:

Grow Our Presence in Existing Markets.

We
    believe we are well positioned in a number of large and growing
    markets that will allow us the opportunity to generate
    long-term, attractive growth through the expansion of our
    presence in these markets. We plan to continue recruiting and
    strategically collaborating with the physician community and
    adding attractive service lines such as cardiology, emergency
    services, oncology and women’s services. Additional
    components of our growth strategy include expanding our
    footprint through developing various outpatient access points,
    including surgery centers, rural outreach, freestanding
    emergency departments and walk-in clinics. Since our
    Recapitalization, we have invested significant capital into
    these markets and expect to continue to see the benefit of this
    investment.

Achieve Industry-Leading Performance in Clinical and
    Satisfaction Measures.

Achieving high levels of
    patient safety, patient satisfaction and clinical quality are
    central goals of our business model. To achieve these goals, we
    have implemented a number of initiatives including infection
    reduction initiatives, hospitalist programs, advanced health
    information technology and evidence-based medicine programs. We
    routinely analyze operational practices from our best-performing
    hospitals to identify ways to implement organization-wide
    performance

    HOLDINGS, INC.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

improvements and reduce clinical variation. We believe these
    initiatives will continue to improve patient care, help us
    achieve cost efficiencies, grow our revenues and favorably
    position us in an environment where our constituents are
    increasingly focused on quality, efficacy and efficiency.

Recruit and Employ Physicians to Meet Need for High Quality
    Health Services.

We depend on the quality and
    dedication of the health care providers and other team members
    who serve at our facilities. We believe a critical component of
    our growth strategy is our ability to successfully recruit and
    strategically collaborate with physicians and other
    professionals to provide high quality care. We attract and
    retain physicians by providing high quality, convenient
    facilities with advanced technology, by expanding our specialty
    services and by building our outpatient operations. We believe
    our continued investment in the employment, recruitment and
    retention of physicians will improve the quality of care at our
    facilities.

Continue to Leverage Our Scale and Market Positions to
    Enhance Profitability.

We believe there is
    significant opportunity to continue to grow the profitability of
    our company by fully leveraging the scale and scope of our
    franchise. We are currently pursuing next generation performance
    improvement initiatives such as contracting for services on a
    multistate basis and expanding our support infrastructure for
    additional clinical and support functions, such as physician
    credentialing, medical transcription and electronic medical
    recordkeeping. We believe our centrally managed business
    processes and ability to leverage cost-saving practices across
    our extensive network will enable us to continue to manage costs
    effectively. We are in the process of creating a subsidiary that
    will leverage key components of our support infrastructure,
    including revenue cycle management, healthcare group purchasing,
    supply chain management and staffing functions, by offering
    these services to other hospital companies.

Selectively Pursue a Disciplined Development
    Strategy.

We continue to believe there are
    significant growth opportunities in our markets. We will
    continue to provide financial and operational resources to
    successfully execute on our in-market opportunities. To
    complement our in-market growth agenda, we intend to focus on
    selectively developing and acquiring new hospitals, outpatient
    facilities and other health care service providers. We believe
    the challenges faced by the hospital industry may spur
    consolidation and we believe our size, scale, national presence
    and access to capital will position us well to participate in
    any such consolidation. We have a strong record of successfully
    acquiring and integrating hospitals and entering into joint
    ventures and intend to continue leveraging this experience.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
    disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of
    revenues and expenses. Our estimates are based on historical
    experience and various other assumptions we believe are
    reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates on
    an ongoing basis and make changes to the estimates and related
    disclosures as experience develops or new information becomes
    known. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services
    are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from payers.
    Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health
    plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related
    contractual agreements. Laws and regulations governing the
    Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to
    interpretation. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on
    a payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best
    information available regarding management’s

interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations and contract
    terms. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation
    process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and
    regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual
    terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals. We
    have invested significant resources to refine and improve our
    computerized billing systems and the information system data
    used to make contractual allowance estimates. We have developed
    standardized calculation processes and related training programs
    to improve the utility of our patient accounting systems.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, the provision of services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as
    amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of
    2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), requires
    health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services
    provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without
    regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place.
    Further, as enacted, the Health Reform Law contains provisions
    that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals,
    including requirements or incentives, which do not become
    effective until 2014, for individuals to obtain, and large
    employers to provide, insurance coverage. These mandates may
    reduce the financial impact of screening for and stabilizing
    emergency medical conditions. However, many factors are unknown
    regarding the impact of the Health Reform Law, including the
    outcome of court challenges to the constitutionality of the law
    and Congressional efforts to amend or repeal the law, how many
    previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a
    result of the law or the change, if any, in the volume of
    inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by
    and provided to previously uninsured individuals and the payer
    mix.

We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who
    meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care; therefore, they
    are not reported in revenues. Patients treated at our hospitals
    for nonelective care, who have income at or below 200% of the
    federal poverty level, are eligible for charity care. The
    federal poverty level is established by the federal government
    and is based on income and family size. We provide discounts
    from our gross charges to uninsured patients who do not qualify
    for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are similar to
    those provided to many local managed care plans. After the
    discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a
    significant portion of uninsured patients’ accounts, and we
    record significant provisions for doubtful accounts (based upon
    our historical collection experience) related to uninsured
    patients in the period the services are provided.

Due to the complexities involved in the classification and
    documentation of health care services authorized and provided,
    the estimation of revenues earned and the related reimbursement
    are often subject to interpretations that could result in
    payments that are different from our estimates. Adjustments to
    estimated Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and
    disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to
    revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the
    respective year were $52 million, $40 million and
    $32 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts, which resulted
    in net increases to revenues, related primarily to cost reports
    filed during previous years were $50 million,
    $60 million and $35 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. We expect adjustments during the next
    12 months related to Medicare and Medicaid cost report
    filings and settlements and disproportionate-share funds will
    result in increases to revenues within generally similar ranges.

Provision
    for Doubtful Accounts and the Allowance for Doubtful
    Accounts

The collection of outstanding receivables from Medicare, managed
    care payers, other third-party payers and patients is our
    primary source of cash and is critical to our operating
    performance. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured
    patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the
    primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the
    applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts
    (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision
    for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts
    relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all
    uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts.
    Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and
    external collection efforts have been performed. Our collection
    policies include a review of all accounts against certain
    standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal
    collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive
    collectibility attributes are forwarded to a secondary external
    collection agency and the other accounts are written off. The
    accounts that are not collected by the secondary external
    collection agency are written off when they are returned to us
    by the collection agency (usually within 12 months).
    Writeoffs are based upon specific identification and the
    writeoff process requires a writeoff adjustment entry to the
    patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of
    amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify
    as charity care.

The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical writeoffs and
    expected net collections, business and economic conditions,
    trends in federal, state, and private employer health care
    coverage and other collection indicators. Management relies on
    the results of detailed reviews of historical writeoffs and
    recoveries at facilities that represent a majority of our
    revenues and accounts receivable (the “hindsight
    analysis”) as a primary source of information in estimating
    the collectibility of our accounts receivable. We perform the
    hindsight analysis quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months
    accounts receivable collection and writeoff data. We believe our
    quarterly updates to the estimated allowance for doubtful
    accounts at each of our hospital facilities provide reasonable
    valuations of our accounts receivable. These routine, quarterly
    changes in estimates have not resulted in material adjustments
    to our allowance for doubtful accounts, provision for doubtful
    accounts or

period-to-period

comparisons of our results of operations. At December 31,
    2010 and 2009, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 93% and 94%, respectively, of the
    $4.249 billion and $5.176 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due
    accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured
    portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured
    portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending
    accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable
    balance.

The revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity
    care and uninsured discounts) generally have the inverse effect
    on the provision for doubtful accounts. To quantify the total
    impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe
    it is beneficial to view these revenue deductions and provision
    for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each
    separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended
    December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

    contributed to the decline in the provision for doubtful
    accounts. However, the sum of the provision for

doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a

    charity care increased from 21.9% for 2008 to 23.8% for 2009 and
    to 25.6% for 2010.

Days revenues in accounts receivable were 46 days,
    45 days and 49 days at December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Management expects a continuation of the
    challenges related to the collection of the patient due
    accounts. Adverse changes in the percentage of our patients
    having adequate health care coverage, general economic
    conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer
    mix, or trends in federal, state, and private employer health
    care coverage could affect the collection of accounts
    receivable, cash flows and results of operations.

The approximate breakdown of accounts receivable by payer
    classification as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 is set
    forth in the following table:

Our decisions, to increase uninsured discounts and to reduce the
    length of time accounts are left with our secondary collection
    agency, have contributed to improvements in our accounts

    receivable.

Professional
    Liability Claims

We, along with virtually all health care providers, operate in
    an environment with professional liability risks. Our facilities
    are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses
    up to $50 million per occurrence, subject to a
    $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention. We
    purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis for losses in
    excess of $50 million per occurrence. Our professional
    liability reserves, net of receivables under reinsurance
    contracts, do not include amounts for any estimated losses
    covered by our excess insurance coverage. Provisions for losses
    related to professional liability risks were $222 million,
    $211 million and $175 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Reserves for professional liability risks represent the
    estimated ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses
    incurred through the respective consolidated balance sheet
    dates. The estimated ultimate cost includes estimates of direct
    expenses and fees paid to outside counsel and experts, but does
    not include the general overhead costs of our insurance
    subsidiary or corporate office. Individual case reserves are
    established based upon the particular circumstances of each
    reported claim and represent our estimates of the future costs
    that will be paid on

reported claims. Case reserves are reduced as claim payments are
    made and are adjusted upward or downward as our estimates
    regarding the amounts of future losses are revised. Once the
    case reserves for known claims are determined, information is
    stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years,
    reported years, and geographic location of our hospitals.
    Several actuarial methods are employed to utilize this data to
    produce estimates of ultimate losses and reserves for incurred
    but not reported claims, including: paid and incurred
    extrapolation methods utilizing paid and incurred loss
    development to estimate ultimate losses; frequency and severity
    methods utilizing paid and incurred claims development to
    estimate ultimate average frequency (number of claims) and
    ultimate average severity (cost per claim); and
    Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods which add expected development to
    actual paid or incurred experience to estimate ultimate losses.
    These methods use our company-specific historical claims data
    and other information. Company-specific claim reporting and
    settlement data collected over an approximate

20-year

period is used in our reserve estimation process. This
    company-specific data includes information regarding our
    business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment
    expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and
    projected hospital statistical data, professional liability
    retentions for each policy year, geographic information and
    other data.

Reserves and provisions for professional liability risks are
    based upon actuarially determined estimates. The estimated
    reserve ranges, net of amounts receivable under reinsurance
    contracts, were $1.067 billion to $1.276 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and $1.024 billion to
    $1.270 billion at December 31, 2009. Our estimated
    reserves for professional liability claims may change
    significantly if future claims differ from expected trends. We
    perform sensitivity analyses which model the volatility of key
    actuarial assumptions and monitor our reserves for adequacy
    relative to all our assumptions in the aggregate. Based on our
    analysis, we believe the estimated professional liability
    reserve ranges represent the reasonably likely outcomes for
    ultimate losses. We consider the number and severity of claims
    to be the most significant assumptions in estimating reserves
    for professional liabilities. A 2% change in the expected
    frequency trend could be reasonably likely and would increase
    the reserve estimate by $16 million or reduce the reserve
    estimate by $15 million. A 2% change in the expected claim
    severity trend could be reasonably likely and would increase the
    reserve estimate by $71 million or reduce the reserve
    estimate by $65 million. We believe adequate reserves have
    been recorded for our professional liability claims; however,
    due to the complexity of the claims, the extended period of time
    to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes,
    our ultimate liability for professional liability claims could
    change by more than the estimated sensitivity amounts and could
    change materially from our current estimates.

The reserves for professional liability risks cover
    approximately 2,700 and 2,600 individual claims at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and estimates for
    unreported potential claims. The time period required to resolve
    these claims can vary depending upon the jurisdiction and
    whether the claim is settled or litigated. The average time
    period between the occurrence and payment of final settlement
    for our professional liability claims is approximately five
    years, although the facts and circumstances of each individual
    claim can result in an

occurrence-to-settlement

timeframe that varies from this average. The estimation of the
    timing of payments beyond a year can vary significantly.

Reserves for professional liability risks were
    $1.262 billion and $1.322 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The current portion of these
    reserves, $268 million and $265 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses.” Obligations covered by
    reinsurance contracts are included in the reserves for
    professional liability risks, as the insurance subsidiary
    remains liable to the extent reinsurers do not meet their
    obligations. Reserves for professional liability risks (net of
    $14 million and $53 million receivable under
    reinsurance contracts at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively) were $1.248 billion and $1.269 billion
    at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The estimated
    total net reserves for professional liability risks at

December 31, 2010 and 2009 are comprised of

    reserves for known claims and $490 million and

    not reported claims.

The favorable development related to prior years’ claims
    resulted from declining claim frequency and moderating claim
    severity trends. We believe these favorable trends are primarily
    attributable to tort reforms enacted in key states, particularly
    Texas, and our risk management and patient safety initiatives,
    particularly in the area of obstetrics.

Income
    Taxes

We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and
    liability method, under which deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized by identifying the temporary
    differences that arise from the recognition of items in
    different periods for tax and accounting purposes. Deferred tax
    assets generally represent the tax effects of amounts expensed
    in our income statement for which tax deductions will be claimed
    in future periods.

Although we believe we have properly reported taxable income and
    paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws, federal, state or
    international taxing authorities may challenge our tax positions
    upon audit. Significant judgment is required in determining and
    assessing the impact of uncertain tax positions. We report a
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax
    positions taken or expected to be taken in our income tax
    return. During each reporting period, we assess the facts and
    circumstances related to uncertain tax positions. If the
    realization of unrecognized tax benefits is deemed probable
    based upon new facts and circumstances, the estimated liability
    and the provision for income taxes are reduced in the current
    period. Final audit results may vary from our estimates.

Revenue/Volume
    Trends

Our revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the
    ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians
    and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures
    and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services.
    Gross charges typically do not reflect what our facilities are
    actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with
    third-party payers, including government programs and managed
    care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based
    upon the cost of providing services, predetermined rates per
    diagnosis,

fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not
    pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our
    guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not
    reported in revenues. We provide discounts to uninsured patients
    who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care that are similar
    to the discounts provided to many local managed care plans.

Revenues increased 2.1% to $30.683 billion for 2010 from
    $30.052 billion for 2009 and increased 5.9% for 2009 from
    $28.374 billion for 2008. The increase in revenues in 2010
    can be primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 0.9%
    increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.2% increase
    in equivalent admissions compared to the prior year. The
    increase in revenues in 2009 can be primarily attributed to the
    combined impact of a 2.6% increase in revenue per equivalent
    admission and a 3.2% increase in equivalent admissions compared
    to 2008. The decline in the rate of revenue growth from 5.9% for
    2009 compared to 2008 to 2.1% for 2010 compared to 2009 is
    primarily due to a decline in the rate of volume growth
    (equivalent admission growth declined from 3.2% for 2009
    compared to 2008 to 1.2% for 2010 compared to 2009) and a
    decline in uninsured revenues (uninsured revenues were
    $1.732 billion, $2.350 billion and $2.695 billion
    for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively) resulting from our increased uninsured discounts
    (uninsured discounts were $4.641 billion,
    $2.935 billion and $1.853 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively).

Consolidated admissions declined 0.1% in 2010 compared to 2009
    and increased 1.0% in 2009 compared to 2008. Consolidated
    inpatient surgeries declined 1.5% and consolidated outpatient
    surgeries declined 1.4% during 2010 compared to 2009.
    Consolidated inpatient surgeries increased 0.3% and consolidated
    outpatient surgeries declined 0.4% during 2009 compared to 2008.
    Consolidated emergency room visits increased 2.0% during 2010
    compared to 2009 and increased 6.6% during 2009 compared to 2008.

Same facility revenues increased 2.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and increased 6.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The 2.1% increase for 2010 can be
    primarily attributed to the combined impact of a 0.6% increase
    in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.4%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions. The 6.1%
    increase for 2009 can be primarily attributed to the combined
    impact of a 2.6% increase in same facility revenue per
    equivalent admission and a 3.4% increase in same facility
    equivalent admissions.

Same facility admissions increased 0.1% in 2010 compared to 2009

Increases in discounts to uninsured revenues have resulted in
    declines in the percentage of our inpatient revenues related to
    the uninsured, as the percentage of uninsured admissions
    compared to total admissions has increased slightly.

At December 31, 2010, we owned and operated 38 hospitals
    and 32 surgery centers in the state of Florida. Our Florida
    facilities’ revenues totaled $7.490 billion,
    $7.343 billion and $7.009 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At
    December 31, 2010, we owned and operated 36 hospitals and
    23 surgery centers in the state of Texas. Our Texas
    facilities’ revenues totaled $8.352 billion,
    $8.042 billion and $7.351 billion for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During
    2010, 2009 and 2008, 57%, 57% and 55% of our admissions and 52%,
    51% and 51%, respectively, of our revenues were generated by our
    Florida and Texas facilities. Uninsured admissions in Florida
    and Texas represented 63%, 64% and 63% of our uninsured
    admissions during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government
    health programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, which are
    highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial
    changes. We have increased the indigent care services we provide
    in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation
    with other hospitals. The state of Texas has been involved in
    the effort to increase the indigent care provided by private
    hospitals. As a result of this additional indigent care provided
    by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in
    Texas

have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent
    care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no
    contractual or legal obligation to provide such indigent care.
    The public hospital districts or counties have elected to
    transfer some portion of these available funds to the
    state’s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole
    discretion of the public hospital districts or counties. It is
    anticipated that these contributions to the state will be
    matched with federal Medicaid funds. The state then may make
    supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid
    services rendered. Hospitals receiving Medicaid supplemental
    payments may include those that are providing additional
    indigent care services. Such payments must be within the federal
    UPL established by federal regulation. Our Texas Medicaid
    revenues included $657 million, $474 million and
    $262 million during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of
    Medicaid supplemental payments pursuant to UPL programs.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides for
    Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments beginning in 2011 for
    eligible hospitals and professionals that adopt and meaningfully
    use certified electronic health record (“EHR”)
    technology. We estimate a majority of our eligible hospitals
    will attest to adopting, implementing, upgrading or
    demonstrating meaningful use of certified EHR technology during
    the fourth quarter of 2011, and we will not recognize any
    revenues related to the Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments
    until we are able to complete these attestations. We currently
    estimate that, during 2011 (primarily during our fourth
    quarter), the amount of Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments
    realizable (and revenues recognized) will be in the range of
    $275 million to $325 million. Actual incentive
    payments could vary from these estimates due to certain factors
    such as availability of federal funding for both Medicare and
    Medicaid incentive payments, timing of the approval of state
    Medicaid incentive payment plans by CMS and our ability to
    implement and demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR
    technology. We have incurred and will continue to incur both
    capital costs and operating expenses in order to implement our
    certified EHR technology and meet meaningful use requirements.
    These expenses are ongoing and are projected to continue over
    all stages of implementation of meaningful use. The timing of
    recognizing the expenses will not correlate with the receipt of
    the incentive payments and the recognition of revenues. We
    estimate that operating expenses to implement our certified EHR
    technology and meet meaningful use will be in the range of
    $125 million to $150 million for 2011. Actual
    operating expenses could vary from these estimates. There can be
    no assurance that we will be able to demonstrate meaningful use
    of certified EHR technology, and the failure to do so could have
    a material, adverse effect on our results of operations.

(a)

Cash revenues is defined as
    reported revenues less the provision for doubtful accounts. We
    use cash revenues as an analytical indicator for purposes of
    assessing the effect of uninsured patient volumes, adjusted for
    the effect of both the revenue deductions related to uninsured
    accounts (charity care and uninsured discounts) and the
    provision for doubtful accounts (which relates primarily to
    uninsured accounts), on our revenues and certain operating
    expenses, as a percentage of cash revenues. Variations in the
    revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts generally have
    the inverse effect on the provision for doubtful accounts.
    During 2010, uninsured discounts increased $1.706 billion
    and the provision for doubtful accounts declined
    $628 million, compared to 2009. During 2009, uninsured
    discounts increased $1.082 billion and the provision for
    doubtful accounts declined $133 million, compared to 2008.
    Cash revenues is commonly used as an analytical indicator within
    the health care industry. Cash revenues should not be considered
    as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted
    accounting principles. Because cash revenues is not a
    measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying
    calculations, cash revenues, as presented, may not be comparable
    to other similarly titled measures of other health care
    companies.

(b)

Salaries and benefits, supplies and
    other operating expenses, as a percentage of cash revenues (a
    non-GAAP financial measure), present the impact on these ratios
    due to the adjustment of deducting the provision for doubtful
    accounts from reported revenues and results in these ratios
    being non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these non-GAAP
    financial measures are useful to investors to provide
    disclosures of our results of operations on the same basis as
    that used by management. Management uses this information to
    compare certain operating expense categories as a percentage of
    cash revenues. Management finds this information useful to
    evaluate certain expense category trends without the influence
    of whether adjustments related to revenues for uninsured
    accounts are recorded as revenue adjustments (charity care and
    uninsured discounts) or operating expenses (provision for
    doubtful accounts), and thus the expense category trends are
    generally analyzed as a percentage of cash revenues. These
    non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered
    alternatives to GAAP financial measures. We believe this
    supplemental information provides management and the users of
    our financial statements with useful information for

period-to-period

comparisons. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when
    evaluating our overall financial performance.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009

Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled
    $1.207 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010
    compared to $1.054 billion for the year ended
    December 31, 2009. Financial results for 2010 include net
    gains on sales of facilities of $4 million and asset
    impairment charges of $123 million. Financial results for
    2009 include net losses on sales of facilities of
    $15 million and asset impairment charges of
    $43 million.

Revenues increased 2.1% to $30.683 billion for 2010 from
    $30.052 billion for 2009. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to the combined impact of a 0.9% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 1.2% increase in equivalent
    admissions compared to 2009. Same facility revenues increased
    2.1% due primarily to the combined impact of a 0.6% increase in
    same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.4%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to
    2009. Cash revenues (reported revenues less the provision for
    doubtful accounts) increased 4.7% for 2010, compared to 2009.

During 2010, consolidated admissions declined 0.1% and same
    facility admissions increased 0.1% for 2010, compared to 2009.
    Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes declined 1.5%, and same
    facility inpatient surgeries declined 1.4% during 2010 compared
    to 2009. Consolidated outpatient surgical volumes declined 1.4%,
    and same facility outpatient surgeries declined 1.2% during 2010
    compared to 2009. Emergency room visits increased 2.0% on a
    consolidated basis and increased 2.1% on a same facility basis
    during 2010 compared to 2009.

Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.7%
    in 2010 and 39.8% in 2009. Salaries and benefits, as a
    percentage of cash revenues, were 44.5% in 2010 and 44.7% in
    2009. Salaries and benefits per equivalent admission increased
    3.2% in 2010 compared to 2009. Same facility labor rate
    increases averaged 2.7% for 2010 compared to 2009.

Supplies, as a percentage of revenues, were 16.2% in both 2010
    and 2009. Supplies, as a percentage of cash revenues, were 17.7%
    in 2010 and 18.2% in 2009. Supply costs per equivalent admission
    increased 0.7% in 2010 compared to 2009. Supply costs per
    equivalent admission increased 2.4% for medical devices, 0.8%
    for blood products, and 2.9% for general medical and surgical
    items, and declined 0.7% for pharmacy supplies in 2010 compared
    to 2009.

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, increased
    to 16.3% in 2010 from 15.7% in 2009. Other operating expenses,
    as a percentage of cash revenues, increased to 17.9% in 2010
    from 17.6% in 2009. Other operating expenses are primarily
    comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and
    maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including
    professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The major
    component of the increase in other operating expenses, as a
    percentage of revenues, was related to indigent care costs in
    certain Texas markets which increased to $354 million for
    2010 from $248 million for 2009. Provisions for losses
    related to professional liability risks were $222 million
    and $211 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Provision for doubtful accounts declined $628 million, from
    $3.276 billion in 2009 to $2.648 billion in 2010, and
    as a percentage of revenues, declined to 8.6% for 2010 from
    10.9% in 2009. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured
    amounts due directly from patients. The decline in the provision
    for doubtful accounts can be attributed to the
    $1.892 billion increase in the combined self-pay revenue
    deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts during 2010,
    compared to 2009. The sum of the provision for doubtful
    accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage
    of the sum of net revenues, uninsured discounts and charity
    care, was 25.6% for 2010, compared to 23.8% for 2009. At
    December 31, 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 93% of the $4.249 billion total
    patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net
    of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts
    was being evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $246 million for 2009 to $282 million for 2010. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization declined, as a percentage of
    revenues, to 4.6% in 2010 from 4.8% in 2009. Depreciation
    expense was $1.416 billion for 2010 and $1.419 billion
    for 2009.

Interest expense increased to $2.097 billion for 2010 from
    $1.987 billion for 2009. The increase in interest expense
    was due primarily to an increase in the average effective
    interest rate. Our average debt balance was $26.751 billion
    for 2010 compared to $26.267 billion for 2009. The average
    interest rate for our long-term debt increased from 7.6% for
    2009 to 7.8% for 2010.

Net gains on sales of facilities were $4 million for 2010
    and were related to sales of real estate and other health care
    entity investments. Net losses on sales of facilities were
    $15 million for 2009 and included $8 million of net
    losses on the sales of three hospital facilities and
    $7 million of net losses on sales of real estate and other
    health care entity investments.

Impairments of long-lived assets were $123 million for 2010
    and included $74 million related to two hospital facilities
    and $49 million related to other health care entity
    investments, which includes $35 million for the writeoff of
    capitalized engineering and design costs related to certain
    building safety requirements (California earthquake standards)
    that have been revised. Impairments of long-lived assets were
    $43 million for 2009 and included $19 million related
    to goodwill and $24 million related to property and
    equipment.

The effective tax rate was 35.3% and 37.3% for 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net
    income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to
    consolidated partnerships. Our provisions for income taxes for
    2010 and 2009 were reduced by $44 million and
    $12 million, respectively, related to reductions in
    interest expense related to taxing authority examinations.
    Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax
    rate for 2010 and 2009 would have been 37.6% and 38.0%,
    respectively.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased
    from $321 million for 2009 to $366 million for 2010.
    The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests related primarily to growth in operating results of
    hospital joint ventures in two Texas markets.

Years
    Ended December 31, 2009 and 2008

Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled
    $1.054 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009

    losses on sales of facilities of $15 million and asset
    impairment charges of $43 million. Financial results for
    2008 include gains on sales of facilities of $97 million
    and asset impairment charges of $64 million.

Revenues increased 5.9% to $30.052 billion for 2009 from
    $28.374 billion for 2008. The increase in revenues was due
    primarily to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase in revenue
    per equivalent admission and a 3.2% increase in equivalent
    admissions compared to 2008. Same facility revenues increased
    6.1% due primarily to the combined impact of a 2.6% increase in
    same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 3.4%
    increase in same facility equivalent admissions compared to
    2008. Cash revenues (reported revenues less the provision for
    doubtful accounts) increased 7.2% for 2009, compared to 2008.

During 2009, consolidated admissions increased 1.0% and same
    facility admissions increased 1.2% for 2009, compared to 2008.
    Consolidated inpatient surgical volumes increased 0.3%, and same

Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined
    to 15.7% in 2009 from 16.1% in 2008. Other operating expenses,
    as a percentage of cash revenues, declined to 17.6% in 2009 from
    18.3% in 2008. Other operating expenses are primarily comprised
    of contract services, professional fees, repairs and
    maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including
    professional liability insurance) and nonincome taxes. The
    overall decline in other operating expenses, as a percentage of
    revenues, is comprised of relatively small reductions in several
    areas, including utilities, employee recruitment and travel and
    entertainment. Other operating expenses include
    $248 million and $144 million of indigent care costs
    in certain Texas markets during 2009 and 2008, respectively.
    Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks
    were $211 million and $175 million for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Provision for doubtful accounts declined $133 million, from
    $3.409 billion in 2008 to $3.276 billion in 2009, and
    as a percentage of revenues, declined to 10.9% for 2009 from
    12.0% in 2008. The provision for doubtful accounts and the
    allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to uninsured
    amounts due directly from patients. The decline in the provision
    for doubtful accounts can be attributed to the
    $1.486 billion increase in the combined self-pay revenue
    deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts during 2009,
    compared to 2008. The sum of the provision for doubtful
    accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage
    of the sum of net revenues, uninsured discounts and charity
    care, was 23.8% for 2009, compared to 21.9% for 2008. At
    December 31, 2009, our allowance for doubtful accounts
    represented approximately 94% of the $5.176 billion total
    patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net
    of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for
    which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts
    was being evaluated.

Equity in earnings of affiliates increased from
    $223 million for 2008 to $246 million for 2009. Equity
    in earnings of affiliates relates primarily to our Denver,
    Colorado market joint venture.

Depreciation and amortization decreased, as a percentage of
    revenues, to 4.8% in 2009 from 5.0% in 2008. Depreciation
    expense was $1.419 billion for 2009 and $1.412 billion
    for 2008.

Interest expense declined to $1.987 billion for 2009 from
    $2.021 billion for 2008. The decline in interest expense
    was due to reductions in the average debt balance. Our average
    debt balance was $26.267 billion for 2009 compared to
    $27.211 billion for 2008. The average interest rate for our
    long-term debt increased from 7.4% for 2008 to 7.6% for 2009.

Net losses on sales of facilities were $15 million for 2009
    and included $8 million of net losses on the sales of three
    hospital facilities and $7 million of net losses on sales
    of real estate and other health care entity investments. Gains
    on sales of facilities were $97 million for 2008 and

The effective tax rate was 37.3% and 28.5% for 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net
    income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to
    consolidated partnerships. Primarily as a result of reaching a
    settlement with the IRS Appeals Division and the revision of the
    amount of a proposed IRS adjustment related to prior taxable
    periods, we reduced our provision for income taxes by
    $69 million in 2008. Excluding the effect of these
    adjustments, the effective tax rate for 2008 would have been
    35.8%.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased
    from $229 million for 2008 to $321 million for 2009.
    The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling
    interests related primarily to growth in operating results of

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

Our primary cash requirements are paying our operating expenses,
    servicing our debt, capital expenditures on our existing
    properties, acquisitions of hospitals and other health care
    entities, distributions to stockholders and distributions to
    noncontrolling interests. Our primary cash sources are cash
    flows from operating activities, issuances of debt and equity
    securities and dispositions of hospitals and other health care
    entities.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $3.085 billion in 2010 compared to $2.747 billion in
    2009 and $1.990 billion in 2008. Working capital totaled
    $2.650 billion at December 31, 2010 and
    $2.264 billion at December 31, 2009. The
    $338 million increase in cash provided by operating
    activities for 2010, compared to 2009, was primarily comprised
    of the net impact of the $198 million increase in net
    income, a $547 million improvement from lower income tax
    payments and a $384 million decline from changes in
    operating assets and liabilities and the provision for doubtful
    accounts. The $757 million increase in cash provided by
    operating activities for 2009, compared to 2008, related
    primarily to the $473 million increase in net income and
    $143 million improvement from changes in operating assets
    and liabilities and the provision for doubtful accounts. Cash
    payments for interest and income taxes declined
    $387 million for 2010 compared to 2009 and increased
    $203 million for 2009 compared to 2008.

Cash used in investing activities was $1.039 billion,
    $1.035 billion and $1.467 billion in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures
    were $1.325 billion in 2010, $1.317 billion in 2009
    and $1.600 billion in 2008. We expended $233 million,
    $61 million and $85 million for acquisitions of
    hospitals and health care entities during 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Expenditures for acquisitions in 2010 included two
    hospital facilities, and in 2009 and 2008 were generally
    comprised of outpatient and ancillary services entities. Planned
    capital expenditures are expected to approximate
    $1.6 billion in 2011. At December 31, 2010, there were
    projects under construction which had an estimated additional
    cost to complete and equip over the next five years of
    $1.7 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures
    with internally generated and borrowed funds.

During 2010, we received cash proceeds of $37 million from
    sales of other health care entities and real estate investments.
    We also received net cash proceeds of $472 million related
    to net changes in our investments. During 2009, we received cash
    proceeds of $41 million from dispositions of three
    hospitals and sales of other health care entities and real
    estate investments. We also received net cash proceeds of
    $303 million related to net changes in our investments.
    During 2008, we received cash proceeds of $143 million from
    dispositions of two hospitals and $50 million from sales of
    other health care entities and real estate investments.

Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.947 billion in
    2010, $1.865 billion in 2009 and $451 million in 2008.
    During 2010, we paid $4.257 billion in distributions to our
    stockholders and received net proceeds of $2.533 billion
    from our debt issuance and debt repayment activities. During
    2009 and 2008, we used cash proceeds from sales of facilities
    and available cash provided by operations to make net debt
    repayments of $1.459 billion and $260 million,
    respectively. During 2010, we received contributions from
    noncontrolling interests of $57 million. During 2010, 2009
    and 2008, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of
    $342 million, $330 million and $178 million,
    respectively. We paid debt issuance costs of $50 million
    and $70 million for 2010 and 2009, respectively. During
    2010, we received income tax benefits of $114 million for
    certain items (primarily the cash distributions to holders of
    our stock options) that were deductible expenses for tax
    purposes, but were recognized as adjustments to
    stockholders’ deficit for financial reporting purposes. We
    or our affiliates, including affiliates of the Sponsors, may in
    the future repurchase portions of our debt securities, subject
    to certain limitations, from time to time in either the open
    market or through privately negotiated transactions, in
    accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The
    timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing
    trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and
    other factors, including applicable securities laws. Funds for
    the repurchase of debt securities have, and are expected to,
    come primarily from cash generated from operations and borrowed
    funds.

In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of
    capital include amounts available under our senior secured
    credit facilities ($1.314 billion as of December 31,
    2010 and $1.523 billion as of January 31,
    2011) and anticipated access to public and private debt
    markets.

During 2010, our Board of Directors declared three distributions
    to our stockholders and holders of stock options. The
    distributions totaled $42.50 per share and vested stock option,
    or $4.332 billion in the aggregate. The distributions were
    funded using funds available under our existing senior secured
    credit facilities, proceeds from the November 2010 issuance of
    $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of

On May 5, 2010, our Board of Directors granted approval for
    the Company to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (“SEC”) a registration statement on

Form S-1

relating to a proposed initial public offering of its common
    stock. We filed the

Form S-1

on May 7, 2010. In connection with the Corporate
    Reorganization, on December 15, 2010, HCA Holdings,
    Inc.’s Board of Directors granted approval for the Company
    to file with the SEC a registration statement on

Form S-1

relating to a proposed initial public offering of its common
    stock. The

Form S-1

was filed on December 22, 2010, with HCA Inc. at the same
    time filing a request to withdraw its registration statement on

Form S-1.

We intend to use the anticipated net proceeds to repay certain
    of our existing indebtedness, as will be determined prior to our
    offering, and for general corporate purposes. Upon completion of
    the offering and in connection with our termination of the
    management agreement we have with affiliates of the Investors,
    we will be required to pay a termination fee based upon the net
    present value of our future obligations under the management
    agreement.

Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiary,
    to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
    $742 million and $1.316 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Investments were reduced during
    2010 as a result of the insurance subsidiary distributing
    $500 million of excess capital to the Company. The
    insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional
    liability risks of $452 million and $590 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our facilities
    are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses
    up to $50 million per occurrence; however, since January
    2007, this coverage is subject to a $5 million per
    occurrence self-insured retention. Net reserves for the
    self-insured professional liability risks retained were
    $796 million and $679 million at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance
    recoveries, during the next 12 months are expected to
    approximate $265 million. We estimate that approximately

$165 million of the expected net claim payments during the
    next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the
    self-insured retention.

Financing
    Activities

Due to the Recapitalization, we are a highly leveraged company
    with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled
    $28.225 billion and $25.670 billion at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our interest
    expense was $2.097 billion for 2010 and $1.987 billion
    for 2009.

During March 2010, we issued $1.400 billion aggregate
    principal amount of

    proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under our senior

    proceeds from these debt issuances to repay outstanding
    indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities.

Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts
    available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
    anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be
    sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next
    twelve months.

during the recruitment agreement payment period. The physician
    commitments reflected were based on our maximum exposure on
    effective agreements at December 31, 2010.

We have entered into guarantee agreements related to certain
    leases.

Market
    Risk

We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market
    values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
    securities of our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were
    $734 million and $8 million, respectively, at
    December 31, 2010. These investments are carried at fair
    value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being
    recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At
    December 31, 2010, we had a net unrealized gain of
    $10 million on the insurance subsidiary’s investment
    securities.

We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity.
    Liquidity of the investments in debt and equity securities of
    our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary could be impaired by the
    inability to access the capital markets. Should the wholly-owned
    insurance subsidiary require significant amounts of cash in
    excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other
    expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these
    investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a
    price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a
    normal market environment. At December 31, 2010, our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had invested $250 million
    ($251 million par value) in tax-exempt student loan auction
    rate securities that continue to experience market illiquidity.
    It is uncertain if auction-related market liquidity will resume
    for these securities. We may be required to recognize

other-than-temporary

impairments on these long-term investments in future periods
    should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair
    market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings
    downgrades or other issue specific factors.

We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in
    interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
    swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations.
    Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed
    and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based
    on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions. The interest payments under these
    agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have
    been recognized in the financial statements at their respective
    fair values. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives,
    which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other
    comprehensive income, and changes in the fair value of
    derivatives which have not been designated as hedges are
    recorded in operations.

With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately
    $3.037 billion of long-term debt at December 31, 2010
    was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining
    balance in long-term debt of $25.188 billion at
    December 31, 2010 was subject to fixed rates of interest.
    Both the general level of interest rates and, for the senior
    secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable
    interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of
    amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities.
    Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our
    option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to
    the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and
    (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a LIBOR
    rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant
    interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the
    senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a
    leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our
    long-term debt increased from 7.6% for 2009 to 7.8% for 2010.

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $13.550 billion and
    €1.000 billion senior secured cash flow credit facility,
    dated as of November 17, 2006, as amended February 16,
    2007 (“the cash flow credit facility”), to allow for
    one or more future issuances of additional secured notes, which
    may include notes that are secured on a

pari passu

basis

on a junior basis with the obligations under the cash flow
    credit facility, so long as (1) such notes do not require,
    subject to certain exceptions, scheduled repayments, payment of
    principal or redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B-1
    maturity date, (2) the terms of such notes, taken as a
    whole, are not more restrictive than those in the cash flow
    credit facility and (3) no subsidiary of HCA Inc. that is
    not a U.S. guarantor is an obligor of such additional
    secured notes, and such notes are not secured by any European
    collateral securing the cash flow credit facility. The
    U.S. security documents related to the cash flow credit
    facility were also amended and restated in connection with the
    amendment in order to give effect to the security interests to
    be granted to holders of such additional secured notes.

On March 2, 2009, we amended our $2.000 billion senior
    secured asset-based revolving credit facility, dated as of
    November 17, 2006, as amended and restated as of
    June 20, 2007 (the “ABL credit facility”), to
    allow for one or more future issuances of additional secured
    notes or loans, which may include notes or loans that are
    secured on a

pari passu

basis or on a junior basis with
    the obligations under the cash flow credit facility, so long as
    (1) such notes or loans do not require, subject to certain
    exceptions, scheduled repayments, payment of principal or
    redemption prior to the scheduled term loan B-1 maturity date,
    (2) the terms of such notes or loans, as applicable, taken
    as a whole, are not more restrictive than those in the cash flow
    credit facility and (3) no subsidiary of HCA Inc. that is
    not a U.S. guarantor is an obligor of such additional
    secured notes. The amendment to the ABL credit facility also
    altered the excess facility availability requirement to include
    a separate minimum facility availability requirement applicable
    to the ABL credit facility and increased the applicable LIBOR
    and ABR margins for all borrowings under the ABL credit facility
    by 0.25% each.

On June 18, 2009, the cash flow credit facility was amended
    to permit the unlimited incurrence of new term loans to
    refinance the term loans initially incurred as well as any
    previously incurred refinancing term loans and to permit the
    establishment of commitments under a replacement cash flow
    revolver under the cash flow credit facility to replace all or a
    portion of the revolving commitments initially established under
    the cash flow credit facility as well as any previously issued
    replacement revolvers. On April 6, 2010 the cash flow
    credit facility was further amended to (i) extend the
    maturity date for $2.0 billion of the tranche B term
    loans from November 17, 2013 to March 31, 2017 and
    (ii) increase the ABR margin and LIBOR margin with respect
    to such extended term loans to 2.25% and 3.25%, respectively.

On November 8, 2010, an amended and restated joinder
    agreement was entered into with respect to the cash flow credit
    facility to establish a new replacement revolving credit series,
    which will mature on November 17, 2015. The replacement
    revolving credit commitments will become effective upon the
    earlier of (i) our receipt of all or a portion of the
    proceeds (including by way of contribution) from an initial
    public offering of the common stock of HCA Inc. or its direct or
    indirect parent company (the “IPO Proceeds Condition”)
    and (ii) May 17, 2012, subject to the satisfaction of
    certain other conditions. If the IPO Proceeds Condition has not
    been satisfied, on May 17, 2012 or, if the IPO Proceeds
    Condition has been satisfied prior to May 17, 2012, on
    November 17, 2012, the applicable ABR and LIBOR margins
    with respect to the replacement revolving loans will be
    increased from the applicable ABR and LIBOR margins of the
    existing revolving loans based upon the achievement of a certain
    leverage ratio, which level will decrease from the levels of the
    existing revolving loans.

The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was
    $28.738 billion at December 31, 2010. The estimates of
    fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.
    Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the
    potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would
    be approximately $30 million. To mitigate the impact of
    fluctuations in interest rates, we generally target a portion of
    our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.

Our international operations and the European term loan expose
    us to market risks associated with foreign currencies. In order
    to mitigate the currency exposure related to debt service
    obligations through December 31,

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS — (Continued)

Market
    Risk (Continued)

2011 under the European term loan, we have entered into cross
    currency swap agreements. A cross currency swap is an agreement
    between two parties to exchange a stream of principal and
    interest payments in one currency for a stream of principal and
    interest payments in another currency over a specified period.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income, depending on whether the derivative financial instrument
    qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it qualifies
    as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Gains and losses on
    derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they
    are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income, and
    subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of
    the hedged items when they occur. Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any portion of a
    hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to expense over the
    remaining period of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Effects
    of Inflation and Changing Prices

Various federal, state and local laws have been enacted that, in
    certain cases, limit our ability to increase prices. Revenues
    for general, acute care hospital services rendered to Medicare
    patients are established under the federal government’s
    prospective payment system. Total

fee-for-service

Medicare revenues approximated 23.5% in 2010, 22.8% in 2009 and
    23.1% in 2008 of our revenues.

Management believes hospital industry operating margins have
    been, and may continue to be, under significant pressure because
    of changes in payer mix and growth in operating expenses in
    excess of the increase in prospective payments under the
    Medicare program. In addition, as a result of increasing
    regulatory and competitive pressures, our ability to maintain
    operating margins through price increases to non-Medicare
    patients is limited.

IRS
    Disputes

At December 31, 2010, we were contesting, before the IRS
    Appeals Division, certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments
    proposed by the IRS Examination Division in connection with its
    audit of HCA Inc.’s 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns. The disputed items include the timing of recognition of
    certain patient service revenues, the deductibility of certain
    debt retirement costs and our method for calculating the tax
    allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, eight taxable
    periods of HCA Inc. and its predecessors ended in 1997 through
    2004, for which the primary remaining issue is the computation
    of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, were pending before
    the IRS Examination Division as of December 31, 2010. The
    IRS Examination Division began an audit of HCA Inc.’s 2007,
    2008 and 2009 federal income tax returns in December 2010.

Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors and
    affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in
    accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
    the IRS and final resolution of these disputes will not have a
    material, adverse effect on our results of operations or
    financial position. However, if payments due upon final
    resolution of these issues exceed our recorded estimates, such
    resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position.

promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this
    evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal

    procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
    this annual report.

Internal
    Control Over Financial Reporting

(a) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting, as such
    term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective, can
    provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial
    statement preparation and presentation.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including our principal executive officer and
    principal financial officer, we conducted an assessment of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    based on the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our
    assessment under the framework in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2010.

Ernst & Young, LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial
    statements included in this

Form 10-K,

has issued a report on our internal control over financial
    reporting, which is included herein.

(b) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public
    Accounting Firm



Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited HCA Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). HCA Holdings,
    Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
    internal control over financial reporting, and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, HCA Holdings, Inc. maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of HCA Holdings, Inc. as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 and our report dated February 17,
    2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of 2010, there have been no changes in
    our internal control over financial reporting that have
    materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect our internal control over financial reporting.

    Incorporation. Pursuant to SEC rules, the foregoing consent will
    become effective on or about March 9, 2011. The written
    consent contemplates that the Amended and Restated Certificate
    of Incorporation and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan will be
    effective immediately prior to and subject to the effectiveness
    of the registration statement relating to the anticipated
    initial public offering of the Company’s common stock. A
    notice of the foregoing stockholder action has been sent to the
    holders of record of the Company’s issued and outstanding
    capital stock as of the close of business on the record date,

Amendment
    to Employment Agreements

Effective as of February 9, 2011, the Company entered into
    amendments to employment agreements with Richard M. Bracken, R.
    Milton Johnson, Samuel N. Hazen and Beverly B. Wallace
    reflecting the new titles and responsibilities resulting from
    the Company’s internal reorganization. In addition,
    Mr. Johnson’s amendment reflects that he shall serve
    as a member of the Board of Directors of the Company for so long
    as he is an officer of the Company.

The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is
    qualified in its entirety by reference to the amendments to the

    Amendment to Stock Option Agreements Issued Under the 2006 Stock
    Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Holdings, Inc. and its
    Affiliates, as amended and restated (the “Option
    Amendment”).

The Amendment modifies the definition of the term “Investor
    Return” as contained in each option agreement.
    Specifically, the Option Amendment would allow the consideration
    of the Fair Market Value of the HCA stock held directly or
    indirectly by the Investors to be deemed “cash
    proceeds” under the Investor Return Options with respect to


/


upon each of the closing of the Company’s initial public
    offering, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012. In
    addition, the Amendment further clarifies how the term
    “Fair Market Value” will be determined for the
    purposes of the definition of “Investor Return,” which
    for these purposes will refer to the average closing trading
    price over the thirty days preceding each relevant year end
    testing date.

The foregoing description does not purport to be complete and is
    qualified in its entirety by reference to the Option Amendment,
    a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.38 hereto and is

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

HCA Holdings, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    HCA Holdings, Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the related consolidated statements of income,
    stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of HCA Holdings, Inc. at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations
    and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HCA
    Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    and our report dated February 17, 2011 expressed an
    unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 —

ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

Reporting
    Entity and Corporate Reorganization

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. completed its merger (the
    “Merger”) with Hercules Acquisition Corporation,
    pursuant to which the Company was acquired by Hercules Holding
    II, LLC (“Hercules Holding”), a Delaware limited
    liability company owned by a private investor group comprised of
    affiliates of, or funds sponsored by, Bain Capital Partners,
    LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital
    Partners (formerly Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity) (each a
    “Sponsor”), affiliates of Citigroup Inc. and Bank of
    America Corporation (the “Sponsor Assignees”) and
    affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., (the
    “Frist Entities,” and together with the Sponsors and
    the Sponsor Assignees, the “Investors”), and by
    members of management and certain other investors. The Merger,
    the financing transactions related to the Merger and other
    related transactions are collectively referred to in this annual
    report as the “Recapitalization.” The Merger was
    accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements,
    with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and
    liabilities. As a result of the Recapitalization, our
    outstanding capital stock is owned by the Investors, certain
    members of management and key employees. On April 29, 2008,
    HCA Inc.’s common stock was registered pursuant to
    Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended, thus subjecting us to the reporting requirements of
    Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
    amended (the “Exchange Act”). Our common stock is not
    traded on a national securities exchange.

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a
    new holding company structure (the “Corporate
    Reorganization”). HCA Holdings, Inc. became the new parent
    company, and HCA Inc. is now HCA Holdings, Inc.’s
    wholly-owned direct subsidiary. As part of the Corporate
    Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of common
    stock were automatically converted, on a share for share basis,
    into identical shares of HCA Holdings, Inc.’s common stock.
    HCA Holdings, Inc.’s amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, executive officers
    and board of directors are the same as HCA Inc.’s in effect
    immediately prior to the Corporate Reorganization, and the
    rights, privileges and interests of HCA Inc.’s stockholders
    remain the same with respect to HCA Holdings, Inc., as the new
    holding company. Additionally, as a result of the Corporate
    Reorganization, HCA Holdings, Inc. was deemed the successor
    registrant to HCA Inc. under the Securities and Exchange Act of
    1934, as amended, and shares of HCA Holdings, Inc.’s common
    stock are deemed registered under Section 12(g) of the
    Exchange Act.

HCA Holdings, Inc. is a holding company whose affiliates own and
    operate hospitals and related health care entities. The term
    “affiliates” includes direct and indirect subsidiaries
    of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in
    which such subsidiaries are partners. At December 31, 2010,
    these affiliates owned and operated 156 hospitals, 97
    freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient
    and ancillary services. Affiliates of HCA Holdings, Inc. are
    also partners in joint ventures that own and operate eight
    hospitals and nine freestanding surgery centers, which are
    accounted for using the equity method. HCA Holdings, Inc.’s
    facilities are located in 20 states and England. The terms
    “Company,” “HCA,” “we,”
    “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless
    otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and
    its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization and to HCA
    Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the Corporate
    Reorganization. The term “facilities” or
    “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by
    affiliates of HCA and the term “employees’’
    refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Basis of
    Presentation

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
    make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
    in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries
    and entities controlled by HCA. We generally define
    “control” as ownership of a majority of the voting
    interest of an entity. The consolidated financial statements

include entities in which we absorb a majority of the
    entity’s expected losses, receive a majority of the
    entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of
    ownership, contractual or other financial interests in the
    entity. Significant intercompany transactions have been
    eliminated. Investments in entities we do not control, but in
    which we have a substantial ownership interest and can exercise
    significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.

We have completed various acquisitions and joint venture
    transactions. The accounts of these entities have been included
    in our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent
    to our acquisition of controlling interests. The majority of our
    expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could
    be classified as general and administrative include our
    corporate office costs, which were $178 million,
    $164 million and $174 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Revenues

Revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues that
    are recorded based upon established billing rates less
    allowances for contractual adjustments. Revenues are recorded
    during the period the health care services are provided, based
    upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party
    payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies
    (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed care health
    plans, commercial insurance companies and employers. Estimates
    of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are
    based upon the payment terms specified in the related
    contractual agreements. Contractual payment terms in managed
    care agreements are generally based upon predetermined rates per
    diagnosis, per diem rates or discounted

fee-for-service

rates. Revenues related to uninsured patients and copayment and
    deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage
    may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual
    discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts
    (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to
    these uninsured accounts to record the net self pay accounts
    receivable at the estimated amounts we expect to collect. Our
    revenues from our third party payers and the uninsured for the
    years ended December 31, are summarized in the following

Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid
    programs are complex and subject to interpretation. As a result,
    there is at least a reasonable possibility recorded estimates
    will change by a material amount. Estimated reimbursement
    amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are
    prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined (in
    relation to certain government programs, primarily Medicare,
    this is generally referred to as the “cost report”
    filing and settlement process). The adjustments to estimated
    Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement amounts and
    disproportionate-share funds, which resulted in net increases to
    revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during the
    respective year were $52 million, $40 million and
    $32 million in 2010,

2009 and 2008, respectively. The adjustments to estimated
    reimbursement amounts, which resulted in net increases to
    revenues, related primarily to cost reports filed during
    previous years were $50 million, $60 million and
    $35 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
    (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital participating in the
    Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening
    examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s
    emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering
    from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the
    condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a
    facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen
    and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of
    an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. Federal and
    state laws and regulations, including but not limited to EMTALA,
    require, and our commitment to providing quality patient care
    encourages, us to provide services to patients who are
    financially unable to pay for the health care services they
    receive. Because we do not pursue collection of amounts
    determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in
    revenues. Patients treated at hospitals for nonelective care,
    who have income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level,
    are eligible for charity care. The federal poverty level is
    established by the federal government and is based on income and
    family size. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do
    not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. These discounts are
    similar to those provided to many local managed care plans. In
    implementing the discount policy, we first attempt to qualify
    uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state
    assistance or charity care. If an uninsured patient does not
    qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

The revenue deductions related to uninsured accounts (charity
    care and uninsured discounts) generally have the inverse impact
    on the provision for doubtful accounts. To quantify the total
    impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe
    it is beneficial to view charity care, uninsured discounts and
    the provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than
    each separately. A summary of these amounts for the years ended
    December 31, follows (dollars in millions):

Revenues
    (Continued)

The sum of charity care, uninsured discounts and the provision
    for doubtful accounts, as a percentage of the sum of revenues,
    uninsured discounts and charity care increased from 21.9% for
    2008, to 23.8% for 2009 and to 25.6% for 2010.

The trend of the three components of uncompensated care indicate
    that our decision to increase our uninsured discounts has
    resulted in the provision for doubtful accounts declining from
    49% of total uncompensated care for 2008 to 28% of total
    uncompensated care for 2010, and uninsured discounts have
    increased from 26% of total uncompensated care for 2008 to 48%
    of total uncompensated care for 2010.

Cash and
    Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    a maturity of three months or less when purchased. Our insurance
    subsidiary’s cash equivalent investments in excess of the
    amounts required to pay estimated professional liability claims
    during the next twelve months are not included in cash and cash
    equivalents as these funds are not available for general
    corporate purposes. Carrying values of cash and cash equivalents
    approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these
    instruments.

Our cash management system provides for daily investment of
    available balances and the funding of outstanding checks when
    presented for payment. Outstanding, but unpresented, checks
    totaling $384 million and $392 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, have been
    included in “accounts payable” in the consolidated
    balance sheets. Upon presentation for payment, these checks are
    funded through available cash balances or our credit facility.

Accounts
    Receivable

We receive payments for services rendered from federal and state
    agencies (under the Medicare and Medicaid programs), managed
    care health plans, commercial insurance companies, employers and
    patients. We recognize that revenues and receivables from
    government agencies are significant to our operations, but do
    not believe there are significant credit risks associated with
    these government agencies. We do not believe there are any other
    significant concentrations of revenues from any particular payer
    that would subject us to any significant credit risks in the
    collection of our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by
    means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written
    off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for
    doubtful accounts and subsequent recoveries are added. The
    amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon
    management’s assessment of historical and expected net
    collections, business and economic conditions, trends in
    federal, state and private employer health care coverage and
    other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts
    and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate to
    “uninsured” amounts (including copayment and
    deductible amounts from patients who have health care coverage)
    due directly from patients. Accounts are written off when all
    reasonable internal and external collection efforts have been
    performed. We consider the return of an account from the
    secondary external collection agency to be the culmination of
    our reasonable collection efforts and the timing basis for
    writing off the account balance. Writeoffs are based upon
    specific identification and the writeoff process requires a
    writeoff adjustment entry to the patient accounting system.
    Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of
    historical writeoffs and recoveries at facilities that represent
    a majority of our revenues and accounts receivable (the
    “hindsight analysis”) as a primary source of
    information to utilize in estimating the collectibility of our
    accounts receivable. We perform the hindsight analysis
    quarterly, utilizing rolling twelve-months accounts receivable
    collection and writeoff data. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, the allowance for doubtful accounts represented
    approximately 93% and 94%, respectively, of the
    $4.249 billion and $5.176 billion, respectively,
    patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due
    accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured

portion of our accounts receivable. The estimated uninsured
    portion of Medicaid pending and uninsured discount pending
    accounts is included in our patient due accounts receivable
    balance. Days revenues in accounts receivable were 46 days,
    45 days and 49 days at December 31, 2010, 2009
    and 2008, respectively. Adverse changes in general economic
    conditions, patient accounting service center operations, payer
    mix or trends in federal or state governmental health care
    coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable,
    cash flows and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out) or market.

Property
    and Equipment and Amortizable Intangibles

Depreciation expense, computed using the straight-line method,
    was $1.416 billion in 2010, $1.419 billion in 2009 and
    $1.412 billion in 2008. Buildings and improvements are
    depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging generally from
    10 to 40 years. Estimated useful lives of equipment vary
    generally from four to 10 years.

Debt issuance costs are amortized based upon the terms of the
    respective debt obligations. The gross carrying amount of
    deferred loan costs at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was
    $712 million and $689 million, respectively, and
    accumulated amortization was $338 million and
    $271 million, respectively. Amortization of deferred loan
    costs is included in interest expense and was $81 million,
    $80 million and $79 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

When events, circumstances or operating results indicate the
    carrying values of certain long-lived assets and related
    identifiable intangible assets (excluding goodwill) expected to
    be held and used, might be impaired, we prepare projections of
    the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the
    use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the
    projections indicate the recorded amounts are not expected to be
    recoverable, such amounts are reduced to estimated fair value.
    Fair value may be estimated based upon internal evaluations that
    include quantitative analyses of revenues and cash flows,
    reviews of recent sales of similar facilities and independent
    appraisals.

Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
    their carrying amounts or fair value less costs to sell or
    close. The estimates of fair value are usually based upon recent
    sales of similar assets and market responses based upon
    discussions with and offers received from potential buyers.

Investments
    of Insurance Subsidiary

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the investments of our
    wholly-owned insurance subsidiary were classified as

“available-for-sale”

as defined in Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) No. 320,

Investments — Debt
    and Equity Securities

and are recorded at fair value. The
    investment securities are held for the purpose of providing the
    funding source to pay professional liability claims covered by
    the insurance subsidiary. We perform a quarterly assessment of
    individual investment securities to determine whether declines
    in market value are temporary or

other-than-temporary.

Our investment securities evaluation process involves multiple
    subjective judgments, often involves estimating the outcome of
    future events, and requires a significant level of professional
    judgment in determining whether an impairment has occurred. We
    evaluate, among other things, the financial position and near
    term prospects of the issuer, conditions in the issuer’s
    industry, liquidity of the investment, changes in the amount or
    timing of expected future cash flows from the investment, and
    recent downgrades of the issuer by a rating agency, to determine
    if, and when, a decline in the fair value of an investment below
    amortized cost is considered

other-than-temporary.

    investment is less than amortized

cost and our ability and intent to retain the investment, to
    allow for any anticipated recovery of the investment’s fair
    value, are important components of our investment securities
    evaluation process.

Goodwill

Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment
    tests. In addition to the annual impairment review, impairment
    reviews are performed whenever circumstances indicate a possible
    impairment may exist. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at
    the reporting unit level. Reporting units are one level below
    the business segment level, and our impairment testing is
    performed at the operating division or market level. We compare
    the fair value of the reporting unit assets to the carrying
    amount, on at least an annual basis, to determine if there is
    potential impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit
    assets is less than their carrying value, we compare the fair
    value of the goodwill to its carrying value. If the fair value
    of the goodwill is less than its carrying value, an impairment
    loss is recognized. Fair value of goodwill is estimated based
    upon internal evaluations of the related long-lived assets for
    each reporting unit that include quantitative analyses of
    revenues and cash flows and reviews of recent sales of similar
    facilities. We recognized goodwill impairments of
    $14 million, $19 million and $48 million during
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

During 2010, goodwill increased by $125 million related to
    acquisitions, declined by $14 million related to
    impairments and increased by $5 million related to foreign
    currency translation and other adjustments. During 2009,
    goodwill increased by $5 million related to acquisitions,
    decreased by $19 million related to impairments and
    increased by $11 million related to foreign currency
    translation and other adjustments.

Since January 1, 2000, we have recognized total goodwill
    impairments of $102 million in the aggregate. None of the
    goodwill impairments related to evaluations of goodwill at the
    reporting unit level, as all recognized goodwill impairments
    during this period related to goodwill allocated to asset
    disposal groups.

Physician
    Recruiting Agreements

In order to recruit physicians to meet the needs of our
    hospitals and the communities they serve, we enter into minimum
    revenue guarantee arrangements to assist the recruited
    physicians during the period they are relocating and
    establishing their practices. A guarantor is required to
    recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the
    fair value of the stand-ready obligation undertaken in issuing
    the guarantee. We expense the total estimated guarantee
    liability amount at the time the physician recruiting agreement
    becomes effective as we are not able to justify recording a
    contract-based asset based upon our analysis of the related
    control, regulatory and legal considerations.

The physician recruiting liability amounts of $15 million
    and $24 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, represent the amount of expense recognized in
    excess of payments made through December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. At December 31, 2010 the maximum amount we
    could have to pay under all effective minimum revenue guarantees
    was $48 million.

Professional
    Liability Claims

Reserves for professional liability risks were
    $1.262 billion and $1.322 billion at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. The current portion of the
    reserves, $268 million and $265 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, is included in
    “other accrued expenses” in the consolidated balance
    sheets. Provisions for losses related to professional liability
    risks were $222 million, $211 million and
    $175 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and are
    included in “other operating expenses” in our
    consolidated income statements. Provisions for losses related to
    professional liability risks are based upon actuarially
    determined estimates. Loss and loss expense

reserves represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all
    reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective
    consolidated balance sheet dates. The reserves for unpaid losses
    and loss expenses are estimated using individual case-basis
    valuations and actuarial analyses. Those estimates are subject
    to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency. The
    estimates are continually reviewed and adjustments are recorded
    as experience develops or new information becomes known.
    Adjustments to the estimated reserve amounts are included in
    current operating results. The reserves for professional
    liability risks cover approximately 2,700 and 2,600 individual
    claims at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
    estimates for unreported potential claims. The time period
    required to resolve these claims can vary depending upon the
    jurisdiction and whether the claim is settled or litigated.
    During 2010 and 2009, $243 million and $272 million,
    respectively, of net payments were made for professional and
    general liability claims. The estimation of the timing of
    payments beyond a year can vary significantly. Although
    considerable variability is inherent in professional liability
    reserve estimates, we believe the reserves for losses and loss
    expenses are adequate; however, there can be no assurance the
    ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates.

A portion of our professional liability risks is insured through
    a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary. Subject to a
    $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our
    facilities are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary
    for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance
    subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability
    risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per
    occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance
    with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of
    amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

The obligations covered by reinsurance contracts are included in
    the reserves for professional liability risks, as the insurance
    subsidiary remains liable to the extent the reinsurers do not
    meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. The
    amounts receivable under the reinsurance contracts include
    $11 million and $28 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, recorded in “other assets” and
    $3 million and $25 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively, recorded in “other current
    assets”.

Financial
    Instruments

Derivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks,
    including interest rate and foreign currency exposures, and are
    not used for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize
    derivative instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements
    and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated balance
    sheets at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
    are recognized periodically either in earnings or in
    stockholders’ equity, as a component of other comprehensive
    income (loss), depending on whether the derivative financial
    instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it
    qualifies as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Generally,
    changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair
    value hedges are recorded in earnings, along with the changes in
    the fair value of the hedged items related to the hedged risk.
    Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges,
    to the extent they are effective, are recorded in other
    comprehensive income (loss), and subsequently reclassified to
    earnings to offset the impact of the forecasted transactions
    when they occur. In the event the forecasted transaction to
    which a cash flow hedge relates is no longer likely, the amount
    in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in earnings
    and generally the derivative is terminated. Changes in the fair
    value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges, and for any
    portion of a hedge that is ineffective, are reported in earnings.

The net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is
    recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from
    the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are
    deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over
    the remaining term of the debt originally covered by the
    terminated swap.

Related
    Party Transactions — Management Agreement

Affiliates of the Investors entered into a management agreement
    with us pursuant to which such affiliates will provide us with
    management services. Under the management agreement, the
    affiliates of the Investors are entitled to receive an aggregate
    annual management fee of $15 million, which amount
    increases annually at a rate equal to the percentage increase in
    Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Management Agreement) in the
    applicable year compared to the preceding year, and
    reimbursement of

out-of-pocket

expenses incurred in connection with the provision of services
    pursuant to the agreement. The annual management fee was
    $18 million for 2010 and $15 million for both 2009 and
    2008. The management agreement has an initial term expiring on
    December 31, 2016, provided that the term will be extended
    annually for one additional year unless we or the Investors
    provide notice to the other of their desire not to automatically
    extend the term. In addition, the management agreement provides
    that the affiliates of the Investors are entitled to receive a
    fee equal to 1% of the gross transaction value in connection
    with certain financing, acquisition, disposition, and change of
    control transactions, as well as a termination fee based on the
    net present value of future payment obligations under the
    management agreement in the event of an initial public offering
    or under certain other circumstances. The agreement also
    contains customary exculpation and indemnification provisions in
    favor of the Investors and their affiliates.

    The Rollover Options remain outstanding in accordance with the
    terms of the governing stock incentive plans and grant
    agreements pursuant to which the holder originally received the
    stock option grants, except the exercise price and number of
    shares subject to the rollover option agreement were adjusted so
    that the aggregate intrinsic value for each applicable option
    holder was maintained and the exercise price for substantially
    all the options was adjusted to $12.75 per option. Pursuant to
    the rollover option agreement, 10,967,500 prerecapitalization
    HCA stock options were converted into 2,285,200 Rollover
    Options, of which 1,021,900 are outstanding and exercisable at

    Stock Incentive Plan

The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Holdings
    Inc. and its Affiliates (the “2006 Plan”) is designed
    to promote the long term financial interests and growth of the
    Company and its subsidiaries by attracting and retaining
    management and other personnel and key service providers and to
    motivate management personnel by means of incentives to achieve
    long range goals and further the alignment of interests of
    participants with those of our stockholders through
    opportunities for increased stock, or stock-based, ownership in
    the Company. A portion of the options under the 2006 Plan vests
    solely based upon continued employment over a specific period of
    time, and a portion of the options vests based both upon
    continued employment over a specific period of time and upon the
    achievement of predetermined financial and Investor return
    targets over time. We granted 214,100 and 1,785,900 options
    under the 2006 Plan during 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of
    December 31, 2010, 4,495,400 options granted under the 2006
    Plan have vested, of which 4,269,800 are outstanding and

Stock
    Option Activity

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the
    grant date, using option valuation models and the weighted
    average assumptions indicated in the following table. Awards
    under the 2006 Plan generally vest based on continued employment
    and based upon achievement of certain financial and Investor
    return targets. Each grant is valued as a single award with an
    expected term equal to the average expected term of the
    component vesting tranches. We use historical option exercise
    behavior data and other factors to estimate the expected term of
    the options. The expected term of the option is limited by the
    contractual term, and employee post-vesting termination behavior
    is incorporated in the historical option exercise behavior data.
    Compensation cost is recognized on the straight-line attribution
    method. The straight-line attribution method requires that total
    compensation expense recognized must at least equal the vested
    portion of the grant-date fair value. The expected volatility is
    derived using historical stock price information of certain peer
    group companies for a period of time equal to the expected
    option term. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate
    yield on United States Treasury Strips having a life equal to
    the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life
    is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held
    before it is exercised.

ACQUISITIONS
    AND DISPOSITIONS

During 2010, we paid $163 million to acquire two hospitals
    and $70 million to acquire other health care entities.
    During 2009, we paid $61 million to acquire nonhospital
    health care entities. During 2008, we paid $18 million to
    acquire one hospital and $67 million to acquire other
    health care entities. Purchase price amounts have been allocated
    to the related assets acquired and liabilities assumed based
    upon their respective fair values. The purchase price paid in
    excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired
    entities aggregated $125 million, $5 million and
    $43 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts and
    operations of the acquired entities subsequent to the respective
    acquisition dates. The pro forma effects of the acquired
    entities on our results of operations for periods prior to the
    respective acquisition dates were not significant.

During 2010, we received proceeds of $37 million and
    recognized a net pretax gain of $4 million ($2 million
    after tax) from sales of nonhospital health care entities and
    real estate investments. During 2009, we received proceeds of
    $3 million and recognized a net pretax loss of
    $8 million ($5 million after tax) on the sales of
    three hospitals. We also received proceeds of $38 million
    and recognized a net pretax loss of $7 million
    ($4 million after tax) from sales of other health care
    entities and real estate investments. During 2008, we received
    proceeds of $143 million and recognized a net pretax gain
    of $81 million ($48 million after tax) from the sales
    of two hospitals. We also received proceeds of $50 million

IMPAIRMENTS
    OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During 2010, we recorded pretax charges of $123 million to

    value. The $123 million asset impairment includes
    $57 million related to a hospital facility in our Central
    Group, $5 million related to other health care entity
    investments in our Eastern Group, $17 million related to a
    hospital facility in our Western Group and $44 million
    related to Corporate and other, which includes $35 million
    for the writeoff of capitalized engineering and design costs
    related to certain building safety requirements (California
    earthquake standards) that have been revised. During 2009, we
    recorded pretax charges of $43 million to reduce the
    carrying value of identified assets to estimated fair value. The
    $43 million asset impairment includes $15 million
    related to certain hospital facilities and other health care
    entity investments in our Central Group, $14 million
    related to other health care entity investments in our Eastern
    Group and $14 million related to certain hospital
    facilities in our Western Group. During 2008, we recorded pretax
    charges of $64 million to reduce the carrying value of
    identified assets to estimated fair value. The $64 million
    asset impairment includes $55 million related to other
    health care entity investments in our Eastern Group and
    $9 million related to certain hospital facilities in our
    Central Group.

The asset impairment charges did not have a significant impact
    on our operations or cash flows and are not expected to
    significantly impact cash flows for future periods. The
    impairment charges affected our property and equipment asset
    category by $109 million, $24 million and

At December 31, 2010, state net operating loss
    carryforwards (expiring in years 2011 through
    2030) available to offset future taxable income
    approximated $65 million. Utilization of net operating loss
    carryforwards in any one year may be limited and, in certain
    cases, result in an adjustment to intangible assets. Net
    deferred tax assets related to such carryforwards are not

At December 31, 2010, we were contesting, before the IRS
    Appeals Division, certain claimed deficiencies and adjustments
    proposed by the IRS Examination Division in connection with its
    audit of HCA Inc.’s 2005 and 2006 federal income tax
    returns. The disputed items include the timing of recognition of
    certain patient service revenues, the deductibility of certain
    debt retirement costs and our method for calculating the tax
    allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, eight taxable
    periods of HCA Inc. and its predecessors ended in 1997 through
    2004, for which the primary remaining issue is the computation
    of the tax allowance for doubtful accounts, were pending before
    the IRS Examination Division as of December 31, 2010. The

    recorded as reductions of the related deferred tax assets, as of
    December 31, 2010 ($628 million, $156 million and
    $13 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2009).
    Unrecognized tax benefits of $190 million
    ($236 million as of December 31, 2009) would
    affect the effective rate, if recognized. The liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits does not reflect deferred tax assets
    of $63 million ($77 million as of December 31,
    2009) related to deductible interest and state income taxes
    or a refundable deposit of $82 million ($104 million
    as of December 31, 2009), which is recorded in noncurrent
    assets.

Depending on the resolution of the IRS disputes, the completion
    of examinations by federal, state or international taxing
    authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for
    specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably
    possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
    significantly increase or decrease within the next
    12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the
    range of any possible change.

INVESTMENTS
    OF INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY (Continued)

At December 31, 2010 and 2009 the investments of our
    insurance subsidiary were classified as

“available-for-sale.”

During 2010, investments in debt securities were reduced as a
    result of the insurance subsidiary distributing
    $500 million of excess capital to the Company. Changes in
    temporary unrealized gains and losses are recorded as
    adjustments to other comprehensive income (loss). At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, $92 million and
    $100 million, respectively, of our investments were subject
    to the restrictions included in insurance bond collateralization
    and assumed reinsurance contracts.

Scheduled maturities of investments in debt securities at
    December 31, 2010 were as follows (dollars in millions):

The average expected maturity of the investments in debt
    securities at December 31, 2010 was 2.9 years,
    compared to the average scheduled maturity of 11.4 years.
    Expected and scheduled maturities may differ because the issuers
    of certain securities have the right to call, prepay or
    otherwise redeem such obligations prior to their scheduled
    maturity date. The average expected maturities for our auction
    rate and asset-backed securities were derived from valuation
    models of expected cash flows and involved management’s
    judgment. The average expected maturities for our auction rate
    and asset-backed securities at December 31, 2010 were
    4.1 years and 5.6 years, respectively, compared to
    average scheduled maturities of 24.1 years and
    25.6 years, respectively.

    Pay-variable interest rate swaps effectively convert fixed
    interest rate obligations to LIBOR indexed variable rate
    obligations. The interest payments under these agreements are
    settled on a net basis. The net interest payments, based on the
    notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing
    of the related liabilities, for the interest rate swap
    agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The
    notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used
    to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets
    or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions.

Cross
    Currency Swaps

The Company and certain subsidiaries have incurred obligations
    and entered into various intercompany transactions where such
    obligations are denominated in currencies, other than the
    functional currencies of the parties executing the trade. In
    order to mitigate the currency exposure risks and better match
    the cash flows of our obligations and intercompany transactions
    with cash flows from operations, we enter into various cross
    currency swaps. Our credit risk related to these agreements is
    considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy
    financial institutions.

Certain of our cross currency swaps are not designated as
    hedges, and changes in fair value are recognized in results of

    Contingent Features

We have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties
    that contain a provision where we could be declared in default
    on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying
    indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on
    the indebtedness. As of December 31, 2010, we have not been
    required to post any collateral related to these agreements. If
    we had breached these provisions at December 31, 2010, we
    would have been required to settle our obligations under the
    agreements at their aggregate, estimated termination value of
    $404 million.

ASSETS
    AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(“ASC 820”) defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
    about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to reported
    balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair
    value under existing accounting pronouncements.

ASC 820 emphasizes fair value is a market-based measurement, not
    an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value
    measurement should be determined based on the assumptions market
    participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a
    basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair
    value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value
    hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant
    assumptions based on market data obtained from sources
    independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs
    classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the
    reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant
    assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3
    of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs
    are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1
    that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for
    similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as
    inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted
    prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
    yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.
    Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or
    liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own
    assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market
    activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value
    measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair
    value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within
    which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the
    lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in
    its entirety. Our assessment of the significance

NOTE 9 —

ASSETS
    AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (Continued)

of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its
    entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to
    the asset or liability.

Cash
    Traded Investments

Our cash traded investments are generally classified within
    Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because
    they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer
    quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable
    levels of price transparency. Certain types of cash traded
    instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value
    hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have
    little or no price transparency. Such instruments include
    auction rate securities (“ARS”) and limited
    partnership investments. The transaction price is initially used
    as the best estimate of fair value.

Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary had investments in
    tax-exempt ARS, which are backed by student loans substantially
    guaranteed by the federal government, of $250 million
    ($251 million par value) at December 31, 2010. We do
    not currently intend to attempt to sell the ARS as the liquidity
    needs of our insurance subsidiary are expected to be met by
    other investments in its investment portfolio. These securities
    continue to accrue and pay interest semi-annually based on the
    failed auction maximum rate formulas stated in their respective
    Official Statements. During 2010 and 2009, certain issuers and
    their broker/dealers redeemed or repurchased $150 million
    and $172 million, respectively, of our ARS at par value.
    The valuation of these securities involved management’s
    judgment, after consideration of market factors and the absence
    of market transparency, market liquidity and observable inputs.
    Our valuation models derived a fair market value compared to
    tax-equivalent yields of other student loan backed variable rate
    securities of similar credit worthiness and similar effective
    maturities.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We have entered into interest rate and cross currency swap
    agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest
    rates and foreign currency risks. The valuation of these
    instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation
    techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the
    expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects
    the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period
    to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
    interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates and implied
    volatilities. To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we
    incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own
    nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s
    nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.

Although we determined the majority of the inputs used to value
    our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value
    hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our
    derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of
    current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by
    us and our counterparties. We assessed the significance of the
    impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall
    valuation of our derivative positions and at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, we determined the credit valuation adjustments
    were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

In connection with the Recapitalization, we entered into
    (i) a $2.000 billion senior secured asset-based
    revolving credit facility with a borrowing base of 85% of
    eligible accounts receivable, subject to customary reserves and
    eligibility criteria ($125 million available at
    December 31, 2010) (the “ABL credit facility”)
    and (ii) a senior secured credit agreement (the “cash
    flow credit facility” and, together with the ABL credit
    facility, the “senior secured credit facilities”),
    consisting of a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility
    ($1.189 billion available at December 31, 2010 after
    giving effect to certain outstanding letters of credit), a
    $2.750 billion term loan A ($1.618 billion outstanding
    at December 31, 2010), a $8.800 billion term loan B
    consisting of a $6.800 billion senior secured term loan B-1
    and a $2.000 billion senior secured term loan B-2
    ($3.525 billion outstanding under term loan B-1 at
    December 31, 2010 and $2.000 billion outstanding under
    term loan B-2 at December 31, 2010) and a
    €1.000 billion European term loan
    (€291 million, or $387 million, outstanding at
    December 31, 2010) under which one of our European
    subsidiaries is the borrower.

Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities bear
    interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a
    base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the
    federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (2) the prime rate of Bank
    of America or (b) a LIBOR rate for the currency of such
    borrowing for the relevant interest period, plus, in each case,
    an applicable margin. The applicable margin for borrowings under
    the senior secured credit facilities may be reduced subject to
    attaining certain leverage ratios.

The ABL credit facility and the $2.000 billion revolving
    credit facility portion of the cash flow credit facility expire
    November 2012. The term loan facilities require quarterly
    installment payments. The final payment under term loan A is in
    November 2012. The final payments under term loan B-1 and the
    European term loan are in November 2013. During April 2010, we
    entered into an amendment of our senior secured term loan B
    facility extending the maturity of $2.000 billion of loans
    outstanding thereunder from November 2013 to March 2017. On
    November 8, 2010, an amended and restated joinder agreement
    was entered into with respect to the cash flow credit facility
    to establish a new replacement revolving credit series, which
    will mature on November 17, 2015. Under the

amended and restated joinder agreement, these replacement
    revolving credit commitments will become effective, subject to
    certain conditions, upon the earlier of (i) the initial
    public offering of our common stock and (ii) May 17,
    2012. The senior secured credit facilities contain a number of
    covenants that restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (and
    some or all of our subsidiaries’) ability to incur
    additional indebtedness, repay subordinated indebtedness, create
    liens on assets, sell assets, make investments, loans or
    advances, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay
    dividends and distributions, and enter into sale and leaseback
    transactions. In addition, we are required to satisfy and
    maintain a maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the cash
    flow credit facility and, in certain situations under the ABL
    credit facility, a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant.

    proceeds from these debt issuances to repay outstanding
    indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities.

We use interest rate swap agreements to manage the variable rate
    exposure of our debt portfolio. At December 31, 2010, we
    had entered into effective interest rate swap agreements, in a
    total notional amount of $7.100 billion, in order to hedge
    a portion of our exposure to variable rate interest payments

certain special purpose subsidiaries that only guarantee and
    pledge their assets under our ABL credit facility). In addition,
    borrowings under the European term loan are guaranteed by all
    material, wholly-owned European subsidiaries.

All obligations under the ABL credit facility, and the
    guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to
    permitted liens and other exceptions, by a first-priority lien
    on substantially all of the receivables of the borrowers and
    each guarantor under such ABL credit facility (the
    “Receivables Collateral”).

All obligations under the cash flow credit facility and the
    guarantees of such obligations are secured, subject to permitted
    liens and other exceptions, by:

•

a first-priority lien on the capital stock owned by HCA Inc., or
    by any U.S. guarantor, in each of their respective
    first-tier subsidiaries;

•

a first-priority lien on substantially all present and future
    assets of HCA Inc. and of each U.S. guarantor other than
    (i) “Principal Properties” (as defined in the
    1993 Indenture), (ii) certain other real properties and
    (iii) deposit accounts, other bank or securities accounts,
    cash, leaseholds, motor-vehicles and certain other
    exceptions; and

•

a second-priority lien on certain of the Receivables Collateral.

Our senior secured first lien notes and the related guarantees
    are secured by first-priority liens, subject to permitted liens,
    on our and our subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to
    certain exceptions, that secure our cash flow credit facility on
    a first-priority basis and are secured by second priority liens,
    subject to permitted liens, on our and our subsidiary
    guarantors’ assets that secure our ABL credit facility on a
    first priority basis and our other cash flow credit facility on
    a second-priority basis.

Our second lien debt and the related guarantees are secured by
    second-priority liens, subject to permitted liens, on our and
    our subsidiary guarantors’ assets, subject to certain
    exceptions, that secure our cash flow credit facility on a
    first-priority basis and are secured by third-priority liens,
    subject to permitted liens, on our and our subsidiary
    guarantors’ assets that secure our asset-based revolving
    credit facility on a first priority basis and our other cash

CONTINGENCIES

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a
    result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
    proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or
    asserted against us. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims
    or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material,
    adverse effect on our results of operations or financial
    position.

Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by
    various governmental agencies. Under the federal false claims
    act (“FCA”) private parties have the right to bring

qui tam

, or “whistleblower,” suits against
    companies that submit false claims for payments to, or
    improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states
    have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims
    provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received
    government inquiries from federal and state agencies and our
    facilities may receive such inquiries in future periods.
    Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future
    inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their
    resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results
    of operations or financial position.

CONTINGENCIES
    (Continued)

We are subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary
    course of business, including claims for personal injuries or
    wrongful restriction of, or interference with, physicians’
    staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may
    seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by
    insurance. It is management’s opinion that the ultimate
    resolution of these pending claims and legal proceedings will
    not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations
    or financial position.

The Civil Division of the Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) has contacted us in connection with its
    nationwide review of whether, in certain cases, hospital charges
    to the federal government relating to implantable
    cardio-defibrillators (“ICDs”) met the Centers for
    Medicare & Medicaid Services’ criteria. In connection
    with this nationwide review, the DOJ has indicated it will be
    reviewing certain ICD billing and medical records at 95 HCA
    hospitals; the review covers the period from October 2003 to the
    present. The review could potentially give rise to claims
    against us under the federal FCA or other statutes, regulations
    or laws. At this time, we cannot predict what effect, if any,
    this review or any resulting claims could have on us.

CAPITAL
    STOCK

The Company’s certificate of incorporation was amended and
    restated, effective November 19, 2010. The amended and
    restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the Company to
    issue up to 125,000,000 shares of common stock, and our
    amended and restated by-laws set the number of directors
    constituting the board of directors of the Company at not less
    than one nor more than 15.

Distributions

During 2010, our Board of Directors declared three distributions
    to its stockholders and holders of stock options. The
    distributions totaled $42.50 per share and vested stock option,
    or $4.332 billion in the aggregate. The distributions were
    funded using funds available under our senior secured credit
    facilities, proceeds from the 2021 Notes offering and cash on
    hand. Pursuant to the terms of our stock option plans, the
    holders of nonvested stock options received $42.50 per share
    reductions (subject to certain tax related limitations for
    certain stock options that resulted in deferred distributions
    for a portion of the declared distribution, which will be paid
    upon the vesting of the applicable stock options) to the
    exercise price of their share-based awards.

Registration
    Statement Filings

On May 5, 2010, HCA Inc.’s Board of Directors granted
    approval for HCA Inc. to file with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (“SEC”) a registration statement on

Form S-1

relating to a proposed initial public offering of its common
    stock. The

Form S-1

was filed on May 7, 2010.

In connection with the Corporate Reorganization, on
    December 15, 2010, HCA Holdings, Inc.’s Board of
    Directors granted approval for the Company to file with the SEC
    a registration statement on

Form S-1

relating to a proposed initial public offering of its common
    stock. The

Form S-1

was filed on December 22, 2010, and HCA Inc. filed a
    request to withdraw its registration statement on

Form S-1

at the same time.

Stockholder
    Agreements and Equity Securities with Contingent
    Redemption Rights

The stockholder agreements, among other things, contain
    agreements among the parties with respect to restrictions on the
    transfer of shares, including tag along rights and drag along
    rights, registration rights (including customary indemnification
    provisions) and other rights. Pursuant to the management
    stockholder agreements, the applicable employees can elect to
    have the Company redeem their common stock and vested stock
    options in the events of death or permanent disability, prior to
    the consummation of the initial public offering of common stock
    by the Company. At December 31, 2010, there were 2,216,500
    common shares and 5,291,700 vested stock options that were
    subject to these contingent redemption terms.

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

We maintain contributory, defined contribution benefit plans
    that are available to employees who meet certain minimum
    requirements. Certain of the plans require that we match
    specified percentages of participant contributions up to certain
    maximum levels (generally, 100% of the first 3% to 9%, depending
    upon years of vesting service, of compensation deferred by
    participants for periods subsequent to March 31, 2008, and
    50% of the first 3% of compensation deferred by participants for
    periods prior to April 1, 2008). The cost of these plans
    totaled $307 million for 2010, $283 million for 2009
    and $233 million for 2008. Our contributions are funded
    periodically during each year.

We maintained a noncontributory, defined contribution retirement
    plan which covered substantially all employees. Benefits were
    determined as a percentage of a participant’s salary and
    vest over specified periods of employee service. Benefits
    expense was $46 million for 2008. There was no expense for
    2010 and 2009 as the noncontributory plan and the related
    participant account balances were merged into the contributory
    HCA 401(k) Plan effective April 1, 2008.

We maintain the noncontributory, nonqualified Restoration Plan
    to provide certain retirement benefits for eligible employees.
    Eligibility for the Restoration Plan is based upon earning
    eligible compensation in excess of the Social Security Wage Base
    and attaining 1,000 or more hours of service during the plan
    year. Company credits to participants’ account balances
    (the Restoration Plan is not funded) depend upon
    participants’ compensation, years of vesting service and
    certain IRS limitations related to the HCA 401(k) plan. Benefits
    expense under this plan was $19 million for 2010,
    $26 million for 2009 and $2 million for 2008. Accrued
    benefits liabilities under this plan totaled $84 million at
    December 31, 2010 and $73 million at December 31,
    2009.

We maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
    (“SERP”) for certain executives. The plan is designed
    to ensure that upon retirement the participant receives the
    value of a prescribed life annuity from the combination of the
    SERP and our other benefit plans. Benefits expense under the
    plan was $27 million for 2010, $24 million for 2009
    and $20 million for 2008. Accrued benefits liabilities
    under this plan totaled $197 million at December 31,
    2010 and $152 million at December 31, 2009.

We maintain defined benefit pension plans which resulted from
    certain hospital acquisitions in prior years. Benefits expense
    under these plans was $30 million for 2010,
    $39 million for 2009, and $24 million for 2008.
    Accrued benefits liabilities under these plans totaled
    $131 million at December 31, 2010 and
    $115 million at December 31, 2009.

SEGMENT
    AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals
    and related health care entities. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, approximately 23.5%,
    22.8% and 23.1%, respectively, of our revenues related to
    patients participating in the

fee-for-service

Medicare program.

Our operations are structured into three geographically
    organized groups: the Eastern Group includes 48 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Eastern United States, the Central
    Group includes 46 consolidating hospitals located in the Central
    United States and the Western Group includes 56 consolidating
    hospitals located in the Western United States. We also operate
    six consolidating hospitals in England, and these facilities are
    included in the Corporate and other group.

Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before depreciation
    and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains) on sales of
    facilities, impairments of long-lived assets, income taxes and
    net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We use
    adjusted segment EBITDA as an analytical indicator for purposes
    of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing
    performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an
    analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also
    serves as a measure of leverage capacity and debt service
    ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a
    measure of financial performance under

generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded
    from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant components in
    understanding and assessing financial performance. Because
    adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is
    thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted segment
    EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly
    titled measures of other companies.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

NOTE 17 —

SUPPLEMENTAL
    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER
    COLLATERAL-RELATED INFORMATION (Continued)

Healthtrust, Inc. — The Hospital Company
    (“Healthtrust”) is the first-tier subsidiary of HCA
    Inc. The common stock of Healthtrust has been pledged as
    collateral for the senior secured credit facilities and senior
    secured notes described in Note 9.

Rule 3-16

of

Regulation S-X

under the Securities Act requires the filing of separate
    financial statements for any affiliate of the registrant whose
    securities constitute a substantial portion of the collateral
    for any class of securities registered or being registered. We
    believe the separate financial statements requirement applies to
    Healthtrust due to the pledge of its common stock as collateral
    for the senior secured notes. Due to the corporate structure
    relationship of HCA and Healthtrust, HCA’s operating
    subsidiaries are also the operating subsidiaries of Healthtrust.
    The corporate structure relationship, combined with the
    application of push-down accounting in Healthtrust’s
    consolidated financial statements related to HCA’s debt and
    financial instruments, results in the consolidated financial
    statements of Healthtrust being substantially identical to the
    consolidated financial statements of HCA. The consolidated
    financial statements of HCA and Healthtrust present the
    identical amounts for revenues, expenses, net income, assets,
    liabilities, total stockholders’ deficit, net cash provided
    by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities
    and net cash used in financing activities. Certain individual
    line items in the HCA consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ deficit and cash flows are combined into one
    line item in the Healthtrust consolidated statements of
    stockholder’s deficit and cash flows.

Reconciliations of the HCA Holdings, Inc. Consolidated
    Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit and Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows presentations to the Healthtrust,
    Inc. — The Hospital Company Consolidated Statements of
    Stockholder’s Deficit and Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows presentations for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008 are as follows (dollars in millions):

    EVENT

February 16, 2011 Increase in Authorized Shares and
    Stock Split

On February 16, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an
    increase in the number of authorized shares to
    1,800,000,000 shares of common stock and a 4.505 -to-one
    split of the Company’s issued and outstanding common stock.
    The increase in the authorized shares and the stock split are
    expected to become effective immediately prior to the
    effectiveness of the initial public offering of our common
    stock. Since the increase in the authorized shares and the stock
    split are not yet effective, the common share and per common
    share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and
    notes to consolidated financial statements have not been
    restated.
