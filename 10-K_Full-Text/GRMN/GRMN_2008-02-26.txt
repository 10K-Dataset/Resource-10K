CAUTIONARY
      STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FORWARD-LOOKING COMMENTS

The
      discussions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain statements
      concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based
      upon assumptions by the Company's management, as of the date of this Annual
      Report, including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by the
      Company. In addition, management may make forward-looking statements orally
      or
      in other writings, including, but not limited to, in press releases, in the
      annual report to shareholders and in the Company’s other filings with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers can identify these forward-looking
      statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes” or
      similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. Forward-looking statements include
      any discussion of the trends and other factors that drive our business and
      future results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Conditions and Results of Operation.” Readers are cautioned not to place undue
      reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their
      date.
      If any of management's assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated
      circumstances arise, the Company's actual results could materially differ from
      those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could
      be
      caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not
      limited to, those factors identified under Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Readers are
      strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any
      forward-looking statements concerning the Company. The Company does not
      undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report to
      reflect future events or developments.

Company
      Overview

Garmin
      is
      a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
      devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System (“GPS”)
      technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse family
      of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other
      navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile,
      outdoor/fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.


Overview
      of the Global Positioning System

The
      Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the
      precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
      technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
      The
      satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained
      and
      operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing
      satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.
      Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.

Prior
      to
      May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy
      of
      civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (‘‘SA’’) for
      national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a
      radius of 100 meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense
      discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004,
      the
      Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA
      again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial
      of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS
      receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters
      or
      less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The
      accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques
      which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
      to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a
      Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’) comprising ground reference stations
      and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available
      in the United States and portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3
      meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
      and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased
      accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers
      for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS
      system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was
      available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics
      equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference
      stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Recent
      Developments in the Company’s Business

Since
      the
      inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 31 million products, which
      includes the delivery of over 12.3 million products during 2007.

Automotive/Mobile
      Product Introductions

Garmin
      launched many new automotive products in 2007. Among these were many new
      versions of Garmin’s popular

nüvi

®

personal
      navigation device (PND) product line. The nüvi family was expanded in early 2007
      to include the nüvi 370 and the nüvi 670, which added built-in European maps to
      the many features of the nüvi 360 and 660 models. The nüvi 680 was also
      introduced (along with the StreetPilot® c580) as the first PNDs to incorporate
      real-time traffic reports, gas prices, weather conditions, and movie times
      from
      Microsoft’s MSN Direct network. Garmin later released the nüvi 2XX family of
      PNDs (nüvi 200, 250, 260, and 270, as well as 200W and 250W widescreen models),
      which represented an entry-level category of the popular nüvi family with a
      sleek new design, including a built-in internal GPS antenna. In September 2007,
      Garmin released the high-end, full-feature nüvi 700 series (nüvi 750, nüvi 760,
      and nüvi 770 models). The nüvi 700 series combines the sleek form factor of the
      nüvi 200 widescreen models with full-feature functionality, including a built-in
      FM transmitter, MP3 player,

Bluetooth®

hands-free technology (in the nüvi 750, 760 and 780), a built-in FM traffic
      receiver, and the ability to add custom points of interest (POIs).

Garmin
      continued its expansion in the rental car market in 2007 by announcing
      agreements to supply GPS navigation devices to National Car Rental and Alamo
      Rent A Car. Garmin also continued to expand its presence with automotive
      manufacturers and dealers in 2007. Ford Component Sales, LLC, a subsidiary
      of
      Ford Motor Company, began offering the nüvi 680 and nüvi 360 for sale in certain
      Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealerships in the United States. Honda Access Europe
      N.V. announced that a customized version of the nüvi 360 will be offered in
      certain Honda dealerships in Europe for six different Honda models of vehicles.
      In November 2007, Volvo Cars Corporation selected Garmin’s nüvi 760 as a
      customized navigation solution for select Volvo vehicles, including the new
      Volvo C30 and Volvo XC70. The Volvo solution is a dealer-fitted accessory kit
      -
      which includes a custom dashboard bracket - that will be sold through certain
      Volvo dealerships in Europe and North America.


Garmin
      also expanded its Garmin Mobile™ service and family of products in 2007. In
      October, Garmin announced Garmin Mobile XT, a pre-loaded (microSD card) software
      application for certain smartphones that provides preloaded maps and dynamic
      content (such as real-time traffic alerts and fuel prices) but does not require
      monthly fees or subscriptions. Garmin also announced that Handmark, a global
      leader in the distribution of mobile media, will distribute Garmin Mobile for
      BlackBerry devices enabled with GPS through Handmark’s distribution channels.

Outdoor/
      Fitness Product Introductions

In
      the
      category of fitness products, Garmin expanded its Forerunner® line with the
      Forerunner 50, an advanced fitness watch that allows runners and walkers to
      track their workouts and automatically upload their data (via a wireless USB
      ANT™ Stick) to a personal computer. Garmin also introduced its next generation
      GPS-enabled personal training devices for cyclists, the Edge® 605 and 705. To
      help promote the release of the new Forerunner 50 product and its full line
      of
      fitness products, Garmin helped sponsor more than a dozen marathons and cycling
      events in 2007, including the Boston, Chicago, and New York marathons and the
      Amgen Tour of California cycling race.

Garmin
      also introduced several new product offerings in the Outdoor category, including
      the Astro™ GPS Dog Tracking System designed for hunting dogs and two new models
      of the Rino® GPS two-way radio family, the Rino 520HCx and 530HCx, which added a
      high-sensitivity GPS receiver and a microSD card slot for detailed mapping
      data.

Marine
      Product Introductions

Garmin
      introduced the new GPSMAP 5000 series of multifunction chartplotters in 2007,
      which improved upon prior multifunction displays by offering a touchscreen
      interface and other advancements. In November 2007, Garmin announced a new
      line
      of marine products for the 2008 boating season, including a line of big-screen
      multi-function displays, a new fuel sensor, instruments, and a new marine
      autopilot system (the GHP™ 10).

Aviation
      Product Introductions and Certifications

Garmin’s
      G1000 integrated avionics suite received FAA supplemental type certification
      (STC) in November 2007 for incorporation into the King Air C90A/GT aircraft.
      Garmin is also working on Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) programs for
      the
      King Air 200 and B200 in an effort to enable the G1000 to be available as a
      retrofit option for those models. In addition, announcements were made in 2007
      that the G1000 integrated avionics suite was selected as the avionics platform
      for the EADS SOCATA TBM 850 turboprop, the Cessna Aircraft Company’s Caravan
      aircraft models, and as an option on the Piper Aircraft Saratoga II TC and
      Piper
      6X planes. Piper also announced that Garmin’s all-glass avionics suite was
      selected for the avionics platform on the forthcoming PiperJet (scheduled
      delivery 2010).

Garmin
      also introduced the GTX 328 Mode S transponder to meet the European regulation
      for Mode S implementation for VFR (visual flight rules) aircraft.

Expansion
      of Facilities

In
      April
      2007, Garmin’s United Kingdom subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd., completed its
      move into its new European headquarters facility in Totton, Southampton,
      England. This facility contains building space of approximately 155,000 sq.
      ft,
      including more than 129,000 sq. ft of warehouse space, which serves as Garmin’s
      European headquarters for distribution, marketing, and product support.


In
      June
      2007, Garmin’s Taiwan subsidiary acquired an approximate 580,000 sq. ft.
      facility in LinKou, Taiwan, which now serves as our third manufacturing facility
      for consumer products. The new LinKou facility brings the combined square
      footage of all Taiwan manufacturing facilities to approximately 1,090,000 sq.
      ft., and brings our current number of surface mount technology (SMT)
      manufacturing lines in Taiwan for consumer products to 36.

In
      October, 2007, Garmin International, Inc. broke ground on its 231,000 sq. ft.
      warehouse expansion at its headquarters facility in Olathe, Kansas, which is
      expected to be completed in March 2008. Garmin AT, Inc. is also in the midst
      of
      completing a large expansion to its manufacturing and aviation engineering
      facilities in Salem, Oregon, which will increase manufacturing and engineering
      spaces by 21,000 and 25,000 square feet (respectively). The Garmin AT, Inc.
      expansion is expected to be completed in July 2008.

Garmin
      also signed several new leases in 2007 to provide space for its call center
      operations and other satellite Garmin offices, the details of which are set
      forth in Part I, Item 2 below.

Acquisitions

In
      January 2007, Garmin acquired location-based services provider Digital Cyclone
      Inc. (DCI), located in Minnetonka, Minnesota, for $45 million in cash. DCI,
      which is operated as a subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., markets location-based
      services, including weather solutions for consumers, outdoor enthusiasts, and
      pilots on a subscription- based model in partnership with national wireless
      carriers and regional carriers.

In
      March
      2007, Garmin acquired substantially all of the assets of Nautamatic Marine
      Systems, Inc., a manufacturer of marine autopilot systems based in Newport,
      Oregon and Dania Beach, Florida.

Garmin
      acquired several of its European distributors in 2007 to strengthen its presence
      and capabilities in the European market. In January 2007, Garmin acquired EME
      Tec Sat SAS, the exclusive distributor of Garmin’s consumer products in France,
      which was renamed Garmin France SAS. In July 2007, Garmin acquired GPS
      Gesellschaft für Professionelle Satellitennavigation mbH, the exclusive

Research
      and Development

Garmin’s
      product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and
      development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and
      manufacturing teams. Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and
      development staff, which numbered

1,


people
      worldwide as of December 29, 2007. Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes
      manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers
      to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products.
      Garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software
      engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic
      engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played
      an
      important role in Garmin’s success. Once a development project is initiated and
      approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and
      transition it into manufacturing.

Manufacturing
      and Operations

Garmin
      believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability
      at
      its Shijr, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility,
      and its Salem, Oregon facility. Garmin believes that its vertically integrated
      approach has provided it the following benefits:

Reduced
      time-to-market.

Utilizing
      concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s products are introduced to
      production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by
      manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
      In
      this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product
      from
      its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and
      yields.

Design
      and process optimization.

Garmin
      uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products
      and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower cost and better
      value
      for customers. Garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and
      manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to
      minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and
      rugged.

Logistical
      agility.

Operating
      its own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as
      component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the
      electronics industry. Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component
      shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.
      Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a
      safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one
      product line to another.

Garmin’s
      design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan,
      and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001-2000, an international quality
      standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
      Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved TS 16949:2002
      certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. In addition,
      Garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality
      standard for the aviation industry.

In
      January 2007, Garmin’s Taiwan facilities also achieved certification of their
      environmental management systems to the ISO14001:1994 standard. This
      certification recognizes that Garmin’s Taiwan subsidiary has systems and
      processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment
      and
      to strive continually to improve its environmental performance. Garmin Europe
      and Garmin International, Inc. are currently pursuing compliance to the ISO
      14000 standard.

Materials

Garmin
      purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the
      world. For certain components, Garmin relies on sole source suppliers. The
      failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and
      in a
      timely manner could adversely affect our business.

Seasonality

Our
      sales
      are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products
      are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased
      demand for automotive/mobile products during the holiday buying season, and,
      to
      a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring
      and summer marine season and the Father’s Day/graduation buying season. Sales of
      consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new
      products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation,
      but
      are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the
      initial demand is typically the strongest.


Backlog

Our
      sales
      are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between
      order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
      material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders
      within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual
      Property

Our
      success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary
      technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
      secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect
      our
      proprietary rights. As of January 11, 2008, we held 331 U.S. patents and 42
      foreign patents. As of January 11, 2008, we had 190 U.S. patent applications
      and
      32 foreign patent applications pending. In addition, Garmin often relies on
      licenses of intellectual property for use in its business. For example, Garmin
      obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products
      from
      various sources. As of January 11, 2008, we held 81 U.S. trademark registrations
      and 162 foreign trademark registrations. As of January 11, 2008, we had 28
      U.S.
      trademark applications and 73 foreign trademark applications
      pending.

We
      believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our
      employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to
      file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect
      Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

Garmin
      was selected as a constituent of the Ocean Tomo® 300 Patent Index and The Ocean
      Tomo® 300 Patent Growth Index, which are indices that recognize companies with
      high intellectual property value.

There
      is
      no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire,
      may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also
      possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive
      advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing
      and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
      rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or
      to
      obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be
      necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect
      its trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
      of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The
      telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment
      in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with Federal
      Communication Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver and
      cellular handset products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable
      authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in
      Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European
      Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products,
      or
      enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing
      products could adversely affect our business. In addition, aviation products
      that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required
      to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation
      Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in
      an
      aircraft.

Because
      Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in
      Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect
      to
      remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations.
      The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provide
      that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
      to
      handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central
      Bank of China, also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor
      trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency
      earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used
      freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of
      merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign
      exchange banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan
      companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside
      and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million
      respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
      within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to
      be
      reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to remittances
      involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other
      foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of
      the
      limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate
      business reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also
      imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt
      with the CBC.


Environmental
      Matters

The
      European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain
      Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("RoHS
      Directive") and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE
      Directive”). The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws
      prohibiting the use of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium
      and
      hexavalent chromium, in certain electronic products put on the market after
      July
      1, 2006. The WEEE Directive requires EU member states to enact laws that were
      to
      go into effect by August 13, 2005 regulating the collection, recovery and
      recycling of waste from certain electronic products. We have established a
      program in order to comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted
      by
      the EU member states. We have modified the design of our products and our
      manufacturing processes in order to comply with such laws and regulations.

The
      EU
      has also enacted the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization of Chemicals
      (“REACH”) regulation.  REACH requires manufacturers and importers of
      articles to register the substances contained in the articles if the substances
      are intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions
      of
      use.  Because the substances contained in our products are not intended to
      be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, we do
      not
      believe we or the importers of our products have an obligation under REACH
      to
      register those substances.  It is possible, however, that Garmin could
      participate in the REACH regulations as necessary to support possible REACH
      registration requirements of the recyclers of our products.  REACH also
      imposes notification requirements on manufacturers and importers of articles
      if
      the articles contain “substances of very high concern.”  Although these
      notification requirements do not become effective until after June 1, 2011,
      we
      have established a program in order to comply with them when and to the extent
      necessary.

The
      People’s Republic of China has enacted legislation which is widely known as
“China RoHS”. The first phase of China RoHS took effect on March 1, 2007 and
      requires the disclosure and marking of certain substances, including lead,
      mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products. We
      have
      established a program in order to comply with the first phase of China
      RoHS.

The
      State
      of California has enacted legislation similar to the RoHS Directive and other
      states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the
      RoHS Directive and/or the WEEE Directive. The need for and cost of our
      compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but the cost could
      be
      substantial.

Several
      states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products
      and
      the labeling of mercury-containing products, including the member states of
      the
      Interstate Mercury Education and Reduction Clearinghouse (IMERC). Some of these
      laws, including those in Connecticut, New York, Vermont and Louisiana, are
      applicable to certain of Garmin’s GPS products. We have established an ongoing
      compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling
      requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation.

Portable
      Garmin products which use AC/DC adapters as an option for battery charging
      would
      require submissions of energy-use profiles if and when the future implementing
      measures resulting from the EU EuP (Energy Using Products) Directive define
      such
      products as being within their scope.


Employees

As
      of
      December 31, 2007, Garmin had 8,434

full-time
      employees worldwide, of whom 2,443 were in the United States, 67 were in Canada,
      5,444 were in Taiwan, 475 were in Europe, and 5 were in other global locations.
      None of Garmin’s  employees are represented by a labor union (except for
      Garmin’s four employees in Brazil) and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan
      employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers
      its
      employee relations to be good.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

The
      risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
      risks
      and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to
      be
      immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
      risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be
      materially adversely affected.

Risks
      Related to the Company

Many
      of our Products Rely on the Global Positioning System

The
      Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system
      consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their
      ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United
      States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently
      charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their
      ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic
      and
      mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally
      designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile
      space environment in which they operate. However, of the current deployment
      of
      satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 13 years.

If
      a
      significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or
      are
      not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning
      System products and would have a material negative effect on our business.
      In
      addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain
      committed to the operation and maintenance of Global Positioning System
      satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government
      that
      provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge and without
      accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing commercial
      applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies
      may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of Global
      Positioning System signals. However, in a presidential policy statement issued
      in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. is committed
      to supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will continue
      providing it free from direct user fees.

Some
      of
      our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide
      Area Augmentation System (WAAS). WAAS is operated by the FAA. Any curtailment
      of
      the operating capability of WAAS could result in decreased user capability
      for
      many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.

Any
      of
      the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products
      to
      select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on
      competing technologies.

A
      shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation
      would harm our business.

Following
      the

September
      11, 2001

terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be
      grounded for several days. In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace,
      the
      general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions
      implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules
      (VFR). The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile
      radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.
      The
      Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions
      affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports
      inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas. The AOPA estimates that
      approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that
      only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument
      Flight Rules (IFR).


The
      shut
      down of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of
      our
      general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products
      manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility
      in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and
      existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any
      future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general
      aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
      results.

Any
      reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the
      reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm
      our
      business.

Our
      Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard
      Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning
      System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency
      bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
      The
      assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known
      as
      the International Telecommunications Union (‘‘ITU’’). The Federal Communications
      Commission (‘‘FCC’’) is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for
      non-government use in the United States in accordance with ITU regulations.
      Any
      ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band
      segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception
      of Global Positioning System signals and may materially and adversely affect
      the
      utility and reliability of our products, which would, in turn, have a material
      adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, emissions from mobile
      satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands
      or
      inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our
      products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating
      results. The FCC continually receives proposals for new technologies and
      services, such as ultra-wideband technologies, which may seek to operate in,
      or
      across, the radio frequency bands currently used by the GPS SPS. Adverse
      decisions by the FCC that result in harmful interference to the delivery of
      the
      GPS SPS may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of
      our
      products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and
      financial condition.

If
      we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely
      manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We
      expect
      that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived
      from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products is
      characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and
      changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify
      or
      improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry
      standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive
      or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and
      development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing
      products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However, there can
      be
      no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed
      or,
      if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If
      we are
      unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and
      enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be
      adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial
      time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to
      technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that
      we
      can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain
      on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies
      as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products
      are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve
      timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability
      of
      these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to
      our
      future success. From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain
      of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development
      delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory
      approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results
      of
      operations.


If
      we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able
      to
      secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or
      we
      could have costly excess production or inventories.

Historically,
      we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we
      did
      experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to
      declining economic conditions and the shut down of U.S. airspace as a result
      of
      the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. We have generally
      been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. However, the
      demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to
      forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as
      we
      introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our
      products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to
      the
      mass market category. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could
      cause the following problems in our operations:

·

If
                demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly
                increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional
                volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase
                production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.

·

Rapid
                increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could
                result
                in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other
                expenses. These higher costs could lower our profit margins. Further,
                if
                production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline,
                which may also lower our margins and reduce customer
                satisfaction.

·

If
                forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production
                resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components,
                which
                would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the
                excess
                inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess
                manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our
                facilities, which could result in lower margins.

We
      may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If
      our
      aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions
      or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
      Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could
      cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
      If
      our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping
      supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings
      about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur
      resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events
      occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and
      property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment
      for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against accident-related risks
      involving our products. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance
      would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such
      insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In
      addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages
      and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which
      could result in lower margins. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance
      to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover
      the
      award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial
      condition and results of operations.

We
      depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific
      components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers
      are
      not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if
      the
      costs of components rise.

We
      are
      dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current
      products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers
      include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays,
      memory chips, batteries and microprocessors. The cost, quality and availability
      of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our
      products. Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain
      application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs
      are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not
      be
      currently available for these sole source components.


In
      the
      past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other
      components. In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the
      costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand
      for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative
      source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the
      costs
      of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production
      of our products would be seriously harmed.

We
      depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our
      automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be
      harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the
      royalty costs for such data rise.

We
      license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.
      There
      are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical
      region. The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele
      Atlas N.V. Nokia has signed a Merger Agreement with NAVTEQ, and such Merger
      Agreement has been approved by NAVTEQ’s shareholders. As of February 21, 2008,
      the proposed merger between Nokia and NAVTEQ is currently pending regulatory
      review by the European Commission and other closing conditions. In addition,
      Tom
      Tom, one of our main competitors in the PND market, is in the process of
      attempting to acquire Tele Atlas through an offer to purchase all of the issued
      ordinary shares of Tele Atlas. As of February 22, 2008, Tom Tom’s proposed offer
      to purchase the Tele Atlas shares was under regulatory review by the European
      Commission.

If
      both
      of these transactions close, the two largest digital map suppliers will become
      wholly-owned subsidiaries of Garmin competitors. Although we do not foresee
      difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long
      term extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending
      our
      NAVTEQ agreement through 2015 with an option to extend through 2019), if we
      are
      unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an
      alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with NAVTEQ or Tele
      Atlas change detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our
      products would be seriously harmed.

We
      rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and
      disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because
      we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors,
      we
      are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels
      and
      support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain
      significant levels of our products in their inventories. If dealers and
      distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not
      maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be
      negatively impacted.

Many
      of
      our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
      If
      our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those
      dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
      In
      the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of
      qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful
      relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution
      channels, our business will suffer.

Failure
      to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our
      business.

Our
      ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan
      in a
      rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process.
      We continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and
      internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially. This
      growth has placed, and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue
      to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources.


Our
      business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified
      personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our
      future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key
      executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative
      personnel. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key
      executive officers. We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key
      executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The
      loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key
      employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled
      personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.
      For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of
      qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for
      us
      to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been
      challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified
      employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

Gross
      margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Gross
      margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining due to price
      reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation
      devices (PNDs). We expect that gross margins on automotive/mobile products
      will
      continue to erode. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from
      period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition
      and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific
      product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we
      intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield
      improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
      products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features
      and
      therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can
      be no
      assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost
      reductions or introduce any such new products in the future. To the extent
      that
      such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely
      manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial
      condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
      affected.

Our
      quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality and
      may
      be negatively affected by weakness in the economy.

Our
      operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating
      results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline, the
      price of our stock would likely decline. As we expand our operations, our
      operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development
      costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales. If revenues decrease and
      we
      are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be
      negatively affected.

Historically,
      our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each
      fiscal year and have, from time to time, been lower than the preceding quarter.
      Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally
      lower in these quarters. Sales of certain of our marine and
      automotive

products
      tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer
      spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel
      season. Sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our
      fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic
      devices during the holiday season.

In
      addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with
      relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters,
      which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Since
      our
      products are highly consumer-oriented, a significant slowdown in discretionary
      spending or consumer confidence due to an economic recession or slowdown in
      the
      United States or worldwide economies could negatively impact our
      revenues.

Adverse
      economic conditions may harm our investments.

Inflation
      or other changes in general economic conditions could adversely affect our
      investment portfolio.


Our
      quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency
      translation.

Our
      Taiwan subsidiary holds, and is expected to continue to hold significant cash,
      cash equivalents, and marketable securities and receivables denominated in
      U.S.
      Dollars. Because the U.S. Dollar is the primary currency for our business and
      in
      order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in
      the
      exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar and the New Taiwan Dollar on these assets,
      management expects that the Taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority
      of these assets in U.S. Dollar or U.S. Dollar denominated instruments.
      Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period
      to translate into New Taiwan dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets
      held by our Taiwan subsidiary. This translation is required because the New
      Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. This U.S.
      GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our
      financial statements as the New Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
      Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. Because
      there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management
      will continue to focus on the Company’s operating performance before the impact
      of the foreign currency translation.

If
      we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our
      resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer
      customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The
      markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition
      to
      increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater
      financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors
      may
      be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes
      in
      customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to
      the
      development, promotion and sale of their products. Increased competition could
      result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss
      of
      market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future
      competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results
      of operations.

Our
      intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could
      suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by
      others.

We
      rely
      on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,
      confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
      our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents
      and
      registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect
      our
      rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that
      our
      patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark
      applications will become registered trademarks. Moreover, even if approved,
      our
      patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or
      otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. Thus, any patents or
      trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a
      significant competitive advantage.

Third
      parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
      Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
      condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of
      patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Litigation concerning
      patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. We may
      seek
      licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or
      demand commercially unreasonable terms. We might not have sufficient resources
      to pay for the licenses. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur
      substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical
      technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.

Failure
      to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm
      our business.

We
      have
      certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to
      governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
      FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended
      for installation in type certificated aircraft. To the extent required,
      certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires
      significant focus and resources. An inability to obtain, or excessive delay
      in
      obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability
      to
      introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’
ability to sell airplanes. Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely
      affect our operating results.

In
      addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be
      decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our
      operating results.


Our
      business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with
      international sales and operations.

Our
      business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
      We
      estimate that approximately 39% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended
      December 29, 2007 represented products shipped to international destinations.
      Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
      be harmed by a variety of international factors, including:

·

changes
                in foreign currency exchange rates;

·

changes
                in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions,
                particularly in emerging markets;

·

trade
                protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

·

potentially
                negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

·

difficulty
                in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations;

·

acts
                of war, terrorism, or political unrest; and

·

less
                effective protection of intellectual property.

We
      may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies
      that operate in Taiwan.

Relations
      between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC,
      and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan
      in
      the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
      and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
      Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products,
      except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan
      has a unique international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty over
      all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
      The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
      Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established
      during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated
      that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain
      circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. Relations
      between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value
      of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan
      in
      the future.

There
      is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil
      liabilities in the Cayman Islands and Taiwan.

We
      are a
      Cayman Islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located
      outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be
      difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In
      addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands
      or
      Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained
      against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities
      laws
      of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original
      actions brought in the Cayman Islands or Taiwan against us predicated upon
      the
      securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


Our
      shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we
      are
      incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our
      corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association,
      as
      amended, and by the Companies Law (2007 Revision) and the common law of the
      Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
      responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly
      established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
      jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty
      in
      protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management, directors
      or
      our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation
      incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively
      less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike
      many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not
      specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or
      consolidation of a company. This may make it more difficult for you to assess
      the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation
      or
      to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe
      the
      consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders
      of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as Garmin have no general rights
      under
      Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies
      of lists of shareholders of the company. This may make it more difficult for
      you
      to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a
      shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection
      with a proxy contest.

Subject
      to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may
      not
      bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands
      counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or
      derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.

We
      may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other
      ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully
      identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We
      intend
      to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments
      in
      complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into
      strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets,
      additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing
      synergies or additional industry expertise. In 2007, we acquired Digital
      Cyclone, Inc., EME TecSat SAS, Gesellschaft für Professionelle
      Satellitennavigation mbH, Synergy S.p.A, Electrónica Trepat S.A. and the assets
      of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc., We may not be able to identify suitable
      acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do
      identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete
      those
      transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any
      past
      or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired
      employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions),
      operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention
      away from other business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired
      companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and
      inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired
      company may decide not to work for us. Our management has had limited experience
      in assimilating acquired organizations and products into our operations. We
      may
      not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the
      Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations,
      personnel or products related to acquisitions we made in 2007 or may make in
      the
      future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business
      could be materially harmed.

We
      have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on
      certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our
      effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, because we
      have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology
      investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant
      effect on our financial results in the future.


Changes
      in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax
      law
      could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We
      do not
      believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently
      a
‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for United States federal income tax
      purposes. We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
      However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made
      annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control
      and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company
      tests are not entirely clear, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive
      foreign investment company. If we are a passive foreign investment company
      in
      any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could
      be
      liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon
      some
      distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
      Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any
      year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will
      continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect
      to
      such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue
      to
      satisfy the income or asset tests described above. Additional tax considerations
      would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign
      corporation.

We
      may have additional tax liabilities.

We
      are
      subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign
      jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
      provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
      many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
      uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe
      our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and
      any
      related litigation could be materially different from our historical income
      tax
      provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a
      material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the
      period or periods for which that determination is made.

Risks
      Relating to Our Shares

The
      volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common
      shares.

The
      market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly
      volatile. During 2007, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of 
$48.46 to a high of $125.68. A variety of factors could cause the price of
      our
      common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

announcements
                and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors,
                our
                suppliers or the markets in which we
                compete;

·

quarterly
                fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating
                results;

·

the
                availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such
                as
                flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our
                products;

·

general
                conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest
                rates;

·

announcements
                of technological innovations;

·

new
                products or product enhancements by us or our
                competitors;

·

product
                obsolescence and our ability to manage product
                transitions;

·

developments
                in patents or other intellectual property rights and
                litigation;

·

developments
                in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

·

research
                reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses
                related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers;
                and

·

any
                significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or
                significant markets where we sell our
                products.

In
      addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares
      of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
      fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of
      affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect
      the market price of our common shares, and the market price of our common shares
      may decline.


Our
      officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As
      of
      February 15, 2008 members and former members of our Board of Directors and
      our
      executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that
      may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially
      owned approximately 40% of our outstanding common shares

.
      Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of
      corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and
      acquisitions. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying,
      deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect
      the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.

Provisions
      in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter, delay
      or
      prevent a third party from acquiring us and Cayman Islands corporate law may
      impede a takeover, which could decrease the value of our shares.

Our
      Board
      of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 preferred shares and
      to
      determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
      voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the
      shareholders. This could have an adverse impact on the market price of our
      common shares. We have no present plans to issue any preferred shares, but
      we
      may do so. The rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to, and
      adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that
      may be issued in the future. In addition, we have adopted a classified board
      of
      directors. Our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire
      board of directors without a super majority vote. In addition, a super majority
      vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders.
      Shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting. We have
      adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would
      significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us
      without prior approval of our Board of Directors. This shareholders’ rights plan
      and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for
      a
      third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders.

Unlike
      many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not currently
      provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in
      the
      United States. While Cayman Islands law does have statutory provisions that
      provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are commonly
      referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement,” the procedural
      and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more
      rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required
      to
      consummate a merger in the United States. Under Cayman Islands law and practice,
      a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands exempted company
      must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s
      shareholders who are present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at such
      meeting. The shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also
      represent at least 75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders
      (excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement) present
      and voting at the meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also
      sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation.
      Although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the
      parties involved in the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks
      to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities
      to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise
      materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand
      Court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

·

the
                statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

·

the
                shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

·

the
                scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve;
                and

·

the
                scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned
                under some other

provision
                of the Companies Law.

      Britannica, Inc. v. Alpine Electronics of America, Inc., Alpine Electronics,
      Inc., Denso Corporation, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., American Honda Motor
      Co., Inc., and Garmin International, Inc.

On
      May
      16, 2005, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. (“Encyclopaedia Britannica”) filed suit
      in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin
      Division, against Garmin’s wholly owned subsidiary Garmin International, Inc.
      (“Garmin International”) and five other unrelated companies, alleging
      infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,241,671 (“the ‘671 patent”). Garmin
      International believes that it should not be found liable for infringement
      of
      the ‘671 patent and additionally that the ‘671 patent is invalid. On December
      30, 2005, Garmin International filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for Claim
      Invalidity Based on Indefiniteness. On March 1, 2006 the court held a hearing
      on
      construction of the claims of the ‘671 patent. The parties await the court’s
      ruling on Garmin’s summary judgment motion and the court’s claim construction
      order. On May 23, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed an amended complaint
      claiming that Garmin International and the other defendants also infringe U.S.
      Patent No. 7,051,018 (“the ‘018 patent”), a continuation patent of the ‘671
      patent, which issued on May 23, 2006. Garmin International believes that it
      should not be found liable for infringement of the ‘018 patent and additionally
      that the ‘018 patent is invalid. On July 25, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica
      filed a new complaint claiming that Garmin International and the other
      defendants also infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,082,437 (“the ‘437 patent”), a
      continuation patent of the ‘671 patent, which issued on July 25, 2006. Garmin
      International believes that it should not be found liable for infringement
      of
      the ‘437 patent and additionally that the ‘437 patent is invalid. Encyclopaedia
      Britannica has asserted the ’018 and ’437 patents against other parties in
      Encyclopaedia Britannica v. Magellan Navigation, Inc., et al., Case No.
      07-CA-787 (LY)(W.D. Tex). On October 5, 2007, the defendants in that case filed
      a Motion for Summary Judgment of Invalidity of the ’018 and ’437 patents and the
      parties await a hearing and/or the court’s ruling on that motion. Although there
      can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not
      have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
      position, Garmin International believes that the claims are without merit and
      intends to vigorously defend these actions

.

Mobile
      Traffic Systems Corporation and TrafficGauge, Inc. v. Cobra Electronics Corp.,
      Garmin USA, Inc., Magellan Navigation, Inc., and TomTom, Inc.

On
      April
      11, 2007, Mobile Traffic Systems Corporation filed a lawsuit in the United
      States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama claiming that certain
      products of Garmin and the other defendants infringe U.S. Patents Nos. 7,069,143
      and 6,728,628 (the “Asserted Patents”). TrafficGauge, Inc. was subsequently
      added as a co-plaintiff. On August 20, 2007, along with its initial answer,
      Garmin USA, Inc. filed counterclaims seeking judgments declaring the Asserted
      Patents to be invalid and not infringed. On December 21, 2007, after the initial
      discovery phase had progressed, Garmin USA, Inc. amended its answer and filed
      an
      additional counterclaim seeking a judgment declaring the Asserted Patents to
      be
      unenforceable based on the inventor’s inequitable conduct before the United
      States Patent Office during prosecution of the Asserted Patents. In January
      Cobra Electronics Corp. announced that it had settled this lawsuit on
      undisclosed terms. The court has scheduled trial against the remaining
      defendants to begin on November 17, 2008. Although there can be no assurance
      that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse
      effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin USA,
      Inc. believes that it should not be found liable for infringement of the
      Asserted Patents and additionally that the Asserted Patents are invalid and
      unenforceable.


From
      time
      to time Garmin is involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
      of our business. We believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will
      not
      have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
      of operations.

Overview

We
      are a
      leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
      devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
      technology. We operate in four business segments, which serve the marine,
      outdoor/fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets. Our segments offer
      products through our network of independent dealers and distributors. However,
      the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary
      significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. Our portable GPS
      receivers and accessories for marine, recreation/fitness and automotive/mobile
      segments are sold primarily to retail outlets. Our aviation products are
      portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight
      Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft
      manufacturers.

Since
      our
      first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from
      operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits. Our sales
      have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 54% since 2003 and our
      net
      income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 48% since 2003.
      The
      vast majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of
      new
      revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies,
      Inc. in 2003, MotionBased Technologies LLC in 2005, Dynastream Innovations
      Inc.
      in 2006, Digital Cyclone, Inc. and the assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems,
      Inc.
      in 2007, and four European distributors in 2007 - Garmin France SAS, Garmin
      Deutschland GmbH, Garmin Iberia S.A., and Garmin Italia S.p.A.; these
      acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those
      years.

Since
      our
      principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience
      some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results. The functional
      currency of our European operations is the Euro (effective July 2007) and the
      functional currency of our Asian operations is the New Taiwan Dollar.
      Approximately 80 percent of transactions of our European operations are now
      denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro. We experienced $23.0
      million, $0.6 million, $15.3 million, ($24.8) million, and ($6.7) million in
      foreign currency gains (losses) during fiscal years 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004,
      and
      2003, respectively. To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions
      with
      the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian dollar, or the New Taiwan
      Dollar, although we may utilize hedging transactions in the future.


Critical
      Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s
      discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
      are
      based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
      in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States. The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make
      estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
      revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
      liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including
      those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad
      debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty
      obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates on
      historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
      be
      reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
      making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are
      not
      readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
      estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue
      Recognition

Garmin
      records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns
      and
      incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts
      offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories
      in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based
      incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments
      using
      historical experience and expectation of future conditions. Changes in these
      estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results. These incentives
      are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection, are
      accrued for on a percentage of sales basis. If market conditions were to
      decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings
      possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the
      incentive is offered.

Warranties

Garmin’s
      products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from
      one
      to two years. Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide
      warranty services. Garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
      obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future
      conditions. To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity
      or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual
      will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.

Inventory

Garmin
      writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory
      equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
      value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If
      actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management,
      additional inventory write-downs may be required.


Investments

Investments
      are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized
      investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity. Investment
      income is recorded when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized
      when
      investments are sold. Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if
      they
      have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
      If
      investments are determined to be impaired, a capital loss is recognized at
      the
      date of determination.

Testing
      for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment.
      The
      identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their
      fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than
      temporary are the key judgment elements. The discovery of new information and
      the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of
      impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any
      resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
      and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining
      fair
      value and assessing investment impairment.

Income
      Taxes

Garmin
      provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between
      the
      tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial
      reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will
      be in
      effect when the differences are expected to reverse. While no valuation
      allowance has been recorded, it is Garmin’s policy to record a valuation
      allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is
      more likely than not to be realized. While Garmin has considered future taxable
      income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
      the
      need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that
      it
      would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in
      the
      future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income
      in
      the period such determination was made. Likewise, should Garmin determine that
      it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess
      of
      its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase
      income in the period such determination was made.

In
      addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
      uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
      liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based
      on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will
      be
      due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the
      reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in
      the
      period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our
      estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment,
      a
      further charge to expense would result.

Stock
      Based Compensation

Garmin
      distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) each year as
      part of Garmin’s compensation package for employees. Employees with certain
      levels of responsibility within Garmin are eligible for stock option or SAR
      grants, but the granting of options or SARs is at the discretion of the
      Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual
      obligation. Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 10 of
      the
      Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting
      Terms and Characteristics

Net
      Sales

Our
      net
      sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor
      network and to original equipment manufacturers. We recognize sales when title
      of the products passes to the customer. Our sales are largely of a consumer
      nature; therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future
      sales results. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and
      we
      typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net
      sales
      are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer
      products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during
      the
      spring and summer marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased
      demand during the holiday buying season. Our aviation products do not experience
      much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release
      of
      new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.


Gross
      Profit

Raw
      material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. In
      the
      first half of 2007, we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing,
      which allowed us to hold margins in our automotive/mobile segment steady; margin
      declines in the second half of 2007 were primarily a result of average selling
      price declines, coupled with raw materials price increases, most notably the
      costs for flash memory, in late second quarter and through the third quarter
      of
      2007 when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs,
      resulting in margin declines as these components were sold, primarily in the
      fourth quarter of 2007. In the first half of 2006, we experienced meaningful
      price declines on flash memory and color screens, which allowed us to hold
      margins in our automotive/mobile segment steady in the face of price declines,
      and allowed us to improve margins in other business segments as well. While
      these price declines did not continue throughout all of 2006, we did have
      additional component cost reductions as we neared year end. In 2005 we
      experienced a shift in product mix to lower-margin product groups, which
      continued in 2006, and price declines related to increased competition, both
      in
      relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation product line.

Our
      existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
      in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from
      different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit
      us
      to use these lower cost components. We believe that because of our practice
      of
      performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house,
      our
      Shijr, Taiwan, Jhongli, Taiwan, Lin-Kou, Taiwan, Olathe, Kansas, and Salem,
      Oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of
      manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest
      volume products. Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower
      in
      Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales
      price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross
      profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile
      market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products
      sold at lower price points. The average selling prices of our aviation products
      have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products
      sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales price variability inherent within
      the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our
      gross profit.

Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses

Our
      selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries
                for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries
                and related costs for executives and administrative
                personnel;

·

advertising,
                marketing, and other brand building
                costs;

·

accounting
                and legal costs;

·

information
                systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel
                and related costs; and

·

occupancy
                and other overhead costs.

With
      the
      expected increase of total revenues in the future, we expect selling, general
      and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
      We intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus
      on
      individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer
      marketplace, especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand
      opportunities in rapidly growing markets like portable automobile navigation,
      which is becoming a mass market. We also intend to increase our customer call
      center support as our business continues to grow. We also anticipate increased
      selling, general, and administrative costs associated with information
      technology staffing and support activities.


Research
      and Development

The
      majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our
      engineers, costs for high technology components used in product and prototype
      development, and costs of test equipment needed during product development.
      Approximately 87% of the research and development of our products is performed
      in the United States. The remainder of our research and development activities
      are performed by our Taiwan engineering group, which has increased in size
      in
      recent years.

We
      are
      committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new
      products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and
      aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices. We continue
      to
      grow our research and development budget in absolute terms.

Customers

No
      customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in the year ended December
      29,
      2007. Our top ten customers have contributed between 25% and 41% of net sales
      since 2002. We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts
      receivable of between 38 and 62 days since 2002. We have experienced an increase
      in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product
      mix
      and longer payment terms, and anticipate maintaining approximately the current
      level of accounts receivable days going forward.

Income
      Taxes

We
      have
      experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion
      of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory
      rates. In particular, lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives
      offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital
      investments, and other Taiwan tax credits due to repatriation of 2007 earnings
      have continued to reduce our tax rate there. Therefore, profits earned in Taiwan
      have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the United States and Europe.
      As a
      result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 12.6% during
      2007.
      We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and
      we
      expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through
      2012. The current Taiwan tax incentives for which Garmin has received approval
      will end in 2012. We plan on applying for additional incentives for years beyond
      2012 based on capital investments we expect to make in the future. However,
      there can be no assurance that such tax incentives will be available
      indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which we apply.
      Management also believes that the revenue shift to our lower-tax rate corporate
      entities will continue, however certain tax credits will not be available in
      2008, so the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be slightly
      higher than fiscal 2007. The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon
      the production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2008,
      and the composition of our earnings.

The
      increase in total net sales during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the
      introduction of over 60 new products and overall demand for our automotive
      products. The aviation, marine, and outdoor/fitness segments also experienced
      solid growth in 2007. Total units sold increased 128% to 12,300,000 in 2007
      from
      5,400,000 in 2006. In general, management believes that continuous innovation
      and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue
      growth.

The
      increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of
      many
      new automotive, outdoor/fitness, and marine products, strong demand for our
      automotive products, and solid demand for our aviation, marine, and
      outdoor/fitness products. It is management’s belief that the continued demand
      for the Company’s automotive products is due to overall increased consumer
      awareness of the capabilities and applications of GPS, particularly as those
      capabilities pertain to automobile navigation. Additionally, the expansion
      of
      the GPS market in general, as well as enhanced feature sets in our products
      specifically, have added to our growth. Innovative new product offerings,
      enhanced cartography, rich feature sets, and products featuring high sensitivity
      GPS capabilities increased sales of our marine and outdoor fitness segments.
      The
      increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased sales
      from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers)
      and retrofit markets. Sales of the G1000 integrated glass cockpit were the
      primary reason for increased OEM sales in 2006. While Temporary Flight
      Restrictions (TFR's) continue to impact general aviation, the flying community
      is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers.
      Should the FAA impose more restrictions, or elect to shutdown U.S. airspace
      in
      the future, these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business.

The
      increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction
      of over 60 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoor/fitness
      products. The reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the
      strong growth experienced in our lower-margin automotive/mobile product line,
      offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments.
      Notably gross margin in our automotive/mobile segment did not fall as much
      as
      anticipated due to volume discounts on certain components, less price
      competition than anticipated, and new “premium” feature-rich products with
      higher selling prices and margins. Management believes that the trend to lower
      gross margin percentages will continue in the future as net sales of automotive
      products increase at a faster rate than the other business segments. The rise
      in
      aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift in product mix within our
      OEM
      and retrofit products. The decline in gross margin in the outdoor/fitness and
      marine segments was primarily due to a shift in product mix.

The
      increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment
      generally across the organization, significantly increased advertising costs
      (up
      80%) associated primarily with mass-market advertising to increase brand
      awareness and promote our automotive products, increased information technology
      staffing and support costs, increased staffing in our sales and marketing group
      to increase focus on specific target markets, and additional staffing in our
      customer call center. Management expects that because of strong demand for
      our
      products, selling, general and administrative expenses will rise in absolute
      dollars but decline as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2008 as increased
      advertising and marketing activities build awareness of the Garmin brand and
      demand for Garmin products worldwide.

The
      increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to
      the
      addition of over 400 associates to our research and development team during
      fiscal 2007. Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives
      for
      future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development,
      and
      introduction of new products. Management expects that its research and
      development expenses will increase approximately 30%-35% during fiscal 2008
      on
      an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong
      portfolio of new products slated for fiscal 2008. Management expects to continue
      to invest in the research and development of new products and technology in
      order to maintain Garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it
      competes.

Other
      income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense
      and
      foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was higher
      in
      fiscal 2007 relative to fiscal 2006, with the majority of this difference caused
      by increased interest income and a large foreign currency gain in 2007. Interest
      income for fiscal 2007 increased due to higher interest rates and larger cash
      and marketable securities balances during the year, increasing the returns
      on
      the Company’s cash and cash equivalents.

Foreign
      currency gains and losses for the Company in 2007 were primarily tied to
      movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling. The
      U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd. The Euro
      Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin France, Garmin Deutschland, Garmin
      Iberia, and Garmin Italia. As these entities grow, Euro currency moves will
      generate material gains and losses. Additionally, Euro-based inter-company
      transactions between Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries can also generate currency
      gains and losses. The Canadian dollar is the functional currency of Dynastream
      Innovations, Inc.; due to this entity’s relative size, its currency moves do not
      have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.


The
      majority of the $23.0 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the
      weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound
      Sterling. During fiscal 2007, the Taiwan Dollar weakened relative to the U.S.
      Dollar, resulting in a $2.5 million loss. The British Pound Sterling and the
      Euro strengthened 2% and 11.4% respectively, relative to the U.S. Dollar during
      fiscal 2007, which resulted in a $25.6 million gain. Other net currency gains
      and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of $0.1
      million.

Foreign
      currency gains and losses for the Company in 2006 were primarily tied to
      movements by the Taiwan Dollar and the British Pound Sterling relative to the
      U.S. Dollar. The U.S. dollar weakened when compared to the Taiwan Dollar during
      fiscal 2006, creating a $3.0 million loss, which was offset almost entirely
      by a
      $4.5 million gain as a result of strengthening in the U.S. Dollar relative
      to
      the British Pound Sterling. Other net currency gains and the timing of
      transactions created the remaining loss of $0.9 million.

Income
      Tax Provision

Income
      tax expense increased by $42.9 million, to $123.3 million, for fiscal year
      from $80.4 million for fiscal year 2006, due to our higher taxable income.
      The
      effective tax rate was 12.6% for fiscal 2007 versus 13.5% for fiscal 2006.
      The
      decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan
      as a
      result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
      in
      Taiwan, tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our
      Taiwan earnings to our parent company, and the increased contribution to our
      income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2007 relative to 2006. This lower
      effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a
      percentage of revenue of approximately 0.7% from fiscal 2006 to fiscal
      2007.

Net
      Income

As
      a
      result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 66% to $855.0
      million for fiscal year 2007 compared to $514.1 million for fiscal year
      2006.

The
      increase in total net sales during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the
      introduction of over 70 new products and overall demand for our automotive
      and
      outdoor/fitness products. Total units sold increased 78% to 5,400,000 in 2006
      from 3,028,000 in 2005.

Garmin’s
      revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth quarter
      revenues being meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters.
      In
      2006 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern, with increases each
      quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases
      across all product lines. The revenue increase in the second quarter was
      primarily attributable to sell-in of popular new portable automobile navigation
      and outdoor/fitness products and Father’s Day/graduation purchases. The revenue
      increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to late summer new
      product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling
      season.

The
      increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction of
      many
      new automotive, outdoor/fitness, and marine products and overall demand for
      our
      automotive and outdoor/fitness products. It is management’s belief that the
      continued demand for the Company’s automotive products is due to overall
      increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of GPS,
      particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation.
      Additionally, the expansion of the GPS market in general, as well as enhanced
      feature sets in our products specifically, have added to our growth. The
      increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased sales
      from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers)
      and retrofit markets. Sales of the G1000 integrated glass cockpit were the
      primary reason for increased OEM sales in 2006.

The

increase
      in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction of over
      70 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoor/fitness
      products. The reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the
      strong growth experienced in our lower-margin automotive/mobile product line,
      offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments.
      Notably gross margin in our automotive/mobile segment did not fall as much
      as
      anticipated due to better than anticipated raw material cost reductions, volume
      discounts on certain components, less price competition than anticipated, and
      new “premium” feature-rich products with higher selling prices and margins.
      Management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will
      continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a faster
      rate than the other business segments. The decline in aviation gross margin
      was
      primarily due to a shift in product mix within our OEM and retrofit products
      and
      the delay of some anticipated OEM and retrofit products.

The
      increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to
      the
      addition of over 250 associates to our research and development team during
      fiscal 2006. A key strategic initiative for future growth and success of Garmin
      is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products, which
      was facilitated by these additions to research and development staff.

      income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense
      and
      foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was higher
      in
      fiscal 2006 relative to fiscal 2005, with the majority of this difference caused
      by increased interest income in 2006. Interest income for fiscal 2006 increased
      due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances
      during the year, increasing the returns on the Company’s cash and cash
      equivalents.

During
      fiscal 2006, the Company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of $0.6
      million, although the U.S. Dollar weakened slightly versus the Taiwan Dollar
      and
      British Pound ($32.60 TD/USD and $0.51 GBP/USD) relative to the end of fiscal
      2005 ($32.84 TD/USD and $0.58 GBP/USD). During fiscal 2005, the Company
      experienced foreign currency exchange gains of $15.3 million, as the U.S. Dollar
      strengthened versus the Taiwan Dollar and British Pound ($32.84 TD/USD and
      $0.58
      GBP/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2004 (32.19 TD/USD and $0.52
      GBP/USD).


Income
      Tax Provision

Income
      tax expense increased by $19.0 million, to $80.4 million, for fiscal year 2006
      from $61.4 million for fiscal year 2005, due to our higher taxable income.
      The
      effective tax rate was 13.5% for fiscal 2006 versus 16.5% for fiscal 2005.
      The
      decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan
      as a
      result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
      in
      Taiwan, tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of our
      Taiwan earnings to our parent company, and the increased contribution to our
      income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2006 relative to 2005. This lower
      effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a
      percentage of revenue of approximately 1.4% from fiscal 2005 to fiscal
      2006.

Net
      Income

As
      a
      result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 65% to $514.1
      million for fiscal year 2006 compared to $311.2 million for fiscal year
      2005.

Liquidity
      and Capital Resources

Net
      cash
      generated by operations was $682.1 million, $361.9 million, and $247.0 million
      for fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. We operate with a
      customer-oriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet
      customer demand. Because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and
      minimize order fulfillment time, our inventory levels are generally substantial
      enough to meet most demand. We also attempt to carry sufficient inventory levels
      of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an impact
      as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products. We began
      implementing a more linear inventory management strategy in the fourth quarter
      of 2007 which management would anticipate will result in less inventory
      fluctuation from quarter to quarter going forward. We prefer to have sufficient
      finished goods on hand to meet anticipated demand for our products. Raw
      materials and finished goods inventory levels continued to grow year over year
      as a function of our growing sales. We anticipate days of inventory to stabilize
      at current levels in 2008 although absolute dollars of inventory will continue
      to rise, reflecting the growth of our business.

Capital
      expenditures in 2007 totaled $156.8 million, an increase of $63.9 million from
      fiscal 2006. This amount in 2007 reflects the purchase and build-out of an
      additional manufacturing facility in Lin-Kou, Taiwan, continued expansion of
      research and development facilities in our Taiwan facilities, as well as
      ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2007. Capital expenditures in 2006
      totaled $92.9 million, an increase of $65.8 million from fiscal 2005. This
      amount in 2006 reflects the purchase and renovation of an additional
      manufacturing facility in Jhongli, Taiwan, the purchase of a new European
      headquarters, as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal 2006. Capital
      expenditures in 2005 totaled $27.1 million, a decrease of $51.0 million from
      fiscal 2004.

We
      have
      budgeted approximately $115 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2008
      to include normal ongoing capital expenditures as well as purchases of
      production machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the Lin-Kou, Taiwan
      facility.

In
      addition to capital expenditures, in 2007 cash flow used in investing related
      to
      the purchase of Digital Cyclone, Inc., Garmin France SAS, Garmin Deutschland
      GmbH, Garmin Iberia S.A., Garmin Italia S.p.A., and the assets of Nautamatic
      Marine Systems, Inc. for a total of $128.8 million, the net sale of $112.8
      million of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our on-hand
      cash balances and the purchase of $2.9 million of intangible assets. Garmin’s
      average return on its investments during fiscal 2007 was approximately 4.3%.
      In
      addition to capital expenditures, in 2006 cash flow used in investing related
      to
      the purchase of Dynastream Innovations, Inc. for $36.5 million, the net purchase
      of $93.8 million of fixed income securities associated with the investment
      of
      our on-hand cash balances and the purchase of $3.1 million of intangible assets.
      Garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal 2006 was approximately
      4.7%. In addition to capital expenditures, in 2005 cash flow used in investing
      related to the net purchase of $59.1 million of fixed income securities
      associated with the investment of our on-hand cash balances and approximately
      $3.6 million of intangible assets. Garmin’s average return on its investments
      during fiscal 2005 was approximately 3.1%. It is management’s goal to invest the
      on-hand cash consistent with Garmin’s investment policy, which has been approved
      by the Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to
      preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize
      yield
      within the constraint of low credit risk.


Cash
      flow
      related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2007 of $136.1
      million. During 2007, Garmin repurchased 57,235 shares of its common shares
      under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved by the
      Board of Directors on August 3, 2006 and expired on December 31, 2007. A new
      5,000,000 share repurchase plan was authorized in February 2008 which expires
      on
      December 31, 2009. Sources and uses in financing activities during 2007 related
      primarily to a use for the payment of a dividend ($162.5 million) and the
      purchase of stock ($14.2 million), and a source of cash from the issuance of
      common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options, the related
      tax
      benefit, and the employee stock purchase plan ($40.8 million). Cash flow related
      to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2006 of $132.7 million.
      During 2006, Garmin repurchased 1,155,300 shares of its common shares under
      the
      3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved by the Board of
      Directors on August 3, 2006 and expired on December 31, 2007. Sources and uses
      in financing activities during 2006 related primarily to uses for the payment
      of
      a dividend ($107.9 million) and stock repurchase ($50.5 million), and a source
      of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee
      stock options, the related tax benefit, and the employee stock purchase plan
      ($25.7 million). Cash flow related to financing activities resulted in a net
      use
      of cash in 2005 of $70.9 million. During 2005, Garmin repurchased 638,000 shares
      of its common shares under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that
      was
      approved by the Board of Directors on April 21, 2004 and expired on April 30,
      2006. Sources and uses in financing activities during 2005 related primarily
      to
      uses for the payment of a dividend ($54.0 million) and stock repurchase ($26.7
      million), and a source of cash from the issuance of common shares related to
      the
      exercise of employee stock options, the related tax benefit, and the employee
      stock purchase plan ($9.7 million).

Cash
      dividends paid to shareholders were $162.5 million, $107.9 million, and $54.0
      million during fiscal years 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

We
      believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will
      be
      sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and
      other
      cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2010.

We

Item
      7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
      Sensitivity

We
      have
      market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and
      services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials
      costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
      Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset
      pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product
      mix
      and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We
      do not
      believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial
      condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to
      significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such
      higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could
      adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
      operations.

Foreign
      Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The
      operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure
      to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not been
      significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the Taiwan
      Dollar, the Euro and British Pound have proven to be relatively stable. However,
      periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses
      due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of
      volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a
      significant effect on our results of operations.

The
      currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are
      the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and British Pound. Garmin Corporation, located
      in
      Shijr, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company
      translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income
      and
      expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the
      effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected
      to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable
      securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

The
      NTD/USD exchange rate decreased 0.3% during 2007, which resulted in a cumulative
      translation adjustment of negative $0.3 million at the end of fiscal 2007 and
      a
      net foreign currency loss of $2.5 million at Garmin Corporation during 2007.

Garmin
      France SAS, Garmin Deutschland GmbH, Garmin Italia S.p.A., and Garmin Iberia
      S.A., located in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain respectively, use the Euro
      as
      the functional currency

.

However,
      the functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe)
      Ltd.
      remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds
      or
      Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related
      to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company
      believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our
      European presence grows. In 2007, the Euro strengthened 10.2% relative to the
      U.S. dollar and the British Pound Sterling strengthened 1.7% relative to the
      U.S. dollar. These currency moves resulted in a foreign currency gain of $25.6
      million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries. These gains were offset
      by
      currency moves in the Taiwan dollar that generated losses described above,
      combined with other losses of $0.1 million, and the timing of transactions
      during the year for a net gain of $23.0 million for the Company.

If
      the
      TD/USD exchange rate had decreased 10%

and the
      GBP/USD and EUR/USD exchange rate had each increased 10% in 2007, the cumulative
      translation adjustment would have been a negative $0.4 million at the end of
      fiscal 2007 and the foreign currency loss would have been $109.5 million without
      the use of any hedging strategies.


Interest
      Rate Risk

We
      have
      no outstanding long-term debt as of December 29, 2007. We, therefore, have
      no
      meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We
      are
      exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable
      securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated
      with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. A hypothetical change of
      10%
      in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains
      or
      losses. At December 29, 2007, cumulative unrealized gains on those securities
      were $46.4 million.

Equity
      Price Risk

We
      are
      also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly-traded
      equity securities, which had an estimated fair value of $235.6 million at
      December 29, 2007 and $57.5 million at December 30, 2006. We monitor our
      equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the
      carrying value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value, and we determine
      the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value
      to
      its current fair value. Generally, we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate
      our
      market exposure on these equity securities. We do not purchase our equity
      securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. A hypothetical
      10% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities
      would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities
      of
      $23.5 million at December 29, 2007 and $5.8 million at December 30,
      2006.

Report
        of Ernst & Young LLP

Independent
        Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
        Ltd.

We
        have
        audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and
        Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
        and the
        related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash
        flows
        for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2007. Our audits
        also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item
        15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
        of the
        Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
        financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
        conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
        statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
        on a
        test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
        statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
        and
        significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
        financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
        reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
        our
        opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
        material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and
        Subsidiaries at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 and the consolidated
        results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
        in
        the period ended December 29, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
        accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
        schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
        as
        a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
        therein.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial
        reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on criteria established in the Internal
        Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
        of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2008 expressed
        an
        unqualified opinion thereon.

          Stock Split

On
          July  21, 2006 a two-for-one stock split was approved
          by  Garmin's shareholders and was effected at the close of the
          market on August 15, 2006. All prior period common stock and applicable
          share
          and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 2006
          stock
          split.

          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
          of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
          accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
          with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
          accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of
          Garmin
          Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances
          and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal
          Year

The
          Company has adopted a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of
          the
          calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a
          calendar
          year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including
          the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week
          fiscal
          year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain
          fiscal
          years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year
          occurs.

In
          those
          resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra
          week
          of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial
          results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter,
          will
          not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years
          and
          the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Fiscal 2007 and 2006 included
          weeks while fiscal 2005 included 53 weeks.


Foreign
            Currency Translation

GC
            utilizes the New Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. In accordance
            with
            Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52,

Foreign
            Currency Translation

,
            the
            financial statements of GC for all periods presented have been translated
            into
            United States dollars, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd. and GII,
            and the
            reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing
            during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates
            for all
            assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in
            a separate
            component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of ($315)
            and ($1,307) as of December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively,
            net of
            related taxes, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive
            gain/(loss)
            in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Transactions
            in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange
            at the
            transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions
            are
            translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.
            All
            differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange
            gains
            of $22,964, $596 and $15,265 for the years ended December 29, 2007, December
            30,
            2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. The gain in fiscal 2007 was
            the
            result of the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound Sterling relative
            to
            the United States dollar experienced by our European companies. The gain
            in
            fiscal 2006 was the result of nearly off-setting currency moves in the
            Taiwan
            Dollar and the Euro and British Pound Sterling. The gain in fiscal 2005
            was the
            result of strengthening of the United States dollar throughout those
            years.
            These gains and losses are included in other income in the accompanying
            consolidated statements of income.

Earnings
            Per Share

Basic
            earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average
            number of
            common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share,
            the
            number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock
            options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been
            purchased
            from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the
            Company’s
            stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 11.

Cash
            and Cash Equivalents

For
            purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
            on
            hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
            of
            three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and
            cash
            equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those
            instruments.

Trade
            Accounts Receivable

We
            sell
            our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend
            credit
            based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition.  Potential
            losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial
            condition. We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
            Typically, our accounts receivable are collected on within 60 days and
            do not
            bear interest. We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain
            allowances for potential losses or adjustments. We determine these allowances
            by
            (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk
            customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal
            collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount
            due.


Inventories

Inventories
          are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
          weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
          method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and GEL. Inventories consisted
          of
          the following:

Property
          and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
          method over the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings
                    and improvements

Long-Lived
        Assets

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
        for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
        the
        Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
        recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
        if it
        exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the
        use
        and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying
        amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
        loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived
        asset exceeds its fair value.

Dividends

On
        August
        1, 2007 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to
        be paid
        on September 14, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 15, 2007. The Company
        paid out a dividend in the amount of $162,531. The dividend has been reported
        as
        a reduction of retained earnings.

On
        April
        26, 2006 the Board of Directors declared a post-split dividend of $0.50 per
        share to be paid on December 15, 2006 to shareholders of record on December
        1,
        2006. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $107,923. The dividend
        has been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On
        July
        20, 2005 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share (post
        split) to be paid on December 15, 2005 to shareholders of record on December
        1,
        2005. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $53,974. The dividend
        has
        been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately
        $159,210 and $129,651 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from
        distribution to stockholders pursuant to the law of Taiwan at December 29,
        and December 30, 2006, respectively.


Intangible
        Assets

At
        December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, the Company had patents, license
        agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived
        intangible assets recorded at a cost of $159,503 and $76,148, respectively.
        The
        Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
        was $98,494 at December 29, 2007 and $24,457 at December 30, 2006.

Identifiable,
        finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
        lives
        on a straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization
        was
        $59,967 and $33,025 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 respectively.
        Amortization expense was $26,942, $21,147, and $22,648, for the years ended
        December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively.
        In
        the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $17,227,
        $16,441, $14,014, $13,830, and $8,108, respectively.

Marketable
        Securities

Management
        determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the
        time
        of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet
        date.

All
        of
        the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at
        December 29, 2007. See Note 4. Available-for-sale securities are stated at
        fair
        value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other
        comprehensive gain. At December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, cumulative
        unrealized gains/(losses) of $46,445 and $(3,968), respectively, were reported
        accumulated in other comprehensive gain/(loss), net of related
        taxes.

The
        amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted
        for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in
        the
        case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
        Such amortization is included in interest income from investments. Realized
        gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
        are
        included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
        identification method. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale
        securities have not been material in any period.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance
        with
        SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. The liability method provides
        that
        deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference
        between
        the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial
        reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will
        be in
        effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Income taxes have not
        been
        accrued by Garmin Corporation (GC) for the unremitted earnings of GI totaling
        approximately $301,402 and $272,732 at December 29, 2007 and December 30,
        2006,
        respectively, because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in this
        subsidiary indefinitely.  Similarly, income taxes have not been accrued by
        Garmin B.V. for the unremitted earnings of GC totaling approximately $628,323
        and $656,530 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006, respectively, nor
        have
        they been accrued by Garmin Ltd for the unremitted earnings of Garmin Europe
        totaling approximately $87,954 and $50,526 at December 29, 2007 and December
        30,
        2006, respectively, for the same reason.


The
        Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting
        for
        Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), on December 31, 2006, the beginning
        of
        fiscal year 2007.  As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, the Company
        has not recognized a material increase or decrease in the liability for
        unrecognized tax benefits.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
        as of the date of adoption was $70.5 million including interest of $3.3 million.
        The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2007 was
        $126.6
        million including interest of $4.7 million.  A reconciliation of the
        beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in
        $millions):

Balance

$

126.6

The
        December 29, 2007 balance of $126.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits,
        if
        recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized
        tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.

FIN
        requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities,
        except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the
        balance sheet date.  The Company previously classified these amounts as
        current liabilities, however after the adoption, the entire $126.6 million
        is
        required to be classified as non-current at December 29, 2007.

Interest
        expense and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are
        reflected in income tax expense.  $1.4 million of interest is included in
        income tax expense for the year ending December 29, 2007.  The Company had
        no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits,
        if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.

The
        Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various
        state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject
        to US federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years
        prior to 2004.  The Company also considers 2003 and 2004 US federal returns
        to have been effectively settled due to the completion of audit examination
        by
        the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan
        income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2002.  The
        Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax
        authorities for years prior to 2006.

At
        this
        time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing
        of
        payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the
        timing
        of potential tax audit outcomes.

Use
        of Estimates

The
        preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
        financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
        from
        those estimates.

Concentration
        of Credit Risk

The
        Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s
        pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require
        security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided
        for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and consistently have
        been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended
        terms consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms
        can
        be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing
        of new product releases by the Company.


Revenue
          Recognition

The
          Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is delivered
          to
          the customer and title has transferred. The Company assumes no remaining
          significant obligations associated with the product sale other than that
          related
          to its warranty programs discussed below.

Shipping
          and Handling Costs

Shipping
          and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying
          consolidated financial statements.

Product
          Warranty

The
          Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The
          warranty
          period is generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception
          of
          certain aviation products for which the warranty period is two years from
          the
          date of installation and certain marine products with warranty periods
          of three
          years from the date of shipment

.

Sales
          Programs

The
          Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers
          based
          on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth. Additionally,
          from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain
          products. Estimated rebates and incentives payable to distributors are
          regularly
          reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis. In addition,
          the
          Company provides retailers with product discounts termed “price protection” to
          assist these retailers in clearing older products from their inventories
          in
          advance of new product releases. These rebates, incentives, and price
          protections are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying
          consolidated statements of income.

Advertising
          Costs

The
          Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted
          to
          approximately $206,948, $114,749, and $59,309 for the years ended December
          29,
          2007, December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively.

Research
          and Development

A
          majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United
          States. Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred,
          amounted
          to approximately $159,406, $113,314, and $74,879 for the years ended December
          29, 2007, December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005,
          respectively.

Customer
          Service and Technical Support

Customer
          service and technical support costs are included on the sales and marketing
          expense line on our statements of operations. Customer service and technical
          support costs include costs associated with performing order processing,
          answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail
          and
          other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance
          to
          customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide
          a limited
          amount of free technical support assistance to customers. The technical
          support
          is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
          We
          accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.


Software
          Development Costs

Statement
          of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86,

“Accounting
          for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
          Marketed,”

requires
          companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until
          technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs
          are
          capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
          Our
          capitalized software development costs are not significant. SFAS 2,

“Accounting
          for Research and Development Costs,”

establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and development.
          In
          accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or
          after the general release of the service using the product are expensed
          in the
          period they are incurred and included in research and development costs
          on our
          statement of operations.

Accounting
          for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently sponsors three stock based employee compensation
          plans. On
          January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
          Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based
          Payment

,
          which
          is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
          for Stock-Based Compensation

.
          SFAS
          No. 123(R) requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
          expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
          including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated
          fair
          values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under
          Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
          for Stock Issued to Employees

,
          for
          periods beginning in fiscal 2006.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
          method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation costs are recognized
          beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS
          No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date
          and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to
          employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain
          unvested on the effective date. The Company’s consolidated financial statements
          as of and for fiscal years ended December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006
          reflect
          the impact of SFAS No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective
          transition method, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods
          prior to adoption have not been restated to reflect, and do not include,
          the
          impact of SFAS No. 123(R).

SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of
          share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing
          model.
          The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest
          is
          recognized as stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service
          period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to the adoption
          of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to
          employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance
          with APB
          Opinion No. 25 as allowed under SFAS No. 123. Under the intrinsic
          value method, no stock-based compensation expenses have been recognized
          in the
          Company’s consolidated statements of income for stock options because the
          exercise price of the Company’s stock options granted to employees and directors
          equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.

As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated
          statement of income for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2007 and December
          30, 2006 are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been
          reduced
          for estimated forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be
          estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
          periods
          if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated
          based on historical experience and management’s estimates. In the Company’s pro
          forma information required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to
          fiscal 2006, the Company accounted for stock option forfeitures as they
          occurred. The cumulative adjustment to reduce costs that were actually
          recognized to reflect estimated forfeitures is not material.


The
        following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
        if
        the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.

Recently
        Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        157, Fair Value Measurements (“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 establishes a
        framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about
        fair
        value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements
        that require or permit fair value measurements. This statement is effective
        for
        fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within
        those fiscal years. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in
        the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.

We
        do not
        expect the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have a material impact on our financial
        reporting and disclosure.

In
        February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        (“SFAS No. 159”), “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities.” SFAS No. 159 allows entities the option to measure eligible
        financial instruments at fair value as of specified dates. Such election,
        which
        may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis, is typically irrevocable
        once elected. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning
        after November 15, 2007, and early application is allowed under certain
        circumstances. Management is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS
        No. 159 and has not yet determined the impact, if any, on the Company’s
        consolidated financial statements.

In
        June
        2007, the FASB also ratified EITF 07-3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance
        Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and
        Development Activities" ("EITF 07-3"). EITF 07-3 requires that
        nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or
        rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and
        capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the
        related services are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective, on a prospective
        basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and will be
        adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The Company does
        not
        expect the adoption of EITF 07-3 to have a material effect on the Company's
        consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
        December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business
        Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R establishes principles and
        requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial
        statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any
        noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired.
        SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation
        of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R
        is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will
        be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The Company
        is
        currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of
        SFAS 141R on its consolidated results of operations and financial
        condition.

Certain
          cash balances of GEL are held as collateral by a bank securing payment
          of the
          United Kingdom value-added tax requirements. The total amount of restricted
          cash
          balances were $1,554 and $1,525 at December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006,
          respectively.

In
          the
          normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties
          to
          various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
          patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various
          other
          risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the
          Company
          and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal
          matters, or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company’s management
          does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will
          have a
          material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial
          position or cash flows.

We
          may be
          required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.
          However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated
          with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable
          estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective
          taxing
          authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $126.6 million as
          of
          December 29, 2007, have been excluded from the contractual obligations
          table
          above. For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see
          Note 7,
“Income Taxes”, to the consolidated financial statements included in this
          Report.

          Employee Benefit Plans

GII
          sponsors a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which its
          employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject
          to
          Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which GII contributes
          a
          specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain
          limits as defined in the Plan. Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution
          plan
          under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual
          compensation. Both GII and GEL contribute an amount determined annually
          at the
          discretion of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 29,
          2007,
          December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, expense related to these plans
          of
          $11,412, $8,690, and $6,378, was charged to operations.

Certain
          of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit
          pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final
          pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years
          ended
          December 29, 2007, December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, were significant.

          Income Taxes

The
          Company’s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the
          following:

The
        income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory
        federal income tax rate to income before taxes. The sources and tax effects
        of
        the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals,
        are as follows:

          $850,102, $508,367, and $307,712, for the years ended December 29, 2007,
          December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. The Taiwan tax
          holiday
          benefits included in the table above reflect $0.20, $0.24, and $0.22 per
          weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December
          29, 2007,
          December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively. The Company currently
          expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2012, at which
          time
          these tax benefits expire.

        Fair Value of Financial Instruments

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 107,

Disclosures
        about Fair Value of Financial Instruments

,
        the
        following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain
        financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such
        value. None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading
        purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial
        instruments are as follows:

For
        certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable,
        accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate
        fair value due to their short maturities.


9.
        Segment Information

The
        Company operates within its targeted markets through four reportable segments,
        those being related to products sold into the marine, automotive/mobile,
        outdoor/fitness, and aviation markets. All of the Company’s reportable segments
        offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and
        distributors as well as through OEM’s. However, the nature of products and types
        of customers for the four segments vary significantly. As such, the segments
        are
        managed separately. The Company’s marine, automotive/mobile, and outdoor/fitness
        segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and
        accessories sold primarily to retail outlets. These products are produced
        primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s aviation products
        are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument
        Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain
        aircraft manufacturers.

The
        Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating
        Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources
        based on income before income taxes of each segment.

Income
        before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including
        certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense,
        foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses.
        The
        accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described
        in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment
        sales or transfers.

The
        identifiable assets associated with each reportable segment reviewed by the
        CODM
        include accounts receivable and inventories. The Company does not report
        property and equipment, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization,
        or
        capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

Revenues,
        interest income and interest expense, income before income taxes, and
        identifiable assets for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented

            Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting
            for Stock-Based Compensation

The
            various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below:

            Equity Incentive Plan

In
            June
            2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”)
            providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
“other”
stock compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
            pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance.
            The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period
            of
            five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the
            Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of
            grant, if
            not exercised. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, the Company granted 2,838,200,
            2,341,800, and 896,000 stock appreciation rights, respectively.

            Equity Incentive Plan

In
            October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the
“2000
            Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and
            “other” stock compensation awards to employees of the Company and its
            subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares of common
            stock
            were available for issuance. The stock options and stock appreciation
            rights
            vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by
            the Board
            of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years
            from
            the date of grant, if not exercised. During 2007, the Company granted
            20,000
            stock appreciation rights and during 2006 and 2005 the Company granted
            64,131
            and 755,750 nonqualified stock options, respectively.

            Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

Also
            in
            October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
            directors (the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up
            to 100,000
            common shares. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly
            over
            a three-year period. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, options to purchase
            5,562,
            7,630, and 11,000 shares, respectively, were granted under this plan.


Stock-Based
              Compensation Activity

A
              summary
              of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under
              the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and
              the 2000
              Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan for the years ended December 29, 2007,
              December 30, 2006, and December 31, 2005 is provided below:

The
            weighted-average remaining contract life for options outstanding and
            exercisable
            at December 29, 2007 are 7.88 and 6.11 years. respectively.

The
            fair
            value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
            option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions
            for 2007,
            2006 and 2005:

The
            Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
            the
            fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
            fully
            transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input
            of highly
            subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.
            Because
            the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly
            different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
            input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
            opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
            measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

The
            total
            fair value of shares vested during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $17,840, $9,413,
            and
            $8,249, respectively.

The
            aggregate intrinsic values of options outstanding and exercisable at
            December 29, 2007 were $508.0 million and $236.3 million, respectively. The
            aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended
            December 29, 2007 was $75.5 million. Aggregate intrinsic value represents
            the positive difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last
            trading day of the fiscal period, which was $99.17 on December 28, 2007,
            and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options outstanding.

As
            of
            December 29, 2007, there was $137.8 million of total unrecognized
            compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards
            granted to
            employees under the option plans. That cost is expected to be recognized
            over a
            period of five years.

Employee
            Stock Purchase Plan

The
            shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up
            to
            2,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares
            will be
            offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
            market
            value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market
            value on
            the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock
            purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2007,
            2006, and 2005, 120,230, 124,693, and 112,798 shares, respectively were
            purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $5,730, $3,569,
            and
            $2,824, respectively. At December 29, 2007, approximately 996,581 shares
            were
            available for future issuance.

11.
            Earnings Per Share

The
            following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income
            per
            share:


Options
      to purchase 886,000, 757,000, and 1,044,000 common shares were outstanding
      during 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively, but were not included in the
      computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was
      antidilutive.

12.
      Share Repurchase Program

The
      Board
      of Directors approved a share repurchase program on August 3, 2006, authorizing
      the Company to purchase up to 3,000,000 of its common shares as market and
      business conditions warrant. The share repurchase authorization expired on
      December 31, 2007. From inception to expiration, 1,212,535 shares were
      repurchased and retired under this plan.

The
      Board
      of Directors approved a share repurchase program on April 21, 2004, authorizing
      the Company to purchase up to 6,000,000 million of its common shares as market
      and business conditions warrant. The share repurchase authorization expired
      on
      April 30, 2006. From inception to expiration, 1,476,000 shares were repurchased
      and retired under this plan.

13.
      Shareholder Rights Plan

On
      October 24, 2001, Garmin’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
      (the “Rights Plan”). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend
      of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share of Garmin
      to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2001. The rights trade together
      with
      Garmin’s common shares. The rights generally will become exercisable if a person
      or group acquires or announces an intention to acquire 15% or more of Garmin’s
      outstanding common shares. Each right (other than those held by the new 15%
      shareholder) will then be exercisable to purchase preferred shares of Garmin
      (or

The
        above
        quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management,
        all

        Acquisitions

In
        the
        first quarter of 2007, Garmin Ltd. acquired EME TecSat SAS (the exclusive
        distributor of Garmin’s consumer products in France which has since been renamed
        Garmin France SAS), Digital Cyclone, Inc. (a location based services provider),
        and the assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc. (a manufacturer of the
        TR-1
        Gold and Gladiator marine autopilots).

In
        the
        third quarter of 2007, Garmin Ltd. acquired GPS Gesellschaft fur Professionelle
        Satellitennavigation mbH (Garmin’s exclusive distributor of consumer products in
        Germany which has since been renamed Garmin Deutschland GmbH).

In
        the
        fourth quarter of 2007, Garmin Ltd. acquired Electronica Trepat SA (Garmin’s
        distributor of consumer products in Spain and now renamed Garmin Iberia S.A.)
        and Synergy S.p.A (Garmin’s distributor of consumer products in Italy which has
        since been renamed Garmin Italia S.p.A.).

These
        companies were acquired for $150.0 million less $21.2 million cash acquired.
        The
        preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in an increase in goodwill
        and
        intangible assets of $110.6 million. These acquisitions are not material,
        either
        individually or in aggregate, therefore supplemental pro forma information
        is
        not presented.

        Warranty Reserves

The
        Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging
        from one to two years. The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
        obligations are based on historical experience and expectation of future
        conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The following
        reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty
        reserve:

          Subsequent Events

On
          January 17, 2008, Garmin Ltd. acquired Fairpoint Navigation A/S, the distributor
          of Garmin’s consumer products in Denmark. The company has since been renamed
          Garmin Danmark A/S. This acquisition was not material.

The
          Board
          of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 4, 2008,
          authorizing the Company to purchase up to 5,000,000 million of its common
          shares
          as market and business conditions warrant. The share repurchase authorization
          expires on December 31, 2009.

The
          range
          of low and high closing sales prices of Garmin’s common shares as reported on
          the Nasdaq Stock Market between December 30, 2007 and February 22, 2008
          have
          been $59.36 and $97.00.

(a)
            Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
            Procedures

Under
            the
            supervision and with the participation of our management, including the
            Chief
            Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the
            effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
            and
            procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the
            period
            covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive
            Officer and
            Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls
            and
            procedures are effective.

(b)
            Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
            Reporting

Management
            of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
            internal
            control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control
            over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
            assurance
            regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
            of
            financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted
            accounting principles.

Because
            of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
            may not
            prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
            of
            effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
            may become
            inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
            with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s
            assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control
            over
            financial reporting did not include the operations resulting from the
            five
            acquisitions (collectively “the Acquisitions”) which were acquired during fiscal
            2007 and are included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements.
            The
            financial reporting systems of the Acquisitions were integrated into
            the
            company’s financial reporting systems throughout 2007. Therefore, the company
            did not have the practical ability to perform an assessment of their
            internal
            controls in time for this current year end. The company fully expects
            to include
            the Acquisitions in next year’s assessment. The Acquisitions constituted $313.1
            million and $88.8 million of total and net assets, respectively, as of
            December
            29, 2007 and $209.6 million and $2.9 million of revenues and net loss,
            respectively, for the year then ended in the consolidated financial
            statements.

Management
            of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
            financial reporting as of December 29, 2007. In making this assessment,
            management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
            Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated
            Framework”.

Based
            on
            such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
            maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
            December
            29, 2007.

Ernst
            & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
            the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on
            management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
            reporting as of December 29, 2007, as stated in their report which is
            included
            herein. That attestation report appears below.

Report
            of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
            over
            Financial Reporting

The
            Board
            of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
            Ltd.

We
            have
            audited Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
            29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
            issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
            (the COSO criteria)

.

Garmin
            Ltd.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
            over
            financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
            control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s
            Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility
            is to
            express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting
            based on our audit.

We
            conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
            we plan
            and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
            internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
            respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
            over
            financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
            testing
            and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
            based
            on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
            necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
            reasonable
            basis for our opinion.

A
            company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
            provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
            and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
            accordance
            with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
            financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
            to
            the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
            fairly
            reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
            (2)
            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
            to
            permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
            accepted
            accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
            are
            being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
            of
            the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
            or timely
            detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
            assets that could have a material effect on the financial
            statements.

Because
            of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting
            may not
            prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
            of
            effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
            may become
            inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
            with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

As
            indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
            Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the
            effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include
            the
            internal controls of its 2007 acquisitions, which are included in the
            consolidated financial statements of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and
            constituted $313.1 million and $88.8 million of total and net assets,
            respectively, as of December 29, 2007 and $209.6 million and $2.9 million
            of
            revenues and net loss, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit
            of
            internal control over financial reporting of Garmin Ltd. also did not
            include an
            evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of its 2007
            acquisitions.

In
            our
            opinion, Garmin Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective
            internal
            control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2007, based on

the
            COSO
            criteria

.

We
            have
            also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
            Accounting
            Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin
            Ltd. and Subsidiaries

as
            of
            December 29, 2007 and December 30, 2006 and the related consolidated
            statements
            of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
            the period ended December 29, 2007 and our report dated February 25,
            expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
