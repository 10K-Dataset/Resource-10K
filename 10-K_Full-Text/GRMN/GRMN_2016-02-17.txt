Company Overview

For over 25 years,
Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) has pioneered new Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation
and wireless devices and applications that are designed for people who live an active lifestyle. Garmin serves five primary business
units, including auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures, markets and distributes
a diverse family of hand-held, wearable, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications, sensor-based
and information products. Since the inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 157 million products, which includes the
delivery of more than 16 million products during 2015.

Overview of the Global Positioning System

The Global Positioning
System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
technology. The system consists of numerous constellations of orbiting satellites. Access to the systems is provided free of charge.

Garmin utilizes a variety
of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) including, but not limited to:

·

The satellites and their ground control
and monitoring stations maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite
replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.

·

Japan’s MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation
System (MSAS) which achieved initial operating capability for enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation on September
27, 2007.

·

The European Geostationary Navigation
Overlay Service (EGNOS) aviation Safety of Life (SoL) service which achieved initial operating capability for enroute, terminal,
and approach navigation on March 2, 2011.

·

The Global Navigation Satellite System
(GLONASS), a space-based satellite navigation system operated by the Russian Federation, consisting of 24 satellites and providing
world-wide coverage. In certain urban canyon or restricted sky visibility situations, the use of both GPS and GLONASS satellites
to produce a navigation fix may result in improved accuracy.

The accuracy and utility
of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) comprising
ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States
and most of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of
WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications.

Competition

In general, we operate
in highly competitive markets though competitive conditions do vary among our diverse products and geographies.  Garmin believes
the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design, functionality, quality and reliability, customer
service, brand, price, time-to-market and availability.  Garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these
areas and as such, is generally a significant competitor in each of our major markets.

Garmin believes that
its principal competitors for portable automotive products are TomTom N.V. and MiTAC Digital Corporation (MiTAC) (which distributes
products under the brand names of Magellan, Mio, and Navman). Garmin believes that its principal competitors for infotainment solutions
are Harman International Industries, Panasonic Corporation, and the Mitsubishi Group. Garmin believes that its principal competitors

Research and Development

Garmin’s product
innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering
and manufacturing teams. Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 3,412 people
worldwide as of December 26, 2015. Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely
with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s
development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and
cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success.
Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition
it into manufacturing.

Manufacturing and Operations

Garmin believes one
of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi,
Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes
that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability
and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.

Specifically, Garmin
believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality and time
to market.


Cost:

Garmin’s
manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency,
resulting in lower cost. Garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging our manufacturing resources across high,
mid and low volume products. Sharing of these resources across our product lines favorably affects Garmin’s costs to produce
its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of the high volume products. The ownership and
integration of our resources allows Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of our products, yielding improved cost.

Quality:

Garmin’s
automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enables
Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our
products. Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams providing
integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.

Time to Market:

Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products,
allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing. This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable
faster time to market.

Garmin’s

design,
manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001,
an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s automotive operations
in Taiwan and Olathe have achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin’s new China
facility in Yangzhou has received a TS16949 letter of conformance and expects to be formally certified in fourth quarter 2016.
Garmin’s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation
industry.

Garmin International,
Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd. and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to
the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment
and continually strive to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Although most components
essential to Garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained
by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components
that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM),
GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.

Garmin and other participants
in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for
various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, Garmin uses some
custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and consumer electronics
industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin
has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has
increased. Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important
components. Nevertheless, if Garmin’s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product was delayed
or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed
shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected. Garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to
obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.
Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate
on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin’s requirements.


Seasonality

Our sales are subject
to seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during
the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season
and the Mother’s Day/Father’s Day/graduation buying season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing
of the release of new products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the
timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

Our sales are generally
of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information
is not material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability
to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often
relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography
technology for use in our products from various sources.

As of January 7, 2016, Garmin’s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 950 patent and 640 trademark
registrations issued worldwide.  Generally, patents issued in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest
asserted filing date of the patent application. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable
local law. For the past eight years Garmin has been selected as a constituent of the Ocean Tomo® 300 Patent Index which recognizes
companies with high intellectual property value. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our
employees and their ability to continue to innovate.  Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when
appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

There is no assurance
that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others
will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized
parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates
is subject to change. In accordance with the United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations,
wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they
are sold. Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A
delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification
for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business. In addition, aviation products that are intended for
installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the
European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.


Because Garmin Corporation,
one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan
with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange
Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred
to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from
exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the
import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks. Aside from trade-related
foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan
foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits
apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies. The CBC typically
approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons
justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign
debt with the CBC.

Environmental Matters

Garmin’s operations
are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances
and wastes.  Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget.

Environmental regulation
of Garmin’s products is increasing.  Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and
material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.  Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers
to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Compliance
with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental
laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

Garmin has implemented
multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards,
and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility,
Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facility.

Regulatory and “Green
Procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing; particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly
design and manufacture initiatives.  The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.  Garmin
is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.

Employees

As of December 26,
2015, Garmin had 11,651 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 4,333 were in the United States, 88 were in Canada, 5,289
were in Taiwan, 1,294 were in Europe, and 647 were in other global locations. Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Brazil
and Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.


Item 1A. Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the
only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial
may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results
could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Company

If we are not successful in the continued
development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We expect that a significant
portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products
is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce
new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer
needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research
and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such
products. However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will
achieve significant customer acceptance.

If we are unable to
successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations
would be adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license
new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may
materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to
new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and
there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability of these
products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new
products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval,
or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we are unable to compete effectively
with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders,
reduced margins and loss of market share.

The markets for many
of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or
emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers. Increased competition could result in
price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against
current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The demand for personal navigation devices
(PNDs) has been and continues to be reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile devices and factory-installed
systems in new autos, as well as by market saturation.

GPS/navigation technologies
have been incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.
Many companies are now offering navigation software for these mobile devices. The acceptance of this technology by consumers has
reduced sales in this segment and has reduced margins in some periods. Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as standard
and/or optional equipment on new automobiles. Increased navigation penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles is expected
to cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and could further reduce margins.

Our annual and quarterly financial statements
will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements
in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening
of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect
on our results of operations. The Company has not historically hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.


The currencies that
create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. The Taiwan
Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation. The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe. The
Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries. As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material
gains and losses. Additionally, Euro denominated inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and
losses. Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency. Due to the relative size of entities
using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within
these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The Company translates all
assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.

U.S.
GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into functional currency all U.S. Dollar denominated
assets and liabilities. This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements
as the U.S. Dollar strengthens or weakens against the various functional currencies. Such gain or loss will create variations
in our earnings per share. Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue
to focus on the Company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.

The auto segment, which represents approximately
37% of our revenues, is expected to continue to decline in 2016.

We experienced substantial
growth through 2008 in the auto segment of our business as the products became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe
and North America. This market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred. This has resulted
in, and could continue to result in, periods of lower revenues for this segment and lower earnings per share.

Economic conditions and uncertainty
could adversely affect our revenue and margins.

Our revenue and margins
depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness
or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased
revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties
experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs
and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we do not correctly anticipate demand
for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have
costly excess production or inventories.

We have generally been
able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand. However, the demand for our products depends on many factors
and may be difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a
diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products
mature. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:

·

If demand increases beyond what we forecast,
we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those
suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.

·

Rapid increases in production levels to
meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses. These higher
costs could lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may
also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.

·

If forecasted demand does not develop,
we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some
or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing
efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.


We depend on our suppliers, some of
which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able
to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.

We are dependent on
third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. Some of the components that we procure from third party
suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Some components
we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are
manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.

In the past we have
experienced shortages of certain components. In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components
may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative
source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely
and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.

Gross margins for our products may fluctuate
or erode.

Gross margins in some
of our segments have declined in recent years and could further decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that
are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due
to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific
product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost
reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing
new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices. However, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products
in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products
do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.


Changes in our United States federal income tax classification
or in applicable tax laws could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

Legislative proposals
have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations
with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident
in the United States.  Legislative proposals are being considered in Switzerland that could make significant changes in the
corporate tax regime and increase the taxes applicable to us in Switzerland.  Our tax position could be adversely impacted
by changes in Swiss, United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof
by any tax authority. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.

Recently, the Organization
for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued final recommendations to prevent perceived base erosion and profit shifting
by multinational corporations. While these recommendations are not changes to tax law, the countries where we operate may implement
legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements.

We do not believe that
we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’
for United States federal income tax purposes.  We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.  However,
because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets
meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that
may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.  If
we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable
to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder
sells our common shares at a gain.  Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which
a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with
respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned
above.

We
do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation
(CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes. We do not expect to become a CFC. The CFC determination is made daily based
on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company. Only United
States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s shares qualify as United States shareholders.
Currently the Company has two shareholders that qualify as United States shareholders owning greater than ten percent of the voting
power, totaling 35% of the outstanding shares.  Thus, the addition of even one additional ten percent or greater United States
shareholder could result in classification as a CFC and subject all such holders to significant tax consequences. If the Company
were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company’s shareholders that qualify
as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain
categories of the Company’s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC. As the Company cannot control
the ownership of the Company’s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company’s stock
buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being
treated as a CFC.

We have benefited in the past from Taiwan
government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our
effective tax rate has historically been lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives
offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits

has
begun to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate and reduced benefits will continue into the future.


We may experience unique economic and political risks associated
with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Relations between Taiwan
and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions
of Taiwan in the future could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price
and the liquidity of our shares. Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted
aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan has a unique
international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all
of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic
and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that
it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.
Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively
affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.

Our intellectual property rights are
important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others.

We rely on a combination
of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications
to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications
will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. Moreover, even if approved, our
patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.
Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.

Third parties may claim
that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property
rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement. Litigation concerning patents
or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant
us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities
and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.

We may become subject to significant
product liability costs.

If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could
occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products
could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death. If our automotive or marine products contain
defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper
use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these
events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances,
could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.
However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such
insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards
of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.
If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover
the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in
adverse outcomes.

We are subject to a
variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive
relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties
and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer
unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. A material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably
estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

We collect, store, process, and use
personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related
to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could
harm our business.

We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. Our users’ fitness-related
data and personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account
information, height, weight, age, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns. Due to the volume
and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products, the security features of our platform
and information systems are critical. If our security measures and applications are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may
be able to obtain access to user data. If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with
which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience a breach of systems compromising our users’ data or
the media suggested that our security measures were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of
our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. Depending
on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may
also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy

for the individuals affected by the incident. A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer
notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach
notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations
could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user
data. Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems are
not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service
providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users’ information
at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy
terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance
coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber
risk.

Regulatory authorities
around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the
interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in
flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If
so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could
have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial
costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.

Security breaches and other disruptions, including as a result
of cyber attacks, may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

In the ordinary course
of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information
and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities
and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. A
breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our customers'
or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.  A cybersecurity
breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception
of the security or reliability of our products or services.

We have technology
and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized
access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time,
we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications
we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly
compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud,
trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques
or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate
training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate
this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.


Actual or anticipated
attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies,
to train employees, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. Our technology errors and omissions insurance may
not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.
If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial
losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a
system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private
litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or
remediation costs.

We depend on third party licensors for
the digital map data contained in our auto products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable
to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.

We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources. There are only a limited
number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region. The two largest digital map suppliers are HERE (formerly known
as NAVTEQ) and TomTom N.V. HERE is owned by Here Acquisition B.V. (a consortium of Daimler AG, BMW AG and Audi AG). Here Acquisition
B.V. is owned by competitors to other global OEMs, who may not wish to utilize mapping content from a competitor. TomTom N.V. is
a competitor of Garmin.

Although we do not foresee
difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and
HERE in February 2015 extending our HERE license agreement through 2024, if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data
and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with HERE changes detrimentally, our ability
to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.

We may have additional income tax liabilities.

We are subject to income
taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates
are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical
income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision,
net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Failure to obtain required certifications of our products
on a timely basis could harm our business.

We have certain products,
especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.
To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce
new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes. Delays in our obtaining certification
for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result, in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.
Therefore, such inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we cannot assure you that
our certified products will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.


Our business may suffer if we are not
able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our future success depends
partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.
We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance
payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions. We do not have key man
life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The loss of the services
of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel
we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide
shortage of qualified engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been
challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand
our business.

Our quarterly operating results are
subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our operating results
are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline,
the price of our stock could decline. As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and
development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development
costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically, our revenues
have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally
lower in this quarter. Sales of certain of our fitness, marine and automotive

products tend to be higher in our second fiscal
quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season. Sales of many of our consumer
products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during
the holiday season.

In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer
spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.

We rely on independent dealers and distributors
to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because we sell many
of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory
levels and support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in
their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient
levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.

Many of our dealers
and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable
terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain
or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with
dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.

We may pursue strategic acquisitions,
investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify,
complete and integrate such transactions.

We intend to evaluate
acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products,
or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings,
additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition,
investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete
those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.


Any past or future acquisitions
could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s
attention away from other business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to
integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide
not to work for us. We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other
corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make
in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

There is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability
to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.

We are a Swiss company
and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be difficult
to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland
or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability
provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in
Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

A shut down of Federal Aviation Administration
operations would harm our business.

Any failure of
Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in any shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees
could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration
of aircraft that use our avionics products. Such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Many of our products rely on the Global
Positioning System.

The Global Positioning
System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites
and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense. The Department
of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground support systems
are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally
designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate. However,
of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.

To repair damaged or
malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable,
there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites
may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. GPS satellites
and ground control segments are being modernized. GPS modernization software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access
to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.

GPS is operated by the
U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS were
no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Some of our products
also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System
(WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby
impacting our markets.


Any of the foregoing
factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products
based on competing technologies.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties
caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.

Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially
any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism,
may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have
an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

A shut down of airspace
or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business. The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of
our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to
our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers
and distributors.

Any reallocation or repurposing of radio
frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference
could harm our business.

Our Global Positioning
System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global
Positioning System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for
radio navigation satellite services. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations
that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference. 
Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations
and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or national
reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications
of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products
and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.

We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks
related to climate change.

Climate change is receiving increasing
attention worldwide.  Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases,
including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Various
regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
In the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and
welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under
the Clean Air Act. At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory
greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program, does not appear likely at this time, although it
could be adopted at a future date. It is also possible that Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate
a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency, which could increase
the cost of doing business

.


Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations
will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

Risks Relating
to Our Shares

The volatility of our stock price could
adversely affect investment in our common shares.

The market price of
our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During 2015, the closing price of our common shares
ranged from a low of $32.28 to a high of $56.81. A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate,
perhaps substantially, including:

·

new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

·

general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations
in interest rates and global currency exchange rates;

·

announcements of technological innovations;

·

product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;

·

developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

·

the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components,
such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products;

·

quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;

·

changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates;

·

developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and
litigation;

·

announcements and rumors of developments related to our business,
our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete;

·

research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage
houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers;

·

any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan
or significant markets where we sell our products; and

·

other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.

In addition, in recent
years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in
the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over
us.

As of January 25, 2016,
current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families
and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 41.1% of
our outstanding common shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring
shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. This level of ownership may have a significant
effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights
of other holders of our common shares.


The rights of our shareholders are governed
by Swiss law.

The rights of our shareholders
are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.’s articles of association. The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from
the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting
at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a
shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed
at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally, subject to specified
exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders
to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various
terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval
by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For
example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders.
These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater
flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.

The Company has limited capital reserves
from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.

If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying
capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a
rate of 35%. Over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for
par value reductions or dividends will be limited.  The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid
to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States
of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund
of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders
with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). However, there can
be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution
reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules
will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular
as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other
restrictions. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital
contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes

Under current Swiss
tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss
withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. However, the portion of the repurchase price
that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding
tax. Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of qualifying capital reserves available for distributions
to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes.  No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered
if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient qualifying capital
reserves are available. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient qualifying
capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.

We may follow a share
repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the SIX Swiss Exchange
in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive
a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase
shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase
of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent
that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.


We have certain limitations on our ability
to repurchase and hold our own shares.

Under Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. We and our subsidiaries may
only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus
as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us
and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory
limit of 10%, however, if our share-holders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board
of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation.
Our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares is a significant component of our capital management and shareholder return practices
that we believe is important to our shareholders, and any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock
less attractive to investors.

As mentioned previously,
we do not believe that we, or any of our United States or non-United States subsidiaries, are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation
(CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.  However, the repurchase of the Company’s shares reduces the number
of shares outstanding which is the basis for determining the ownership percentages for determination of whether the United States
shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.  Only United States persons that own
ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s shares qualify as United States shareholders.  We may be limited
in the number of shares we repurchase due to United States shareholders holding percentages.

Item 3.	Legal Proceedings

ICON Health &
Fitness, Inc. v. Garmin Ltd., Garmin International, Inc., and Garmin USA, Inc.

On November 18, 2011,
ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against Garmin Ltd., Garmin
International, Inc., and Garmin USA, Inc. (collectively “Garmin”), alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,789,800
(the ‘800 patent”) and 6,701,271 (“the ‘271 patent”).  On June 8, 2012, ICON filed an amended
complaint alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,626,799 and 6,921,351.  On June 25, 2012, Garmin filed its answer asserting
that each asserted claim of these additional patents-in-suit is invalid and/or not infringed.  On April 11, 2013, the Court
dismissed ICON’s allegations of infringement of the ‘800 and ‘271 patents against Garmin without prejudice pursuant
to a motion filed by ICON. On September 29, 2015, the court awarded summary judgment in favor of Garmin finding (a) that the ‘351
patent had been held to be invalid for indefiniteness by another federal district court and the doctrine of issue preclusion applied
to prevent ICON from relitigating this issue, and (b) that the ‘799 patent is invalid because it covers unpatentable subject
matter.  On November 18, 2015, ICON appealed the Court’s summary judgment ruling of invalidity of the ‘351 patent. 
ICON did not appeal the Court’s invalidity finding on the ‘799 patent.  Although there can be no assurance that
an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.

In the Matter of
Certain Marine Sonar Imaging Systems, Products Containing the Same and Components Thereof

On July 18, 2014, Johnson Outdoors Inc. and Johnson Outdoors Marine Electronics Inc. filed a complaint
with the United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America,
Inc., Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin Corporation (collectively “Garmin”) alleging a violation of Section 337 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended, through alleged infringement by Garmin of U.S. Patents 7,652,952 (“the ’952 patent”);
7,710,825 (“the ’825 patent”); and 7,755,974 (“the ’974 patent”).  On August 15, 2014
the ITC instituted an investigation pursuant to the complaint. Garmin believes that each asserted claim of the ‘952 patent,
the ‘825 patent, and the ‘974 patent is invalid and/or not infringed and, in addition, that the ’952, ’825,
and ’974 patents are unenforceable under the doctrine of inequitable conduct and that Johnson Outdoors’ claims are
barred in whole or in part by the doctrines of prosecution history estoppel and/or prosecution disclaimer. A trial hearing before
the Administrative Law Judge was held on April 7 through April 10, 2015. On November 18, 2015 the ITC issued a Final Determination
finding that the asserted claims of the ’952, ’825, and ’974 patents are valid and enforceable but that there
is no infringement by Garmin of any of the asserted claims of the ’952 and ’825 patents and that there is no infringement
by Garmin of claim 25 of the ’974 patent. The ITC found that there is infringement by Garmin of claims 14, 18, 21-23 and
33 of the ’974 patent and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting the import into the U.S. of infringing products and
a cease and desist order prohibiting certain domestic activities relating to the infringing products.  On January 16, 2016,
Johnson Outdoors filed a petition for review of the ITC’s Final Determination in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On February 2, 2016, Garmin moved to intervene in Johnson Outdoors' appeal. That motion
was granted on February 4, 2016. On February 10, 2016, Garmin filed its petition for review of the abovementioned Final Determination
with the Federal Circuit. Garmin is seeking review of all issues appealable in the case.

Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit.


In the Matter of
Certain Marine Sonar Imaging Devices, Including Downscan and Sidescan Devices, Products Containing the Same, and Components Thereof

On June 9, 2014 Navico Inc. and Navico Holding AS filed a complaint with the United States International
Trade Commission (“ITC”) against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America, Inc., Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin
(Asia) Corporation (collectively “Garmin”) alleging a violation of Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended,
through alleged infringement by Garmin of U.S. Patents 8,300,499 (“the ’499 patent”); 8,305,840 (“the ’840
patent”); and 8,605,550 (“the ’550 patent”). On July 9, 2014 the ITC instituted an investigation pursuant
to the complaint. Garmin believes that each asserted claim of the ‘499 patent, the ‘840 patent, and the ‘550
patent is invalid and/or not infringed. A trial hearing before the Administrative Law Judge was held on March 18 through March
24, 2015. The Administrative Law Judge issued his initial determination on July 2, 2015 finding that the asserted claims of the
‘840, ‘499 and ‘550 patents are valid but that there is no infringement by Garmin of the ‘840 patent, the
‘499 patent or the ‘550 patent.  On December 1, 2015 the ITC issued a Final Determination finding that most of
the asserted claims of the ‘840, ‘499 and ‘550 patents are valid and that there is no infringement by Garmin
of the ‘499 patent but that there is infringement by Garmin of the ‘840 and ‘550 patents. The ITC held that claims
1, 7, 12, 13, and 57 of the ‘550 patent were invalid as obvious.  The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting
the import into the U.S. of infringing products and a cease and desist order prohibiting certain domestic activities relating to
the infringing products. On January 27, 2016, Navico filed a petition for review of the ITC’s Final Determination in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal Circuit”). On February 10, 2016, Garmin filed with the
Federal Circuit: (i) a motion to intervene in Navico's appeal, and (ii) a petition for review of the abovementioned Final Determination.
Garmin is seeking review of all issues appealable in the case, including the portions of the Final Determination finding infringement
of the ’840 and ’550 patents.

Although there
can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit

Johnson Outdoors
Inc. and Johnson Outdoors Marine Electronics, Inc. v.  Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America, Inc. and Garmin USA,
Inc.

On July 17, 2014, Johnson
Outdoors Inc. and Johnson Outdoors Marine Electronics Inc. filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District
of Alabama, Northern Division, against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin North America, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. (collectively,
“Garmin “) alleging infringement of U.S. Patents 7,652,952 (“the ’952 patent”); 7,710,825 (“the
’825 patent”); and 7,755,974 (“the ’974 patent”). On August 15, 2014, Garmin filed an answer. 
On October 17, 2014, Garmin filed an amended answer. In its amended answer Garmin asserts that each asserted claim of the ‘952
patent, the ‘825 patent and the ‘974 patent is invalid and/or not infringed and, in addition, that the ’952,
’825, and ’974 patents are unenforceable under the doctrine of inequitable conduct, and that Johnson Outdoors’
claims are barred in whole or in part by the doctrines of prosecution history estoppel and/or prosecution disclaimer  and
Garmin seeks treble damages against Johnson Outdoors for antitrust violations under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §
2.  On May 12, 2015, pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the court entered an order staying this lawsuit until there
is a final decision in the ITC investigation described above under

In the Matter of Certain Marine Sonar Imaging Systems, Products
Containing the Same and Components Thereof

including any Federal Circuit appeals but not including any Supreme Court petitions
or appeals. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse
effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit
and intends to vigorously defend this action.


Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and
all others similarly situated, v. Garmin Ltd. and Garmin International, Inc.

On December 18, 2013,
a purported class action lawsuit was filed against Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois.  The lead plaintiff was Andrea Katz, on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated. 
The class of plaintiffs that Andrea Katz purported to represent includes all individuals who purchased any model of Forerunner
watch in the State of Illinois and the United States. Plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of express warranty,
breach of implied warranties, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of Illinois statutory law. Plaintiff alleged
that Forerunner watch bands have an unacceptable rate of failure in that they detach from the watch. Plaintiff sought compensatory
and punitive damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees, and injunctive relief. On January 29, 2014 the court
dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice. On January 30, 2014, the plaintiff re-filed the lawsuit with the same claims for relief
as the earlier action and adding an additional claim for unjust enrichment.  On February 4, 2014, the court ordered the case
to be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Utah.  The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case
filed in Illinois and, on March 6, 2014, she refiled the lawsuit in the District Court for the District of Utah with the same claims,
but with additional claims for violations of the Utah Consumers Sales Practice Act, Lanham Act, and Utah Truth in Advertising Act. 
The relief she requested is the same.  On March 31, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to transfer the venue of the Utah action back
to the Northern District of Illinois.  On October 21, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of Utah denied
Garmin’s motion to transfer venue. On December 26, 2014, Garmin filed a motion to dismiss certain counts of the complaint.
On April 16, 2015 the court granted Garmin’s motion in part and dismissed with prejudice (i) Mr. Katz’s (but not Mrs.
Katz’s) claim for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, (ii) the plaintiffs’ Lanham Act claim, (iii) the
plaintiffs’ negligence claim and (iv) the plaintiffs’ negligent misrepresentation claim. No class has been certified
at this time.  Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.

Brian Meyers, on
behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, v. Garmin International, Inc. Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin Ltd.

On August 13, 2013,
Brian Meyers filed a putative class action complaint against Garmin International, Inc., Garmin USA, Inc. and Garmin Ltd. in the
United States District Court for the District of Kansas. Meyers alleges that lithium-ion batteries in certain Garmin products are
defective and alleges violations of the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, breach
of contract, unjust enrichment, breach of express warranty and also requests declaratory relief that the batteries are defective
and must be covered by Garmin’s warranties. The complaint seeks an order for class certification, a declaration that the
batteries are defective, an order of injunctive relief, payment of damages in an unspecified amount on behalf of a putative class
of all purchasers of certain Garmin products, and an award of attorneys’ fees. On September 18, 2013 the plaintiff voluntarily
dismissed Garmin Ltd. as a defendant without prejudice. On October 18, 2013 the plaintiff filed an amended class action complaint.
On November 1, 2013 the remaining Garmin defendants filed a motion to dismiss all counts of the complaint for failure to state
a claim on which relief can be granted. On January 24, 2014, the Court granted the motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part,
dismissing the count for declaratory relief and the prayer for a declaration that the batteries are defective, but allowing
the case to proceed on other substantive counts. On March 17, 2015, the plaintiff filed a motion for leave to file a second amended
complaint, and plaintiff filed his second amended complaint that same day. On April 7, 2015, Garmin filed an opposition to plaintiff’s
motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. On April 28, 2015 the court granted plaintiff’s motion for leave to
file a second amended complaint.  On May 11, 2015 the plaintiff filed a motion for class certification. On July 10, 2015 Garmin
filed its opposition to the motion for class certification. On September 11, 2015, the plaintiff filed a reply to Garmin’s
opposition to the motion for class certification. On September 24, 2015, Garmin filed a motion for leave to file a surreply.  No
class has been certified at this time, and Garmin believes that its defenses to Plaintiff’s motion for class certification
are meritorious and that no class will be certified. On November 24, 2015 Garmin filed a motion for summary judgment. On December
15, 2015 the plaintiff filed his opposition to Garmin’s summary judgment motion and on December 30, 2015 Garmin filed its
reply in support of its motion for summary judgment.  Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this
litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes
that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.


Navico Inc. And Navico Holding AS v. Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc.

On June 4, 2014 Navico
Inc. and Navico Holding AS filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma against Garmin
International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. alleging infringement of  U.S. Patents 8,300,499 (“the ’499 patent”);
8,305,840 (“the ’840 patent”); and 8,605,550 (“the ’550 patent”). On October 21, 2014, Garmin
filed its answer asserting that each asserted claim of the ‘499, ‘840, and ‘550 patents is invalid and/or not
infringed. On September 30, 2015, the court held a hearing on claim construction and the parties await the court’s claim
construction order. On December 4, 2015 Garmin filed a motion for summary judgment of invalidity on the basis that the asserted
claims of the‘840 and ‘550 patents are invalid for failure to comply with the definiteness requirements of 35 U.S.S.
§112 and that the asserted claims of ‘840 and ‘550 patents are also invalid for failure to comply with the written
description requirement of 35 U.S.C. §112 and for summary judgment of non-infringement on the basis that there is no infringement
by Garmin of the asserted claims of the ‘499 patent. Garmin also filed a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement
of all asserted patents for its second generation DownVu sonar design.  On December 4, 2015 Navico filed a motion for partial
summary judgment of infringement on the basis that Garmin infringes certain claims of the ‘840 and ‘550 patents, and
for summary judgment of validity on the basis that the asserted claims of the ‘840 patent are not anticipated by certain
prior art references and that the asserted claims of the ‘840 and ‘550 patents include an adequate written description.
On January 15, 2016 the court issued an order staying this lawsuit pending the final determination of any appeal filed with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concerning the final determination of the United States International Trade Commission
in

In the Matter of Certain Marine Sonar Imaging Devices, Including Downscan and Sidescan Devices, Products Containing the Same,
and Components Thereof.

Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would
not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in
this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit.

Pioneer Corporation
v. Iiyonet Inc.

On October 2, 2014,
Pioneer Corporation filed suit in the Tokyo District Court in Japan against Iiyonet Inc. alleging certain Garmin consumer products
infringe Japanese Patent No. 3,442,138 (the ‘138 patent).  Iiyonet Inc. is the Garmin distributor in Japan for its consumer
products.  Garmin intervened in this action on December 19, 2014, and has filed an answer asserting that the asserted claim
of the ‘138 patent is invalid and/or not infringed. On February 25, 2015, Garmin filed a request for Trial of Invalidation
for the ‘138 patent before the Japanese Patent Office.  Preparatory oral arguments were held before the Tokyo District
Court on March 9, 2015.  A second round of preparatory oral arguments was held before the Tokyo District Court on May 21,
2015.  The parties filed multiple rounds of preparatory documents with the Tokyo District Court between May 21, 2015, and
November 30, 2015.  On October 9, 2015, the Japanese Patent Office issued an Advanced Notice of Trial Decision finding that
Pioneer’s asserted claims are invalid as overbroad but not invalid due to novelty or inventive step. On December 8, 2015
the seventh round of oral arguments was held before the Tokyo District Court. The next round of oral arguments is scheduled for
February 16, 2016. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material
adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in this lawsuit are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.


Visteon Global Technologies,
Inc. and Visteon Technologies LLC v. Garmin International, Inc.

On February 10, 2010,
Visteon Global Technologies, Inc. and Visteon Technologies LLC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Michigan, Southern Division, against Garmin International, Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,544,060 (“the
‘060 patent”), U.S. Patent No. 5,654,892 (“the ‘892 patent”), U.S. Patent No. 5,832,408 (“the
‘408 patent”), U.S. Patent No 5,987,375 (“the ‘375 patent”) and U.S. Patent No 6,097,316 (“the
‘316 patent”). On May 17, 2010, Garmin filed its answer asserting that each claim of the ‘060 patent, the ‘892
patent, the ‘408 patent and the ‘375 patent is invalid and/or not infringed. On April 12, 2011, the special master
appointed by the court held a claim construction hearing. On December 12, 2011, the court issued an order adopting the special
master’s report construing the claims of the patents-in-suit. On September 14, 2012, Garmin filed with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office petitions for

ex parte

reexamination of the ‘408 patent and the ‘060 patent as being anticipated
and obvious in view of the prior art. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office subsequently granted Garmin’s requests for

ex
parte

reexaminations and initially rejected all identified claims.  On April 15, 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
issued a reexamination certificate confirming the patentability of the challenged claims of the ‘060 patent.  On September
16, 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a first reexamination certification canceling some of the challenged claims
of the ‘408 patent and confirming the patentability of other claims.  On November 30, 2012, Garmin filed motions for
summary judgment of non-infringement and/or invalidity for the ‘892, ‘316, and ‘375 patents.  Visteon filed
its own motions for summary judgment of infringement of the ‘408 patent and validity, under section 112, of the ‘375
and ‘060 patents.  On February 4, 2013, the summary judgment motions were referred to the special master for consideration. 
On May 23, 2014 the special master held a hearing on the summary judgment motions. Prior to the hearing Visteon dropped its claim
that Garmin infringes the ‘316 patent. On September 17, 2014, the special master issued a report recommending that Garmin’s
motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the ‘375 patent be granted, Visteon’s motion for summary judgment
of validity under section 112 of the ‘375 and ‘060 patents be granted, and that all other motions for summary judgment
be denied.  On March 18, 2015, the court issued an order granting Garmin’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement
of the ‘375 patent, denying Visteon’s motion for summary judgment as to the ‘408 patent, rejecting the Special
Master’s recommendation to grant Visteon’s motion for summary judgment as to the Garmin’s Section 112 defenses
and denying Visteon’s motion for summary judgment as to Garmin’s Section 112 defenses, denying Garmin’s motion
for summary judgment as to the ‘892 patent and dismissing as withdrawn Visteon’s claim of infringement of the ‘316
patent,    On November 21, 2014, Garmin filed a second request for ex parte reexamination of the ‘408 patent. 
On March 23, 2015, the U.S. Patent Office issued a non-final office action finding the challenged claims of the ‘408 patent
to be invalid and/or obvious in view of the prior art.  On August 18, 2015, the U.S. Patent Office issued a final rejection
finding claim 6 to be invalid but finding claims 4-5 to be patentable.  On December 18, 2015, Visteon appealed the final rejection
of claim 6.  The court held a pretrial conference on September 28, 2015.  At the pretrial conference, the court referred
all pending motions to the special master for consideration.  No trial date has yet been set nor has any date been set for
the special master’s review.  Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would
not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the claims in
this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.

In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
patent infringement, other intellectual property, product liability, customer claims and various other risks. It is not possible
to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters,
or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal
proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

The Company settled or resolved certain matters during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 that did
not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations,
certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the
consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified
by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including
the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed
above in Item 1A.

As previously noted,
the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events.
Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,”
“believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based
prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated
by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including,
but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating
any such forward-looking statement. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal
year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 contained 52 weeks.
Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods. Unless the context otherwise
requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd.
and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated,
dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide
provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
technology. We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, auto, and aviation markets. Our segments
offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors. However, the nature of
products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately.

Since our first products
were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of
these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its
estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


For information on each of the following
critical accounting policies and/or estimates, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are
primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.
Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our
sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.
We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject
to seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand
during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season. Our
aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of aircraft certifications
and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Cost
of Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs
are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our
products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to
leverage lower cost components. We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing
plants in Taiwan; Yangzhou, China; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to experience relatively
low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products. Our manufacturing
labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem. The Yangzhou, China facility was opened in 2015.

Sales price variability
has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the auto market
have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points. In recent years, pricing has
stabilized in auto allowing for relatively stable gross margins excluding the impact of deferred revenues and costs. The average
selling prices of our aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have historically been stable due to product mix and the
introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices. In 2014 and 2015, fitness pricing declined due to high volumes of
lower-priced activity trackers. The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of products sold could have
a significant impact on our gross profit.

Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses
consist of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries for sales, marketing and product support personnel;

·

salaries and related costs for executives and administrative
    personnel;

·

marketing, and other brand building costs;

·

accounting and legal costs;

·

information systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel and related costs; and

·

occupancy and other overhead costs.

Research and Development

The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high
technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.

We are committed to
increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing
consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue
generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates. In particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based
companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with tax incentives offered by the
Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have contributed to our relatively low effective corporate
tax rate.

Net sales decreased
2% in 2015 when compared to the year-ago period. All segments, excluding aviation, were impacted by revenues denominated in currencies
that have weakened against the U.S. Dollar. In total, it is estimated that the strong U.S. Dollar reduced revenues by approximately
$189 million, which represents 6% of revenue. Auto revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix at 37% in the fiscal
year 2015 compared to 43% in the fiscal year 2014.

Total unit sales increased
7% to 16.2 million units in 2015 from 15.1 million units in 2014. The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to fitness
and marine volumes partially offset by declines in each of the other segments.

Auto segment revenue
decreased 15% from the year-ago period, as both the contribution of amortization of previously deferred revenue declined when
compared to 2014 and volumes declined. Fitness revenues increased 16% on the strength of our wearables portfolio. Aviation revenues
increased 3% from the year-ago period as market share gains were partially offset by industry weakness. Outdoor revenues decreased
1% from the year-ago period due to geographic exposure to weak currencies and maturing product categories largely offset by the
strength of outdoor wearables. Revenues in our marine segment increased 15% as the release of new marine products drove strong
revenue growth.

The Company anticipates
revenue of approximately $2.82 billion in 2016 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by
ongoing declines in the auto segment. In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products
are essential for future revenue growth.

Cost of goods sold
increased 1% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2015 when compared to fiscal year 2014. Cost of goods as a percentage of revenue
increased in part due to a stronger U.S. Dollar that created downward pressure on revenue in all segments excluding aviation as
discussed above.

In the auto segment,
the cost of goods decline was largely consistent with the segment revenue decline. In the fitness segment, the cost of goods increase
outpaced revenue growth due to product mix and competitive pricing dynamics. The cost of goods increases in marine are due to
increased sales of higher margin products. Aviation cost of goods was lower due to product mix.


Management believes
that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be relatively consistent in 2016.

Advertising expense
increased 14% in absolute dollars while increasing 80 basis points as a percent of revenues. The increase in absolute dollars
occurred in fitness and marine to support new product introductions with increased media spend, point of sale presence at key
retailers and cooperative advertising. This was partially offset by decreased spending in auto due to reduced cooperative advertising
associated with lower volumes and in outdoor due to fewer new product categories.

Management expects advertising expense in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales to be relatively
flat in 2016.

Selling, general and
administrative expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and 100 basis points as a percent of revenues compared to fiscal year
2014. The absolute dollar increase is primarily related to litigation related costs, information technology costs and product
support. Variances by segment are primarily due to the allocation of certain selling, general and administrative expenses based
on percentage of total revenues. Marine expense growth exceeded other segments due to specific litigation matters.


Management expects
selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales in 2016 due primarily
to acquisitions.

Research and development
expense increased 8% due to ongoing development activities for new products and additional engineering personnel throughout fiscal
year 2015. In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $31.9 million when compared with fiscal year 2014 and
increased 140 basis points as a percent of revenue. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving
existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.

Management believes
that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction
of new products. Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2016 on an absolute
dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.

As a result of the
above, operating income decreased 20% in absolute dollars and 460 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to the fiscal
year 2014. Declining gross margin percentages and increases in all operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, as discussed

The average return
on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 were 1.2% and 1.3%, respectively. The decrease in interest income
is attributable to decreasing cash and investment balances and a slight decrease in the interest rates.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling in relation
to the U.S. Dollar. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation. The U.S. Dollar remains the functional
currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd. The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries. As these entities have grown,
currency fluctuations can generate material gains and losses. The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency
gain or loss results from the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables and payables held in a currency other than
the functional currency at one of the Company’s subsidiaries. Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions can also
generate currency gains and losses. Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan
Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The majority of the
$23.5 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2015 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro. The
strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain. The movements of the Taiwan Dollar
and Euro have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar
for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro transactions relate primarily to revenue. During
fiscal year 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 10.0% compared to the Euro resulting in a net loss of $31.2 million. This was largely
offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $19.5 million. The remaining
net currency loss of $11.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The majority of the
$4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the
British Pound Sterling. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain. During
fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting
in a net loss of $43.7 million. This was more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting
in a gain of $44.8 million. The remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

During fiscal year
2015, Garmin recorded other income of $11.4 million. This income was primarily due to a legal settlement received during the year
and a gain on the disposal of property.

Income Tax Provision

Our income tax expense
decreased by $248.6 million, to $111.0 million for the fiscal year 2015, from $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014.  Contributing
to the significant decrease was:

·

tax
                                         expense of $307.6 million in 2014 associated with the inter-company restructuring discussed
                                         below,

Partially offset by:

·

release
                                         of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations
                                         or completion of tax audits of $7.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to releases
                                         of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014.

In addition, the full year income mix
by tax jurisdiction for 2015 compared to 2014 is unfavorable resulting in an increased effective tax rate.

In
the third quarter of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure. 
This change in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows
us to efficiently repatriate future earnings.  As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense
of $307.6 million.

The first and second cash tax payments
of $78.1 million and $182.8 million associated with the restructuring were made in the third quarter of 2014 and the second quarter
of 2015, respectively.  The remainder of the accrued tax will be paid incrementally as the cash is repatriated.


The Company expects the effective income tax rate
to be approximately 20.5% in 2016.

Net Income

As a result of the
various factors noted above, net income increased 25% to $456.2 million for the fiscal year 2015 compared to $364.2 million for
the fiscal year 2014.

Net sales increased
9% in 2014 when compared to the year-ago period. All segments, excluding auto, grew in the fiscal year 2014. Auto revenue remains
the largest portion of our revenue mix at 43% in the fiscal year 2014 compared to 49% in the fiscal year 2013.

Total unit sales increased
9% to 15.1 million units in 2014 from 13.9 million units in 2013. The increase in unit sales volume was attributable to growth
in all segments except auto which had volume decline due to penetration rates and competing technologies.

Auto segment revenue
decreased 5% from fiscal year 2013, as a 10% volume decline and slight average selling price (ASP) decline, were partially offset
by amortization of previously deferred revenue exceeding current period revenue deferrals and increased auto OEM contributions.
Revenues in our fitness segment increased 60% from fiscal year 2013 on the strength of wellness products first introduced in 2014,
and recent biking and running product introductions. Aviation revenues increased 14% from fiscal year 2013 as both OEM market
share gains and aftermarket strength contributed to growth. Outdoor revenues increased 4% from fiscal year 2013 primarily due
to strong sales of fēnix 2 and our lineup of dog tracking and training products, offset by declining sales of our handheld
products which serve a mature industry. Revenues in our marine segment increased 11% due to both the recent acquisition of Fusion
Electronics as well as new product introductions. This growth was partially offset by a competitive pricing environment in the
global marine electronics industry.

Cost of goods sold
increased 3% in absolute dollars for fiscal year 2014 when compared to fiscal year 2013. The increase was driven by growth in
all segments excluding auto. Fitness and marine cost of goods increased in-line with sales growth as described above with gross
margins stable year-over-year. Outdoor cost of goods increased due to sales growth with gross margin contraction driven by product
mix.


As a percentage of
revenue, cost of goods sold decreased 240 basis points from fiscal year 2013 with improvement or stability in each segment, excluding
outdoor as mentioned above. The auto cost of goods improvement as a percent of revenues was primarily due to benefit from the
amortization of previously deferred revenue and costs exceeding new deferrals on current period sales in 2014. Aviation margin
improvement was primarily due to increased contribution of software sales which carry a higher margin.

The average return
on cash and investments during the fiscal years of 2014 and 2013 were 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively. The slight increase in interest
income was offset by fewer capital gains on investments in 2014, which is recorded as Other income.


The majority of the
$4.3 million currency loss in the fiscal year 2014 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the
British Pound Sterling. The strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar contributed an offsetting gain. The
movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against
the U.S. Dollar due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the
Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate primarily to revenue. During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. Dollar strengthened
11.4% compared to the Euro and 5.5% compared to the British Pound Sterling resulting in a net loss of $43.7 million. This was
more than offset as the U.S. Dollar strengthened 5.5% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a gain of $44.8 million. The
remaining net currency loss of $5.4 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The majority of the
$35.5 million currency gain in 2013 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar. The weakening
of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and British Pound Sterling contributed additional gains. During 2013, the U.S. Dollar
weakened 4.1% and 2.2%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of
$7.5 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.  The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.3% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting
in a $30.2 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.  The net result of
these currency moves combined with other losses of $2.1 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net gain
of $35.5 million for the Company.

Income Tax Provision

Our income tax expense
increased by $318.4 million, to $359.5 million for the fiscal year 2014, from $41.1 million for the fiscal year 2013.  Contributing
to the significant increase were:

·

tax
                                         expense of $307.6 million associated with the inter-company restructuring discussed above,

·

expiration
                                         of certain Taiwan tax holidays and

·

research
                                         and development tax credits of $6.3 million related to 2012 which were recognized when
                                         the related legislation was enacted in January 2013.

Partially offset by favorable impacts including:

·

release
                                         of uncertain tax position reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations
                                         or completion of tax audits of $83.9 million in fiscal year 2014 compared to releases
                                         of $79.9 million in fiscal year 2013.

Net Income

As a result of the
various factors noted above, net income decreased 41% to $364.2 million for the fiscal year 2014 compared to $612.4 million for
fiscal year 2013.

The $242.2 million decrease in cash provided
by operating activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:

·

the
                                         impact of income tax payable providing $247.0 million less cash due primarily to the
                                         timing of disbursements related to the inter-company restructuring

·

other
                                         current and noncurrent assets providing $108.0 million less cash primarily due to prepayments
                                         of royalties and timing of payments for insurance


·

the
                                         impact of deferred income taxes providing $83.9 million less cash primarily due to the
                                         timing of withholding taxes paid and

·

inventories
                                         and related provisions for obsolete and slow moving inventories providing $47.9 million
                                         less cash primarily due to additional safety stock of specific raw materials and continued
                                         growth in products offered

Partially offset by:

·

·

accounts
                                         receivable providing $49.9 million more cash primarily due to the impact of lower revenues
                                         and associated decline in receivables

·

the
                                         impact of increasing unrealized foreign currency losses providing $37.4 million less
                                         cash due to the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations as discussed in the Results
                                         of Operations section above

·

deferred
                                         revenue/costs providing $32.6M more working capital benefit due to the decreased amortization
                                         of previously deferred revenue/cost as discussed in the Results of Operations section
                                         above and

·

accounts
                                         payable providing $27.1 million more cash primarily due to the timing of payments

The $107.4 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities
in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:

·

net
                                         income decreasing by $248.2 million, including the $307.6 million tax expense related
                                         to the inter-company restructuring, as discussed in the Results of Operations section
                                         above

·

accounts
                                         receivable providing $66.0 million less cash primarily due to the increasing sales in
                                         fourth quarter 2014 and timing of collections

·

deferred
                                         revenue/costs providing $58.2 million less working capital benefit due to the increased
                                         amortization of previously deferred revenue/cost as discussed in the Results of Operations
                                         section above and

·

inventories,
                                         net providing $53.9 million less cash primarily due to new product categories and increasing
                                         product demand partially offset by increased reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventories

Partially offset by:

·

income
                                         taxes payable providing $130.2 million more cash due to the timing of disbursements primarily
                                         related to the inter-company restructuring offset by the release of uncertain tax position
                                         reserves due to expiration of certain statutes of limitations or completion of tax
                                         audits

·

the
                                         impact of deferred income taxes providing $81.9 million more cash due primarily to timing
                                         of disbursements partially related to the inter-company restructuring in addition to
                                         the reclassification of withholding taxes from current taxes payable.

·

other
                                         current and non-current liabilities providing $48.2 million more cash due to timing of
                                         payments related to royalties and advertising

·

the
                                         impact of increasing unrealized foreign currency losses providing $40.7 million more
                                         cash due primarily to foreign currency rate fluctuations related to our Taiwan operations
                                         which utilize the Taiwan Dollar as their functional currency and specific European operations
                                         which utilize the Euro as their functional currency resulting in translation of assets
                                         and liabilities to U.S. Dollar

·

other
                                         current and noncurrent assets providing $22.6 million more cash primarily due to timing
                                         of payments associated with advertising and sponsorships


We expect to generate $475 million of cash flow from operations
in 2016 with ongoing net income.

The $405.8 million increase in cash provided
by investing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:

·

collection
                                         of cash advanced under a loan receivable commitment with Bombardier of $137.4 million
                                         in the current year period compared to a cash advance of the same amount in the prior
                                         year period and

·

increased
                                         net redemptions of marketable securities of $165.9 million

Partially offset by:

increased
                                         cash payments for intangible assets of $3.6 million

We have budgeted approximately
$75 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 to include some facility expansion, along with normal ongoing capital expenditures
and maintenance activities. It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin’s investment
policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital,
maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average
return on cash and investments during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013 were approximately 1.2%, 1.3%, and 1.4%, respectively.

The Company’s
investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the
underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Footnote 3 for additional
information regarding marketable securities.

The $99.5 million
decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 was primarily due to the following:

·

decreased
                                         purchase of treasury stock of $110.2 million under a share repurchase authorization

Partially offset by:

·

increased
                                         dividend payments of $18.0 million due to the increase in our year-over-year dividend
                                         rate

The $192.8 million increase in cash used
in financing activities in fiscal year 2014 compared to fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to the following:

·

increased
                                         purchase of treasury stock of $183.2 million under a share repurchase authorization and

·

increased
                                         dividend payments of $8.4 million due to the increased dividend per share that was effective
                                         beginning in the second calendar quarter of 2014

Our dividend has progressively
increased from $0.45 per share for the eight calendar quarters beginning in June 2012 to $0.48 per share for the four calendar
quarters beginning in June 2014 to $0.51 per share for the four quarters beginning in June 2015.

We currently use cash
flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends. We expect
that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share
repurchases and the funding of strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations
will be sufficient to meet our long-term projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements.

The Company is party
to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income
housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.  The aggregate amount
of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2015 was approximately $278.3 million. We cannot determine the
aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations
to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within
short periods of time.

We may be required
to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future
cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of
cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $97.9 million as of
December 26, 2015, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized
tax benefits, see Note 2, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk
primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw
materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns,
we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining
price reductions in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We do not believe
that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become
subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our
inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The operation of Garmin’s
subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant
foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically
hedged its foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The currencies that
create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Garmin
Corporation, headquartered in Xizhi, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets
and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize
the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s
cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

Most European subsidiaries
use the Euro as the functional currency

.

The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd.
remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses
have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company believes
that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows. In 2015, the U.S. Dollar strengthened
10.0% relative to the Euro resulting in a foreign currency loss of $31.2 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries. 
The U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a $19.5 million foreign currency gain due to the fluctuation
of asset balances throughout the year.  The net result of these currency moves combined with other losses of $11.8 million,
and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $23.5 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment
of $35.0 million during the fiscal year 2015.

We assessed the Company’s
exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and
the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than respective functional currencies as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse
changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before
income taxes of approximately $95 million and $118 million at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.


Interest Rate Risk

We have no outstanding
long-term debt as of December 26, 2015. We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are exposed to
interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains
and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.

The Company’s investment policy
requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company
does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be
required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. During 2015 and 2014,
the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.

We assessed the Company’s
exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding
impact to the Company’s portfolio of marketable securities. Based on balance sheet positions as of December 26, 2015 and
December 27, 2014, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all maturities
would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $43 million and $52 million at December 26, 2015
and December 27, 2014. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Garmin Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
26, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries at December 26,
2015 and December 27, 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 26, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December
26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

GARMIN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In Thousands, Except Share and Per
Share Information)

December 26, 2015 and December 27,

1. Description of the Business

Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries
(together, the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based,
portable and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and
sensor-based products. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s
products to the Company’s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in the Americas region and for most of the Company’s research and new product development. GII also manufactures
most of the Company’s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing
of the Company’s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL’s sales are to other Company-owned
distributors in the EMEA region.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year

The Company has adopted
a 52–53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks
in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each
calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal
years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.

In those resulting
fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore,
the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the
prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013 included
52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Foreign Currency

Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries
utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by the

Foreign Currency
Matters

topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements
of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the
reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and
at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of ($14,108) and $20,874 as of December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively,
have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.


Transactions in foreign
currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these
transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and
Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts when the currencies move congruently against the U.S. Dollar due to the use
of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling
transactions relate primarily to revenue. All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange (losses)
gains of ($23,465), ($4,299), and $35,538, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
The loss in fiscal 2015 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro partially offset by the USD strengthening
against the Taiwan Dollar. The loss in fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling which was largely offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. The gain in fiscal 2013 was due primarily
to the strengthening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar and the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per
share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings
per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number
of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s
stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 10.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short
maturity of those instruments.

Trade Accounts Receivable

The Company sells
its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s
financial condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within
80 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing
its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful
in collecting the amount due. The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company grants
credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not
require security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements and typically have been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended terms
consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales
variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.


The Company’s
top ten customers have contributed between 22% and 24% of net sales since 2013. None of the Company’s customers accounted
for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013.

Loan Receivable

On March 14, 2013,
the Company entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Bombardier, Inc. (“Bombardier”). 
The Company is the supplier of the avionics system for the Lear 70 and Lear 75 aircraft for Learjet, Inc., which is a subsidiary
of Bombardier (the “Program”).  In order to assist Bombardier in connection with delayed cash flows from the
Program partially related to the certification of avionics for the Program exceeding the planned delivery date, the Company agreed
to provide Bombardier a short term, interest free, loan of $173,708 in cash in seven installments beginning on March 22, 2013
and ending on September 20, 2013 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.  Bombardier repaid the loan in five
installments beginning in November 2013 and ending in April 2014 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and subsequent
amendment signed December 6, 2013.

Inventories

Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Garmin writes down its inventory
for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those
projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required. Inventories consisted of the following:

Long-Lived Assets

As required by the

Property, Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived
asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

The

Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other

topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2015,
2014, or 2013.  The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated
useful lives and reviewed for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives
over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.

Dividends

Under Swiss corporate law,

dividends
must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company’s shareholders.

On June 5, 2015, the
shareholders approved a dividend of $2.04 per share (of which, $1.02 was paid in the Company's 2015 fiscal year) payable in four
equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:

The Company paid dividends
in 2013 in the amount of $351,707. Both the dividend paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained
earnings.


Approximately $304,674
and $290,955 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan
at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.

Intangible Assets

At December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and
other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $216,465 and $191,034, respectively. Identifiable, finite-lived
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years, which represents
the expected pattern and duration of use of and benefit received from the respective assets. Accumulated amortization was $158,704
and $151,589 at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $7,115,
$8,362 and $17,847, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively. In the next
five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $19,780, $7,506, $6,734, $4,787 and $3,610, respectively.

The Company’s
excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $187,791 at December 26, 2015 and $178,638 at December
27, 2014.

Marketable Securities

Management determines
the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date.

All of the Company’s
marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 26, 2015. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair
value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain (loss). At December 26, 2015 and
December 27, 2014, cumulative unrealized gains and losses, net of tax of ($16,321) and ($18,303), respectively, were reported
in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.

Investments are reviewed
periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary. If investments
are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.

Testing for impairment
of investments requires significant management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination
of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.
The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments
are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.


The amortized cost
of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest
income from investments. Realized gains and losses, and credit declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included
in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Investments are discussed
in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts
for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

. The liability method
provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to
the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company adopted
the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

related to accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.  We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the
U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If payment
of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized
in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.

Income taxes are discussed
in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

Garmin recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped
and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products
and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone
sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 
The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

For multiple-element
arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and
undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to
all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy
to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (TPE), and (iii) best estimate of the selling
price (ESP).  VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more than a limited basis,
at prices within a relatively narrow range.  In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other
products including mobile applications, in-dash navigation solutions, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve
multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.

Garmin offers PNDs
with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price.  LMUs enable customers to download the latest map
and point of interest information for the useful life of their PND.  In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with traffic service
bundled in the original purchase price.  The Company has identified multiple deliverables contained in arrangements involving
the sale of PNDs which include the LMU and/or traffic service.  The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software
essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale.  The remaining deliverables are the
LMU and/or traffic service.  The Company has allocated revenue between these deliverables using the relative selling price
method.  Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale
provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated
to the LMU and/or the traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the products.


The Company has determined
sufficient VSOE does not exist for LMU or traffic, and that third party evidence of selling price is not available.  During
2013, the Company estimated selling price of the undelivered element based on the relative selling price method using a weighted
average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled PND units, and the royalty or subscription
cost plus a normal margin. These estimates were reflective of how the Company established product pricing based in part on customer
perception of value of the added LMU or traffic service capability to the PND.  In 2014, the Company determined that stand-alone
and unbundled unit sales no longer occurred on more than a limited basis, and therefore began using the royalty cost plus a normal
margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative selling prices of the undelivered elements.

Garmin records estimated
reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product
discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases),
promotions and other volume-based incentives.  The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical
experience and expectation of future conditions.  Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating
results.   These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other
promotions, accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.   If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions
to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive
is offered.

The Company records
revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.  The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns
are based on Garmin’s historical experience.

Deferred Revenues
and Costs

At December 26, 2015
and December 27, 2014, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $293,713 and $338,728 , respectively, and related deferred costs
totaling $87,945 and $87,476, respectively.

The deferred revenues
and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to five years on a straight-line basis. In the next five years,
the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $115,806, $60,971,
$21,467, $5,356 and $2,168, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling
costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Product Warranty

The Company provides
for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally
provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged
or defective.  The Company’s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled
within 5 months from time of sale.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period
of one to two years from date of shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of
installation

.

The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience
and expectations of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.  To the extent Garmin experiences
increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase,
resulting in decreased gross profit. The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty
reserve:

.

Sales Programs

The Company provides
certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing
volume and growth. Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products. Estimated rebates
and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older
products from their inventories in advance of new product releases. Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied
to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis. These
rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
in the period the Company has sold the product.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses
advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $167,166, $146,633, and $112,905, for the years ended
December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and December 28, 2013, respectively.

Research and Development

A majority of the
Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are expensed
as incurred, amounted to approximately $427,043, $395,121, and $364,923, for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014
and December 28, 2013, respectively.

Customer Service
and Technical Support

Customer
service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing,
answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical
support assistance to customers. The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized.
The related cost of providing this free support is not material.


Software Development Costs

The FASB ASC topic
entitled

Software

requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility
has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.
As required by the

Research and Development

topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after
the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and
development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company currently
sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled

Compensation – Stock Compensation

requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and
directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values.

Accounting guidance
requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.
The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As stock-based compensation
expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they
have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and
revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based
on historical experience and management’s estimates.

Stock compensation
plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014,
the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU
2014-09”), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 requires that a company will recognize
revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring
goods or services to a customer. In applying the new guidance, a company will (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer;
(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction
price to the contract’s performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a
performance obligation. The new standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or in a modified
retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect will be recognized as of the date of adoption.

In August 2015, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of the new guidance by one year such that
the new provisions will now be required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial statements.


In January 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition,
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard
on its consolidated financial statements.

3. Marketable Securities

The FASB ASC topic
entitled

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted
                                         prices in active markets for identical assets or liability

Level 2

Observable inputs
                                         for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for
                                         similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
                                         assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices
                                         that are observable for the asset or liability

Level 3

Unobservable
                                         inputs for the asset or liability

The Company endeavors
to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation methods used by the Company
for each significant class of investments are summarized below.

Mortgage-backed securities,
corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions – Valued based on prices obtained from an independent
pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar
assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows,
benchmark yields, and credit spreads.

Common stocks – Valued
at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.

The methods described
above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different
fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Certain available-for-sale securities
                                         held as of December 27, 2014 have been reclassified among major security types to conform
                                         to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on fair value
                                         measurement.

The Company’s
investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the
underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. The Company does not intend
to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company
will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.

The Company recognizes
the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities in "Other Income" and the noncredit component
in "Other comprehensive income (loss)" for those securities that we do not intend to sell and for which it is not more
likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery. In 2013, the Company experienced unrealized, noncredit losses
on its investment portfolio resulting in gross other-than-temporary impairment and other unrealized losses on marketable securities. During 2014 and 2015, the Company did not record any material impairment changes on its outstanding securities.

The amortized cost
and estimated fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 26, 2015 were $1,299,856 and $1,281,150,
respectively. Approximately 63.6% of securities in the Company’s portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December
26, 2015. We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered. We do not consider these unrealized
losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no deterioration in credit quality and no change in the
cash flows of the underlying securities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not
that the Company will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statement of income.

The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.

Certain
available- for-sale securities held as of December 27, 2014 have been reclassified amount major security types to confirm to the
current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on fair value measurement.

The amortized cost
and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 26, 2015, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities
will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without
prepayment penalties.

4. Commitments and Contingencies

Rental expense related
to office, equipment, warehouse space and real estate amounted to $18,104, $19,559 and $18,721 for the years ended December 26,
2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively. The Company recognizes rental expense on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.

Future minimum lease
payments are as follows:

Certain cash balances
of GEL and GC are held as collateral by banks securing payment of local value-added tax requirements.  The total amount of
restricted cash balances were $259 and $308 at December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.

The Company is party
to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, advertising expenditures, investments in certain low income
housing tax credit projects, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.  The aggregate amount
of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 26, 2015 was approximately $278,327. We cannot determine the aggregate
amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to
purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within
short periods of time.


In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations, and complaints, including matters
involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims.  The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments
in legal proceedings, investigations or claims that could affect the amount of any accrual or disclosure. The assessment regarding
whether a loss is probable or a reasonable possibility, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a
series of complex judgments about future events.

Management of the
Company currently does not believe there is at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or
a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies individually and in the aggregate, for the
fiscal year ended December 26, 2015. The results of legal proceeding, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted
with certainty. Although management considers the likelihood to be remote, an adverse resolution of one of more of such matters
in excess of management’s expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations
in a particular quarter or fiscal year.

The Company settled or resolved certain matters during the fiscal year ended December 26, 2015 that did
not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

5. Employee Benefit Plans

GII and the
Company’s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their
employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to
which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits
as defined in the retirement plan. Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute
up to 7.5% of their annual compensation. In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined
annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and
December 28, 2013, expense related to these and other defined contribution plans of $37,489, $29,267 and $26,839,
respectively, was charged to operations.

Certain of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider
final pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014 and
December 28, 2013, were significant.

In the third quarter
of 2014, the Company initiated an inter-company restructuring that realigned our corporate entity structure.  This change
in corporate structure provides access to historical earnings that were previously permanently reinvested and allows us to efficiently
repatriate future earnings.  As a result of the change in corporate structure, Garmin recorded tax expense of $307,635. Approximately
$263,000 of this amount has been paid.  The remainder of the accrued tax is expected to be paid incrementally as the cash
is repatriated.

The holding company statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation
since the Redomestication effective June 27, 2010, is 7.83%.  If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company
federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax for 2015 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory
rate would be $154,000 lower, or $44,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to $52,000.
For 2014, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $197,000 lower, or $57,000, and the foreign tax
rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $44,000. For 2013, the amount related to tax at the statutory
rate would be approximately $178,000 lower, or $51,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to
approximately $64,000. All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.


The Company’s
income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $403,242, $546,790, and $502,423, for the years ended December
26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively. The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above
reflect $0.02, $0.02, and $0.03 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 26, 2015, December
27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively. The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through
2017, at which time these tax benefits will likely expire.

Income taxes of $21,085,
$20,606, and $307,990 at December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively, have not been accrued by the
Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested
in the subsidiaries indefinitely. These balances decreased in 2014 as a result of the inter-company restructuring which reduced
the amount of earnings reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.

Deferred income taxes
reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities
are as follows:

The stock options outstanding related to
the deferred tax asset of $35,360 will begin to expire over the next several years. Given the exercise price of the options expiring
over the next 12 months compared to the current market price it is possible that these options will expire unexercised, resulting
in a potential write-off of $6,000 that would reduce the deferred tax asset and reduce equity.


In November 2015, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (“ASU 2015-17”),
requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified as non-current on the
balance sheet, which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The standard is effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is
permitted, and the Company elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard as of December 26, 2015. Prior periods in our
Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted.

At December 26, 2015,
the Company had $3,906 of tax credit carryover compared to $2,726 at December 27, 2014. The surtax credit carryover from 2013
of $52,618 was adjusted and subsequently fully utilized in 2014 upon the execution of the inter-company restructuring. In turn,
the entire valuation allowance regarding the surtax credit was released.

At December 26, 2015,
the Company had a deferred tax asset of $5,228 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of
$19,580.  Included in the NOL carryforwards is $7,092 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022 and
2027, $338 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2022, $4,238 related to the Netherlands and expires in varying amounts between
2017 and 2022, $1,317 that relates to Finland and expires in 2025, $1,300 that relates to the United States and expires in 2035,
and $5,295 that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance
for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to
be realized. In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more
or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is
made.

The total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2015 was $97,904.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013 is as follows:

Accounting guidance
requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be
paid within one year of the balance sheet date.  The entire balance of net unrecognized benefits of $93,654, $74,205 and
$125,918 are required to be classified as non-current at December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014, and December 28, 2013, respectively.
The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate. None of the unrecognized tax benefits are
due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.

Interest and penalties,
if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.  At December 26, 2015, December 27,
2014, and December 28, 2013, the Company had accrued approximately $2,479, $2,159, and $5,111, respectively, for interest. 
The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 26, 2015, December
27, 2014, and December 28, 2013 by $320, ($2,953), and ($3,111), respectively. The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties
as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.


The Company files income
tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  With
few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years
2012 and prior.  The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2009 and
prior.  The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2012 and prior.
The Company is subject to Switzerland income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2011 through 2015.

The Company recognized
a reduction of income tax expense of $6,971, $83,006, and $74,217 in fiscal years ended December 26, 2015, December 27, 2014,
and December 28, 2013, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement
in various jurisdictions.

The Company believes that
it is reasonably possible that approximately $5,000 to 10,000 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease
within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations. This potential decrease in unrecognized
tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months

7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As required by the

Financial Instruments

topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain
financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments are held
or issued for trading purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities,
the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

8. Segment Information

The Company has identified
five reportable segments for external reporting purposes – auto, aviation, marine, outdoor and fitness. There are two operating
segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment. Each operating
segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses
performance of each segment individually.

All of the Company’s
reportable segments offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through
OEMs. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary. The Company’s
marine, auto, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily
to retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s aviation
products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily
to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.


The Company’s Chief
Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM. In 2015, the measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM to assess segment
performance and allocate resources changed from income before income taxes to operating income. This change did not impact the
measurement methods used to determine reported segment profit or loss in the years ended December 26, 2015 and December 27, 2014.
Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses, including certain allocated general and
administrative costs. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The Company’s
reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business. Thus, the Company
does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment
to the CODM.

Revenues, gross profit,
and operating income for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented below:

9. Stock Compensation
Plans

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below. For all stock compensation plans, the
company’s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU)
releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases.

2011 Non-employee Directors’
Equity Incentive Plan

In June 2011, the stockholders
adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the “2011 Directors Plan”) providing for grants of stock
options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance. The term of
each award cannot exceed ten years. Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, 12,008, 7,120, and
11,484, restricted stock units were granted under this plan.

2005 Equity Incentive
Plan

In June 2005, the
shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and
nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant
to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional
3,000,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 13,000,000. Option and SAR grants vest evenly
over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally
expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised. RSUs granted prior to December 10, 2012 vested or are vesting
evenly over a period of five years, while RSUs granted on and after that date vest evenly over a period of three years. In
addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU grants is also contingent upon the achievement of
certain revenue and profitability goals. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, 1,171,905, 425,347, and 413,978 RSUs were granted under
the 2005 Plan. No SARs were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2015. During 2014 and 2013, 47,095 and 52,673 SARs were granted
under the 2005 plan.


2000 Equity Incentive
Plan

In October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000 Plan”) providing
for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and SARs vest evenly
over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire
ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised. The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2015, 2014,
or 2013.

2000 Non-employee Directors’
Option Plan

Also in October 2000, the
stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “2000 Directors Plan”) providing for grants
of options for up to 100,000 common shares. In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making
the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over a three-year
period. Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares
under this plan.

Stock-Based Compensation
Activity

A summary of the Company’s
stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the

The weighted-average remaining
contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2015 is 1.81 and 1.67 years, respectively.
The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 26, 2015 was 1.54 years.

The fair value of awards
is determined at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is calculated using the
closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of estimated dividends over
the vesting period, which are not accrued. The fair value of stock options and SARs was calculated with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2014 and 2013. No options or SARs were granted in 2015.

The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility.

The total fair value of
awards vested during 2015, 2014, and 2013 was $23,351, $19,127, and $20,956, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of options
and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2015 were $207 and $207, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of
options and SARs exercised during 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $3,714, $18,885, and $13,114 respectively. The aggregate intrinsic
value of RSUs outstanding at December 26, 2015 was $61,259. The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2015, 2014,
and 2013, were $20,787, $28,119, and $27,007 respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable
number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company’s closing stock price
on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards
multiplied by the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period. The Company’s
closing stock price was $36.98 on December 26, 2015. As of December 26, 2015, there was $52,590 of total unrecognized compensation
cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is
expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The shareholders also adopted an ESPP. Up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the
ESPP with shareholders approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in June 2015. Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal
to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first
day of the ESPP period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the
Internal Revenue Code. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, 488,753, 349,982, and 395,220, shares, respectively were purchased under the
plan for a total purchase price of $16,789, $14,634, and $12,181, respectively. During 2015, 2014, and 2013, the purchases were
issued from treasury shares. At December 26, 2015, approximately 2,000,628 shares were available for future issuance.

excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years of 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, because
the effect would have been anti-dilutive.

11. Share Repurchase Plan

On February 13, 2015,
the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares
through December 31, 2016.  Under the plan, the Company repurchased 3,148,901 shares using cash of $131,413 in fiscal 2015.

On February 15, 2013,
the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares
through December 31, 2014.  Under the plan, the Company repurchased 1,376,500 shares using cash of $58,422 in fiscal 2013
and 4,369,360 shares using cash of $241,578 in fiscal 2014.

14. Subsequent Events

On January 13, 2016, Garmin
International, Inc. acquired PulsedLight, Inc., a privately-held designer of optical distance measurement technology based in
Bend, Oregon. This acquisition was not material.

On February 11, 2016,
Garmin Ltd. announced the signing of a purchase agreement to acquire DeLorme, a privately-held company that designs and markets
consumer based satellite tracking devices with two-way communication and navigational capabilities based in Yarmouth, Maine. This
acquisition is not expected to be material.

In 2016, the Company
plans to move action camera related revenues and expenses from the Outdoor segment to the Auto segment allowing for alignment
and synergies with other camera-based efforts occurring within the Auto segment. The Company will recast 2014 and 2015 segment results on a quarterly basis for comparability purposes.


Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a) Conclusion Regarding
the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b) Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s assessment
of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1
and 32.2.

Management of the Company
assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015. In making
this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013 framework).

Based on such assessment
and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 26, 2015.

Ernst & Young LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an
attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 26, 2015, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.


(c) Attestation
Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Garmin Ltd.

and Subsidiaries

We have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’ internal control
over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries as of December
26, 2015 and December 27, 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2015 of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and our report
dated February 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(d) Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 26, 2015 that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
