CAUTIONARY
      STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FORWARD-LOOKING COMMENTS

The
      discussions set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain statements
      concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements are based
      upon assumptions by the Company's management, as of the date of this Annual
      Report, including assumptions about risks and uncertainties faced by the
      Company. In addition, management may make forward-looking statements orally
      or
      in other writings, including, but not limited to, in press releases, in the
      annual report to shareholders and in the Company’s other filings with the
      Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers can identify these forward-looking
      statements by their use of such verbs as “expects”, “anticipates”, “believes” or
      similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. Forward-looking statements include
      any discussion of the trends and other factors that drive our business and
      future results in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
      Conditions and Results of Operation.” Readers are cautioned not to place undue
      reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their
      date.
      If any of management's assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated
      circumstances arise, the Company's actual results could materially differ from
      those anticipated by such forward-looking statements. The differences could
      be
      caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not
      limited to, those factors identified under Item 1A “Risk Factors”. Readers are
      strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any
      forward-looking statements concerning the Company. The Company does not
      undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report to
      reflect future events or developments.

Company
      Overview

Garmin
      is
      a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
      devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System (“GPS”)
      technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse family
      of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other
      navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile,
      outdoor/fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.


Overview
      of the Global Positioning System

The
      Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the
      precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
      technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites.
      The
      satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained
      and
      operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing
      satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.
      Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.

Prior
      to
      May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy
      of
      civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (‘‘SA’’) for
      national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a
      radius of 100 meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense
      discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004,
      the
      Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA
      again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial
      of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS
      receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters
      or
      less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The
      accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques
      which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
      to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a
      Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’) comprising ground reference stations
      and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available
      in the United States and portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3
      meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
      and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased
      accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers
      for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS
      system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was
      available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics
      equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference
      stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Recent
      Developments in the Company’s Business

Since
      the
      inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 19 million products, which
      includes the delivery of over 5.4 million products during 2006.

Automotive/Mobile
      Product Introductions

Garmin
      launched many new products in 2006. Among these were new versions of Garmin’s
      popular

nüvi

™

Personal
      Travel Assistant™ product line. The nüvi family was expanded in 2006 to include
      the nüvi 360 and the nüvi 660. The nüvi 360 adds Bluetooth™ wireless capability
      to the nüvi’s already full feature set of a high-sensitivity GPS receiver,
      language translator, MP3 player, audio book player, currency and measurement
      converter, world clock and digital photo organizer. The nüvi 660 incorporates a
      wider and brighter touchscreen, an integrated traffic receiver and an integrated
      FM transmitter.

Garmin
      also introduced several new versions of its StreetPilot

®

line of
      personal navigation devices (PNDs) in 2006. The StreetPilot c-Series

™

line was
      expanded with the c500 series (c510, c530, and c550 models), which built upon
      the success of the c300 series by adding several new features, including
      Bluetooth™ wireless technology, an integrated traffic-detection receiver, a
      brighter display, a high-sensitivity GPS receiver, an MP3 player, and optional
      (purchased separately) Garmin Travel Guide™ functionality - giving users reviews
      and recommendations for restaurants, hotels, shopping, nightlife, sporting
      events, and tourist attractions. The StreetPilot 2700 series was also updated
      with the introduction of the StreetPilot 2820, a premium navigation device
      which
      adds Bluetooth™ wireless connectivity and other upgrades to the features of the
      2700 series. Garmin also introduced the

zūmo

™
in
      2006, a navigator designed specifically for the motorcycle market with such
      features as left-handed controls, a high-bright display, Bluetooth™
“hands-free-to-helmet” wireless technology capability, and a rugged locking
      mount.


Garmin
      continued its expansion in the rental car market in 2006 by announcing
      agreements to supply GPS navigation devices to Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Avis
      Rent
      A Car and Budget Rent A Car.

Garmin
      also expanded its Garmin Mobile™ service and family of products in 2006.
      Building upon its September 2005 launch of Garmin Mobile -- a subscription-based
      navigation service for select mobile phones and providers -- Garmin added the
      availability of new dynamic content for Garmin Mobile (including fuel prices,
      weather conditions and forecasts, and traffic information) and later announced
      that Garmin Mobile would be available on select BlackBerry devices, in addition
      to certain Sprint and Nextel handsets.

Garmin
      also introduced Garmin Mobile 20, an automotive navigation system that delivers
      Garmin’s voice-prompted, turn-by-turn directions using Bluetooth wireless
      technology on Nokia, Windows Mobile and Treo 650 Smartphones, and

Garmin
      Mobile 10

,

a
      product that turns Bluetooth enabled devices such as laptops, smartphones,
      Pocket PCs (personal computers), and PDAs (personal data assistants) into GPS
      navigators.

Outdoor/Fitness
      Product Introductions

In
      the
      category of GPS-enabled fitness products, Garmin began selling its next
      generation Forerunner® products in 2006: the Forerunner 205 and Forerunner 305.
      The wrist-worn Forerunner 205 and 305 fitness products were redesigned from
      the
      first generation Forerunners to maximize GPS satellite reception and to provide
      a sleeker design. To help promote the release of the new Forerunner products,
      Garmin helped sponsor more than a dozen marathons and cycling events in 2006
      and
      early 2007.

Marine
      Product Introductions

Garmin
      introduced several new marine radar products in 2006 and, in November 2006,
      we
      introduced a new and completely redesigned line of marine chartplotters, sonar,
      and combination units for the 2007 boating season. These new marine products
      offer a new “flat screen” design, a new user interface, satellite
      photo-generated cartography, and other new features.

Aviation
      Product Introductions

Garmin’s
      G1000 integrated avionics suite received Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)
      certification in September 2006 for incorporation into Cessna’s Citation Mustang
      very light jet.

In
      November 2006, Garmin’s GNS 400/500 panel-mount avionics products received the
      FAA’s TSO C146a Gamma-3 certification, which enables pilots to fly
      Lateral-Precision with Vertical (LPV) guidance approaches and receive GPS
      navigation via the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).

Garmin
      also introduced the GPSMAP 496 aviation handheld product as an upgrade to the
      GPSMAP 396.

Expansion
      of Facilities

In
      October 2006, Garmin’s United Kingdom subsidiary acquired a building in Totton,
      Southampton, England to serve as the new headquarters for Garmin (Europe) Ltd.,
      Garmin’s United Kingdom subsidiary. The facility contains building space of
      approximately 155,000 sq. ft, including more than 129,000 sq. ft of warehouse
      space, which will serve as the European headquarters for distribution,
      marketing, and product support.


In
      February 2006, Garmin’s Taiwan subsidiary acquired a 223,469 sq. ft. facility in
      Jhongli, Taiwan, which now serves as our second manufacturing facility for
      consumer products.

Chicago
      Retail Store

In
      November 2006, Garmin opened its first retail store which is located in
      Chicago’s North Michigan Avenue shopping district. The store is intended to
      serve as a showcase for Garmin’s broad range of products.

Acquisitions

In
      November 2006, Garmin acquired Dynastream Innovations Inc., a Canadian company
      specializing in the field of personal monitoring technology - such as foot
      pods
      and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products - and a provider of
      wireless connectivity solutions for a wide range of applications. Dynastream’s
      products address the needs of a broad spectrum of fitness consumers and are
      expected to complement Garmin’s fitness products.

Two-For-One
      Stock Split

Garmin’s
      shareholders approved a two-for-one stock split on July 21, 2006, which was
      effective on August 15, 2006.

Competition

The
      market for navigation, communications and information products is highly
      competitive. Garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the
      market for its products are design, functionality, quality and reliability,
      customer service, brand, price, time-to-market and availability. Garmin believes
      that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas.

Garmin
      believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are
      TomTom NV, Magellan Navigation, Inc. (“Magellan”), Alpine Electronics, Inc.,
      Navman, Mio Technology Ltd. and Sony Corporation. Garmin believes that its
      principal competitors for handheld recreational product lines are Magellan
      and
      Lowrance Electronics, Inc. (“Lowrance”) For marine chartplotter products, Garmin
      believes that its principal competitors are Raymarine Ltd. (“Raymarine”), Furuno
      Electronic Company (“Furuno”), Navman, the Standard Vertex Division of Yaesu Co.
      Ltd. (“Standard”), and Simrad Yachting AS. For Garmin’s fishfinder/depth sounder

Research
      and Development

Garmin’s
      product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and
      development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and
      manufacturing teams. Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and
      development staff, which numbered 970 people worldwide as of December 31, 2006.
      Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work
      closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and
      manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s development staff includes
      industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers,
      mechanical engineers and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial
      design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success. Once a
      development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is
      created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.

Below
      is
      a table of Garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three
      fiscal years.

Manufacturing
      and Operations

Garmin
      believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability
      at
      its Shijr and Jhongli, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and
      its
      Salem, Oregon facility. Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach
      has provided it the following benefits:

Reduced
      time-to-market.

Utilizing
      concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s products are introduced to
      production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by
      manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.
      In
      this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product
      from
      its design phase to mass production deliveries, with improved quality and
      yields. Reducing time to market has enabled Garmin to offer several industry
      firsts, such as the Rino GPS-enabled Family Radio Service/General Mobile Radio
      Service two-way radio, the iQue 3600a portable digital assistant with integrated
      GPS and mapping, and the GNS 430, which integrates traditional aviation
      navigation and communications systems with GPS in a single package.

Design
      and process optimization.

Garmin
      uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products
      and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, lower cost and better
      value
      for customers. Garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and
      manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to
      minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and
      rugged.


Logistical
      agility.

Operating
      its own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as
      component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the
      electronics industry. Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component
      shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.
      Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a
      safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one
      product line to another.

Garmin’s
      design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan,
      and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001-2000, an international quality
      standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.
      Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved TS 16949:2002
      certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. In addition,
      Garmin’s aviation panel-mount products are designed and manufactured according
      to processes which are approved and monitored by the FAA.

In
      January 2007, Garmin’s Taiwan facilities also achieved certification of their
      environmental management systems to the ISO14001:1994 standard. This
      certification recognizes that Garmin’s Taiwan subsidiary has systems and
      processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment
      and
      to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Garmin
      purchases components for its products from a number of suppliers around the
      world. For certain components, Garmin relies on sole source suppliers. The
      failure of our suppliers to deliver components in sufficient quantities and
      in a
      timely manner could adversely affect our business.

Seasonality

Our
      sales
      are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer
      products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during
      the
      spring and summer marine season and the Father’s Day/graduation buying season,
      and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying
      season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the
      release of new products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal
      variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products
      when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

Our
      sales
      are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between
      order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
      material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders
      within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual
      Property

Our
      success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary
      technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
      secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect
      our
      proprietary rights. As of February 26, 2007, we held 291 U.S. patents and 13
      foreign patents. As of February 26, 2007, we had 190 U.S. patent applications
      and 26 foreign patent applications pending. In addition, Garmin often relies
      on
      licenses of intellectual property for use in its business. For example, Garmin
      obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products
      from
      various sources. As of February 26, 2007, we held 68 U.S. trademark
      registrations and 135 foreign trademark registrations. Additional trademarks
      are
      pending registration.


We
      believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our
      employees and their ability to continue to innovate. Garmin will continue to
      file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect
      Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

There
      is
      no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire,
      may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also
      possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive
      advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing
      and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
      rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or
      to
      obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation may be
      necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect
      its trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
      of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The
      telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment
      in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with Federal
      Communication Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver and
      cellular handset products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable
      authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in
      Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European
      Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new products or
      enhancements to Garmin’s products or losing certification for Garmin’s existing
      products could adversely affect our business. In addition, aviation products
      that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required
      to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation
      Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in
      an
      aircraft.

Because
      Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in
      Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect
      to
      remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations.
      The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provide
      that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
      to
      handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central
      Bank of China, also referred to as the CBC. Current regulations favor
      trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency
      earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used
      freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of
      merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign
      exchange banks. Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan
      companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside
      and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million
      respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
      within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to
      be
      reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits apply to remittances
      involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other
      foreign currencies. The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of
      the
      limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate
      business reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also
      imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt
      with the CBC.

Environmental
      Matters

The
      European Union (“EU”) has enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain
      Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("RoHS
      Directive") and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE
      Directive”). The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws
      prohibiting the use of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium
      and
      hexavalent chromium, in certain electronic products put on the market after
      July
      1, 2006. The WEEE Directive requires EU member states to enact laws that were
      to
      go into effect by August 13, 2005 regulating the collection, recovery and
      recycling of waste from certain electronic products. We have established a
      program in order to comply with such laws and regulations as they are enacted
      by
      the EU member states. We have modified the design of our products and our
      manufacturing processes in order to comply with such laws and regulations.


The
      People’s Republic of China has enacted legislation which is widely known as
“China RoHS”. The first phase of China RoHS will take effect on March 1, 2007
      and will require the disclosure and marking of certain substances, including
      lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic products.
      We have established a program in order to comply with the first phase of China
      RoHS.

The
      State
      of California has enacted legislation similar to the RoHS Directive and other
      states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the
      RoHS Directive and/or the WEEE Directive. The need for and cost of our
      compliance with such legislation cannot yet be determined but the cost could
      be
      substantial.

Several
      states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products
      and
      the labeling of mercury-containing products, including the member states of
      the
      Interstate Mercury Education and Reduction Clearinghouse (IMERC). Some of these
      laws, including those in Connecticut, New York, Vermont and Louisiana, are
      applicable to certain of Garmin’s GPS products. We have established an ongoing
      compliance program to ensure that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling
      requirements set forth in the relevant mercury legislation.

Portable
      Garmin products which use AC/DC adapters as an option for battery charging
      would
      require submissions of energy-use profiles if and when the future implementing
      measures resulting from the EU EuP (Energy Using Products) Directive define
      such
      products as being within their scope.

Employees

As
      of
      December 30, 2006, Garmin had 4,751 full-time employees worldwide, of whom
      1,728
      were in the United States, 53 were in Canada, 2,807 were in Taiwan, 160 were
      in
      Europe, and 3 were in other global locations. None of Garmin’s employees are
      represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
      Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

The
      risks described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional
      risks
      and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to
      be
      immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following
      risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be
      materially adversely affected.

Risks
      Related to the Company

Our
      Global Positioning System products depend upon satellites maintained by the
      United States Department of Defense. If a significant number of these satellites
      become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced or if the policies of the
      United States government for the use of the Global Positioning System without
      charge are changed or if there is interference with Global Positioning System
      signals, our business will suffer.

The
      Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system
      consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their
      ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United
      States Department of Defense. The Department of Defense does not currently
      charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their
      ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic
      and
      mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally
      designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile
      space environment in which they operate. However, of the current deployment
      of
      satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 13 years.


If
      a
      significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or
      are
      not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning
      System products and would have a material negative effect on our business.
      In
      addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain
      committed to the operation and maintenance of Global Positioning System
      satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government
      that
      provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge and without
      accuracy degradation will remain unchanged. Because of the increasing commercial
      applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies
      may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of Global
      Positioning System signals. However, in a presidential policy statement issued
      in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. is committed
      to supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will continue
      providing it free from direct user fees.

Some
      of
      our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide
      Area Augmentation System (WAAS). WAAS is operated by the Federal Aviation
      Administration (FAA). Any curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could
      result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby
      impacting our markets.

Any
      of
      the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products
      to
      select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on
      competing technologies.

A
      shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation
      would harm our business.

On
      September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and crashed four passenger aircraft
      operated by commercial air carriers, resulting in major loss of life and
      property. Following the terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft
      operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days. In addition to this
      shut
      down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by
      the
      additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly
      utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30
      enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas
      in the USA) airspace areas. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA)
      estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation
      aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.
      The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are
      conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to
      fly
      utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

The
      shut
      down of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of
      our
      general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products
      manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility
      in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and
      existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any
      future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general
      aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
      results.

Any
      reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the
      reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm
      our
      business.

Our
      Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard
      Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning
      System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency
      bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.
      The
      assignment of spectrum is controlled by an international organization known
      as
      the International Telecommunications Union (‘‘ITU’’). The Federal Communications
      Commission (‘‘FCC’’) is responsible for the assignment of spectrum for
      non-government use in the United States in accordance with ITU regulations.
      Any
      ITU or FCC reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band
      segmentation or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception
      of Global Positioning System signals and may materially and adversely affect
      the
      utility and reliability of our products, which would, in turn, have a material
      adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, emissions from mobile
      satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands
      or
      inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our
      products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating
      results. The FCC continually receives proposals for new technologies and
      services, such as ultra-wideband technologies, which may seek to operate in,
      or
      across, the radio frequency bands currently used by the GPS SPS. Adverse
      decisions by the FCC that result in harmful interference to the delivery of
      the
      GPS SPS may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of
      our
      products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and
      financial condition.


If
      we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely
      manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We
      expect
      that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived
      from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products is
      characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and
      changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify
      or
      improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry
      standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive
      or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research and
      development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing
      products and achieve market acceptance for such products. However, there can
      be
      no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed
      or,
      if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If
      we are
      unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and
      enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be
      adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial
      time and expense. We may need to license new technologies to respond to
      technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that
      we
      can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain
      on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies
      as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products
      are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve
      timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability
      of
      these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to
      our
      future success. From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain
      of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development
      delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory
      approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results
      of
      operations.

If
      we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able
      to
      secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or
      we
      could have costly excess production or inventories.

Historically,
      we have experienced steady increases in demand for our products although we
      did
      experience a decline in demand for our aviation products in 2001 due to
      declining economic conditions and the shut down of U.S. airspace as a result
      of
      the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. We have generally
      been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. However, the
      demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to
      forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as
      we
      introduce and support multiple products and as competition in the market for
      our
      products intensifies. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could
      cause the following problems in our operations:


·

If
                demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly
                increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional
                volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase
                production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.

·

Rapid
                increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could
                result
                in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other
                expenses. These higher costs could lower our profit margins. Further,
                if
                production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline,
                which may also lower our margins and reduce customer
                satisfaction.

·

If
                forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production
                resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components,
                which
                would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the
                excess
                inventories. Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess
                manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our
                facilities, which could result in lower margins.

We
      may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If
      our
      aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions
      or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.
      Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could
      cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.
      If
      any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for
      personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be
      subject to a judgment for punitive damages. We maintain insurance against
      accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no
      assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages
      to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially
      reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover
      awards of punitive damages. If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance
      to
      cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the
      award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial
      condition and results of operations.

We
      depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific
      components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers
      are
      not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if
      the
      costs of components rise.

We
      are
      dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current
      products. Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers
      include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays,
      memory chips and microprocessors. The cost, quality and availability of
      components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.
      Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain
      application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs
      are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not
      be
      currently available for these sole source components.

In
      the
      past (including in the first half of 2004) we have experienced shortages of
      liquid crystal displays and other components. In addition, if there are
      shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. If
      suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and
      if
      we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative
      source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to
      maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously
      harmed.

We
      license mapping data for use in our products from various sources. There are
      only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.
      If we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to
      obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is
      prohibitive, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would
      be
      seriously harmed.


We
      rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and
      disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because
      we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors,
      we
      are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels
      and
      support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain
      significant levels of our products in their inventories. If dealers and
      distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not
      maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be
      negatively impacted.

Many
      of
      our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.
      If
      our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those
      dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products.
      In
      the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of
      qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful
      relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution
      channels, our business will suffer.

Failure
      to manage our growth and expansion effectively could adversely impact our
      business.

Our
      ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan
      in a
      rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process.
      We continue to increase the scope of our operations domestically and
      internationally and have grown our shipments and headcount substantially. This
      growth has placed, and our anticipated growth in future operations will continue
      to place, a significant strain on our management systems and resources.

Our
      business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified
      personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our
      future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key
      executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative
      personnel. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key
      executive officers. We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key
      executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The
      loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key
      employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled
      personnel we require to maintain our market position may be difficult. For
      example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified
      electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design
      and develop new products and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to
      recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees,
      we
      may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

Gross
      margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Gross
      margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining due to price
      reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation
      devices (PNDs). We expect that gross margins on automotive/mobile products
      will
      continue to erode. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from
      period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition
      and unit volumes. In particular, the average selling prices of a specific
      product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we
      intend to rely primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding
      cost
      reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new
      products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher
      average selling prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be
      able
      to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such
      new products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new
      product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not
      achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of
      operations could be materially adversely affected.


Our
      quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our
      operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating
      results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline, the
      price of our stock would likely decline. As we expand our operations, our
      operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development
      costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales. If revenues decrease and
      we
      are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be
      negatively affected.

Historically,
      our revenues have usually been weaker in the first and third quarters of each
      fiscal year and have, from time to time, been lower than the preceding quarter.
      Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally
      lower in these quarters. Sales of certain of our marine and
      automotive

products
      tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer
      spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel
      season. Sales of our automotive/mobile products also tend to be higher in our
      fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic
      devices during the holiday season.

In
      addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with
      relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters,
      which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Our
      quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency
      translation.

Our
      Taiwan subsidiary holds, and is expected to continue to hold, significant cash,
      cash equivalents, and marketable securities and receivables denominated in
      U.S.
      Dollars. Because the U.S. Dollar is the primary currency for our business and
      in
      order to substantially reduce the economic consequence of any variation in
      the
      exchange rate for the U.S. Dollar and the New Taiwan Dollar on these assets,
      management expects that the Taiwan subsidiary will continue to hold the majority
      of these assets in U.S. Dollar or U.S. Dollar denominated instruments.
      Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period
      to translate into New Taiwan dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets
      held by our Taiwan subsidiary. This translation is required because the New
      Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary. This U.S.
      GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our
      financial statements as the New Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.
      Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. Because
      there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management
      will continue to focus on the Company’s operating performance before the impact
      of the foreign currency translation.

If
      we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our
      resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer
      customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The
      markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition
      to
      increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater
      financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors
      may
      be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes
      in
      customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to
      the
      development, promotion and sale of their products. Increased competition could
      result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss
      of
      market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future
      competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results
      of operations.

Our
      intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could
      suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by
      others.

We
      rely
      on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,
      confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
      our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents
      and
      registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect
      our
      rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that
      our
      patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark
      applications will become registered trademarks. Moreover, even if approved,
      our
      patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or
      otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons. Thus, any patents or
      trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a
      significant competitive advantage.


Third
      parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.
      Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
      condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of
      patents. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly
      and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could
      refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. We
      might
      not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses. Such infringement claims
      could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or
      permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the
      production or sale of major products.

Failure
      to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm
      our business.

We
      have
      certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to
      governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
      Federal Aviation Administration (‘‘FAA’’) certification is required for all of
      our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated
      aircraft. To the extent required, certification is an expensive and
      time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources. An
      inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could
      have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, therefore,
      our operating results.

In
      addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be
      decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our
      operating results.

Our
      business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with
      international sales and operations.

Our
      business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally.
      We
      estimate that approximately 38% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended
      December 30, 2006 represented products shipped to international destinations.
      Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
      be harmed by a variety of international factors, including:

·

changes
                in foreign currency exchange rates;

·

changes
                in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions,
                particularly in emerging markets;

·

trade
                protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;

·

potentially
                negative consequences from changes in tax laws;

·

difficulty
                in managing widespread sales and manufacturing operations; and

·

less
                effective protection of intellectual property.

We
      may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies
      that operate in Taiwan.

Relations
      between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC,
      and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan
      in
      the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
      and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.
      Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products,
      except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.


Taiwan
      has a unique international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty over
      all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.
      The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.
      Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established
      during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated
      that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain
      circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan. Relations
      between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value
      of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect our operations in Taiwan
      in
      the future.

There
      is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil
      liabilities in the Cayman Islands and Taiwan.

We
      are a
      Cayman Islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located
      outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be
      difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In
      addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the Cayman Islands
      or
      Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained
      against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities
      laws
      of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original
      actions brought in the Cayman Islands or Taiwan against us predicated upon
      the
      securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

Our
      shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we
      are
      incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our
      corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association,
      as
      amended, and by the Companies Law (2004 Revision) and the common law of the
      Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
      responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly
      established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
      jurisdictions in the United States. Therefore, you may have more difficulty
      in
      protecting your interests in the face of actions by the management, directors
      or
      our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation
      incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the comparatively
      less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this area.

Unlike
      many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not
      specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or
      consolidation of a company. This may make it more difficult for you to assess
      the value of any consideration you may receive in a merger or consolidation
      or
      to require that the offeror give you additional consideration if you believe
      the
      consideration offered is insufficient.

Shareholders
      of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as ourselves have no general rights
      under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain
      copies of lists of shareholders of the company. This may make it more difficult
      for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for
      a
      shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection
      with a proxy contest.

Subject
      to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may
      not
      bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands
      counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or
      derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.


We
      may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other
      ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully
      identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We
      intend
      to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments
      in
      complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into
      any strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets,
      additional product or services offerings or additional industry expertise.
      In
      December 2006, we acquired Dynastream Innovations, Inc. In January 2007, we
      acquired Digital Cyclone, Inc. and EME TecSat SAS. We may not be able to
      identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates,
      or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able
      to
      complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any
      future acquisition could result in difficulties assimilating acquired operations
      and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other
      business issues and opportunities. Integration of acquired companies may result
      in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management
      teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not
      to
      work for us. Our management has had limited experience in assimilating acquired
      organizations and products into our operations. We may not successfully
      integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
      and
      other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related
      to
      acquisitions we may make in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate
      such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

We
      have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on
      certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our
      effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. Federal statutory rate, because we
      have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology
      investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant
      effect on our financial results in the future.

Changes
      in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax
      law
      could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We
      do not
      believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently
      a
‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for United States federal income tax
      purposes. We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.
      However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made
      annually on the basis of facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control
      and because the principles for applying the passive foreign investment company
      tests are not entirely clear, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive
      foreign investment company. If we are a passive foreign investment company
      in
      any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could
      be
      liable to pay tax at ordinary income tax rates plus an interest charge upon
      some
      distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.
      Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any
      year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will
      continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect
      to
      such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue
      to
      satisfy the income or asset tests described above. Additional tax considerations
      would apply if we or any of our subsidiaries were a controlled foreign
      corporation.

Risks
      Relating to Our Shares

The
      volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common
      shares.


The
      market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly
      volatile. During 2006, the closing price of our common shares ranged from a
      low
      of $29.75 to a high of $56.89. A variety of factors could cause the price of
      our
      common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

announcements
                and rumors of developments related to our business or the industry
                in
                which we compete;

·

quarterly
                fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating
                results;

·

the
                availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such
                as
                flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our
                products;

·

general
                conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest
                rates;

·

announcements
                of technological innovations;

·

new
                products or product enhancements by us or our
                competitors;

·

product
                obsolescence and our ability to manage product
                transitions;

·

developments
                in patents or other intellectual property rights and
                litigation;

·

developments
                in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;
                and

·

any
                significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or
                significant markets where we sell our
                products.

In
      addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares
      of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
      fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of
      affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect
      the market price of our common shares, and the market price of our common shares
      may decline.

Our
      officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As
      of
      February 15, 2007 members and former members of our Board of Directors and
      our
      executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that
      may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially
      owned approximately 41% of our outstanding common shares

.
      Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of
      corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and
      acquisitions. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying,
      deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect
      the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.

Provisions
      in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter, delay
      or
      prevent a third party from acquiring us and Cayman Islands corporate law may
      impede a takeover, which could decrease the value of our shares.

Our
      Board
      of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 preferred shares and
      to
      determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
      voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the
      shareholders. This could have an adverse impact on the market price of our
      common shares. We have no present plans to issue any preferred shares, but
      we
      may do so. The rights of the holders of common shares may be subject to, and
      adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred shares that
      may be issued in the future. In addition, we have adopted a classified board
      of
      directors. Our shareholders are unable to remove any director or the entire
      board of directors without a super majority vote. In addition, a super majority
      vote is required to approve transactions with interested shareholders.
      Shareholders do not have the right to call a shareholders meeting. We have
      adopted a shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would
      significantly impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us
      without prior approval of our Board of Directors. This shareholders’ rights plan
      and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for
      a
      third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders.


Unlike
      many jurisdictions in the United States, Cayman Islands law does not currently
      provide for mergers as that expression is understood under corporate law in
      the
      United States. While Cayman Islands law does have statutory provisions that
      provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are commonly
      referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement,” the procedural
      and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more
      rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required
      to
      consummate a merger in the United States. Under Cayman Islands law and practice,
      a scheme of arrangement in relation to a solvent Cayman Islands exempted company
      must be approved at a shareholders’ meeting by a majority of the company’s
      shareholders who are present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at such
      meeting. The shares voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also
      represent at least 75% of the value of each class of the company’s shareholders
      (excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement) present
      and voting at the meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also
      sanction the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation.
      Although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the
      parties involved in the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks
      to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities
      to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise
      materially adversely affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand
      Court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

·

the
                statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with;

·

the
                shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question;

·

the
                scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve;
                and

·

the
                scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned
                under some other provision of the Companies Law.

      Inc., Denso Corporation, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., American Honda Motor
      Co., Inc., and Garmin International, Inc.

On
      May
      16, 2005, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. (“Encyclopaedia Britannica”) filed suit
      in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin
      Division, against Garmin’s wholly owned subsidiary Garmin International, Inc.
      (“Garmin International”) and five other unrelated companies, alleging
      infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,241,671 (“the ‘671 patent”). Garmin
      International believes that it should not be found liable for infringement
      of
      the ‘671 patent and additionally that the ‘671 patent is invalid. On December
      30, 2005, Garmin International filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for Claim
      Invalidity Based on Indefiniteness. On March 1, 2006 the court held a hearing
      on
      construction of the claims of the ‘671 patent. The parties await the court’s
      ruling on Garmin’s summary judgment motion and the court’s claim construction
      order. On May 23, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed an amended complaint
      claiming that Garmin International and the other defendants also infringe U.S.
      Patent No. 7,051,018 (“the ‘018 patent”), a continuation patent of the ‘671
      patent, which issued on May 23, 2006. Garmin International believes that it
      should not be found liable for infringement of the ‘018 patent and additionally
      that the ‘018 patent is invalid. On July 25, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica
      filed a new complaint claiming that Garmin International and the other
      defendants also infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,082,437 (“the ‘437 patent”), a
      continuation patent of the ‘671 patent, which issued on July 25, 2006. Garmin
      International believes that it should not be found liable for infringement
      of
      the ‘437 patent and additionally that the ‘437 patent is invalid. Although there
      can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not
      have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
      position, we believe that the claims are without merit and we will vigorously
      defend these actions

Garmin
      Ltd. v. TomTom, Inc.; Garmin Corporation v. TomTom, Inc.

(Wisconsin)

These
      lawsuits were filed by Garmin Ltd. and Garmin Corporation against TomTom, Inc.
      (“TomTom”) on January 31, 2006 and February 1, 2006, respectively, in the United
      States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. The lawsuits have
      been consolidated. Garmin Ltd. and Garmin Corporation filed an amended complaint
      on May 5, 2006. The amended complaint claims that certain TomTom products
      infringe U.S. Patents Nos. 6,188,956 and 6,222,485 owned by Garmin Corporation
      and U.S. Patents Nos. 6,901,330; 6,687,615 and 6,999,873 owned by Garmin Ltd.
      On
      April 27, 2006, TomTom served amended answers and counterclaims on Garmin Ltd.
      and Garmin Corporation which claim that certain products sold by these companies
      are infringing three U.S. patents that were purchased by an affiliate of TomTom
      International, B.V. from Horizon Navigation, Inc. on April 21, 2006. The three
      patents are U.S. Patents 5,291,412, 5,550,538 and 5,922,042. The amended answers
      and counterclaims also added Garmin International, Inc. as a counterclaim
      defendant. On December 22, 2006 the court ruled on summary judgment motions
      filed by the parties. The court ruled that Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries
      did
      not infringe any claim of any of the three patents asserted by TomTom in its
      counterclaims, that TomTom did not infringe certain claims of the patents
      asserted by Garmin and that certain claims of some of the patents asserted
      by
      Garmin were invalid. Ten claims asserted against TomTom by Garmin under a total
      of four patents remain unadjudicated and Garmin has filed a motion to reopen
      the
      case to address these claims. This motion is currently pending before the
      court.

Garmin
      Ltd. v. TomTom, Inc.

(Texas)

On
      August
      23, 2006, Garmin Ltd. filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for
      the Eastern District of Texas claiming that certain TomTom products infringe
      U.S. Patent No. 7,062,378 owned by Garmin Ltd. On October 20, 2006 TomTom filed
      an answer denying infringement and also filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit
      to the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin,
      which
      motion has been opposed by Garmin. On December 20, 2006 the court held a hearing
      on the motion to transfer and the motion is currently pending before the court.
      The case is currently in the early stages of discovery. Pending its ruling
      on
      the motion to transfer, the court has scheduled the trial for November
      2008.


Garmin
      (Europe) Ltd., Garmin International, Inc, Garmin Corporation and Garmin Ltd.
      v.
      TomTom International B.V.

Garmin
      Ltd

.

and the
      above-named subsidiaries of Garmin Ltd. filed a lawsuit against TomTom
      International B.V. in the District Court in the Hague, the Netherlands, on
      June
      27, 2006. The lawsuit seeks a declaration of non-infringement of TomTom’s
      European Community Registered Design No. 000267968-001 (the “Registered
      Design”). TomTom responded on July 14, 2006 by filing an action for preliminary
      relief in the District Court in the Hague, the Netherlands, claiming that
      certain models of Garmin’s StreetPilot products infringe the Registered Design.
      TomTom has also filed a counterclaim for infringement of the Registered Design
      in the main lawsuit. On November 2, 2006, the court issued a judgment in the
      preliminary relief proceedings finding that Garmin’s products do not infringe
      the Registered Design and denying TomTom’s claim for preliminary relief. TomTom
      has filed an appeal of this judgment. The court also awarded Garmin
      approximately 37,000 euros for attorneys’ fees and costs. Garmin believes that
      none of its products infringe the Registered Design and Garmin is prosecuting
      vigorously its action for a declaration of non-infringement. Although there
      can
      be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have
      a
      material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
      position, we believe that our products do not infringe the Registered Design
      and
      we intend to vigorously prosecute our lawsuit seeking a declaration of
      non-infringement.

Garmin
      (Europe) Ltd. v. TomTom International B.V

.

On
      July
      17, 2006, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. filed a lawsuit against TomTom International
      B.V.
      in the High Court of Justice in London, England. The lawsuit seeks a declaration
      that United Kingdom Patent No. GB 2400293 B (the “’293 patent”) owned by TomTom
      International B.V., is invalid and an order that the ‘293 patent be revoked. On
      July 31, 2006, TomTom International B.V. filed a defense indicating that it
      intended to defend this lawsuit and also filed a counterclaim alleging that
      certain models of Garmin’s StreetPilot products and Garmin’s nüvi products
      infringe the ‘293 patent. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. believes that none of its
      products infringe the ‘293 patent and that the ‘293 patent is invalid. On
      December 20, 2006, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. filed a second lawsuit against TomTom
      International B.V. in the High Court of Justice in London, England. This lawsuit
      seeks declarations that United Kingdom Patent Nos. GB 2400292 B (the “’292
      patent”) and GB 2400294 B (the “’294 patent”), owned by TomTom International
      B.V., are invalid and seeks orders that the ’292 and ’294 patents be revoked. On
      January 17, 2007, TomTom International B.V. filed a defense indicating that
      it
      intended to defend this lawsuit. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. intends to prosecute
      vigorously its actions seeking declarations of invalidity and revocation of
      the
’292, ‘293, and ’294 patents and to defend vigorously TomTom’s allegation of
      infringement of the ‘293 patent. Although there can be no assurance that an
      unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect
      on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe that
      TomTom’s counterclaim under the ‘293 patent is without merit and we intend to
      vigorously defend it.

From
      time
      to time the Company is involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary
      course of our business. We believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions
      will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
      and
      results of operations.

        Performance Graph

This
        performance graph shall not be deemed ‘‘filed’’ with the SEC or subject to
        Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, nor shall it be deemed
        incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act
        of
        1933, as amended.

The
        following graph illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return (rounded
        to
        the nearest whole dollar) of Garmin common shares during the period from
        December 31, 2001 through December 31, 2006, and compares it to the cumulative
        total return on the NASDAQ Composite Index and the NASDAQ 100 Index. Garmin
        is
        one of the constituent companies of the NASDAQ 100 Index. The comparison
        assumes
        a $100 investment on December 31, 2001, in Garmin common shares and in each
        of
        the foregoing indexes and assumes reinvestment of dividends.

        could
        materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements.
        The
        differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors
        including, but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers

        strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such

Overview

We
        are a
        leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information
        devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
        technology. We operate in four business segments, which serve the marine,
        outdoor/fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets. Our segments offer
        products through our network of independent dealers and distributors. However,
        the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary
        significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately. Our portable
        GPS
        receivers and accessories for marine, recreation/fitness and automotive/mobile
        segments are sold primarily to retail outlets. Our aviation products are
        portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument
        Flight
        Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft
        manufacturers.

Since
        our
        first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income
        from
        operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits. Our sales
        have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 40% since 2002 and our
        net
        income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 38% since 2002.
        The
        vast majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of
        new
        revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies
        in
        2003, MotionBased Technologies in 2005, and Dynastream Innovations Inc. in
        2006;
        these acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those
        years.

Since
        our
        principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience
        some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results. The functional
        currency of our European operations is the U.S. dollar (effective in 2001)
        and
        the functional currency of our Asian operations is the New Taiwan Dollar.
        Less
        than 15 percent of transactions of our European operations are now denominated
        in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro. We experienced $0.6 million, $15.3
        million, $(24.8) million, $(6.7) million, and $0.0 million in foreign currency
        gains (losses) during fiscal years 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
        respectively. To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions with
        the
        Euro, the British Pound Sterling or the New Taiwan Dollar, although we may
        utilize hedging transactions in the future.


Critical
        Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s
        discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations
        are
        based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared
        in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
        States. The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to
        make
        estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
        revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
        liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including
        those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns,
        bad
        debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty
        obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates
        on
        historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
        to be
        reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
        making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that
        are
        not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
        estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue
        Recognition

Garmin
        records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns
        and
        incentive offerings including rebates, price protection, promotions and other
        volume-based incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates
        and
        judgements using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.
        Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results.
        These incentives are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis and reviewed
        periodically. If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions
        to
        increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental
        reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.

Warranties

Garmin’s
        products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from
        one
        to two years. Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide
        warranty services. Garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
        obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future
        conditions. To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity
        or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual
        will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.

Inventory

Garmin
        writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory
        equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market
        value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If
        actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management,
        additional inventory write-downs may be required.


Investments

Investments
        are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized
        investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity. Investment
        income is recorded when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized
        when
        investments are sold. Investments are reviewed periodically to determine
        if they
        have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.
        If
        investments are determined to be impaired, a capital loss is recognized at
        the
        date of determination.

Testing
        for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgement.
        The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination
        of
        their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other
        than temporary are the key judgement elements. The discovery of new information
        and the passage of time can significantly change these judgements. Revisions
        of
        impairment judgements are made when new information becomes known, and any
        resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
        and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining
        fair
        value and assessing investment impairment.

Income
        Taxes

Garmin
        provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between
        the
        tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial
        reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will
        be in
        effect when the differences are expected to reverse. While no valuation
        allowance has been recorded, it is Garmin’s policy to record a valuation
        allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes
        is
        more likely than not to be realized. While Garmin has considered future taxable
        income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing
        the
        need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that
        it
        would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in
        the
        future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income
        in
        the period such determination was made. Likewise, should Garmin determine
        that
        it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess
        of
        its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase
        income in the period such determination was made.

In
        addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with
        uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize
        liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions
        based
        on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will
        be
        due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the
        reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized
        in the
        period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our
        estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment,
        a
        further charge to expense would result.

Stock
        Based Compensation

Garmin
        distributes stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) each year as
        part of Garmin’s compensation package for employees. Employees with certain
        levels of responsibility within Garmin are eligible for stock option or SAR
        grants, but the granting of options or SARs is at the discretion of the
        Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual
        obligation. Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 10 of
        the
        Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting
        Terms and Characteristics

Net
        Sales

Our
        net
        sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor
        network and to original equipment manufacturers. We recognize sales when
        title
        of the products passes to the customer, generally at the time products are
        shipped. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore backlog levels
        are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results. We aim to achieve
        a
        quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders
        within
        72 hours.

Net
          sales
          are subject to some seasonal fluctuation. Typically, sales of our consumer
          products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during
          the
          spring and summer marine season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased
          demand during the holiday buying season. Our aviation products do not experience
          much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release
          of
          new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.


Gross
        Profit

Raw
        material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.
        In the
        first half of 2006, we experienced meaningful price declines on flash memory
        and
        color screens, which allowed us to hold margins in our auto/mobile segment
        steady in the face of price declines, and allowed us to improve margins in
        other
        business segments as well. While these price declines did not continue
        throughout all of 2006, we did have additional component cost reductions
        as we
        neared year end. In 2005 we experienced a shift in product mix to lower-margin
        product groups, which continued in 2006, and price declines related to increased
        competition, both in relation to the rapidly growing automotive navigation
        product line. We experienced shortages in certain high technology components
        in
        early 2004 as well as upward pricing pressure on components in the first
        half of
        2004, much of which was alleviated by the end of the fiscal year.

Our
        existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
        in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from
        different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit
        us
        to use these lower cost components. We believe that because of our practice
        of
        performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house,
        our
        Shijr, Taiwan, Jhongli, Taiwan, Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing
        plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general,
        products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products. Our
        manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in
        Olathe
        and Salem.

Sales
        price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross
        profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile
        market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products
        sold at lower price points. The average selling prices of our aviation products
        have increased due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products
        sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales price variability inherent
        within
        the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our
        gross profit.

Selling,
        General and Administrative Expenses

Our
        selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries
                  for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries
                  and related costs for executives and administrative
                  personnel;

·

advertising,
                  marketing, and other brand building
                  costs;

·

accounting
                  and legal costs;

·

information
                  systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel
                  and related costs; and

·

occupancy
                  and other overhead costs.

With
        the
        expected increase of total revenues in the future, we expect selling, general
        and administrative expenses to continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
        We intend to increase advertising and marketing expenses in order to focus
        on
        individual markets and build increased brand awareness in the consumer
        marketplace, especially as we continue to develop new markets and expand
        opportunities in rapidly growing markets like portable automobile navigation,
        which is becoming a mass market. We also intend to increase our customer
        call
        center support as our business continues to grow. We also anticipate increased
        selling, general, and administrative costs associated with information
        technology staffing and support activities.


Research
        and Development

The
        majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our
        engineers, costs for high technology components used in product and prototype
        development, and costs of test equipment needed during product development.
        Approximately 82% of the research and development of our products is performed
        in the United States. The remainder of our research and development activities
        are performed by our Taiwan engineering group, which has increased in size
        in
        recent years.

We
        are
        committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of
        new
        products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer
        and
        aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices. We continue
        to
        grow our research and development budget in absolute terms.

Customers

No
        customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in the year ended December
        30,
        2006. Our top ten customers have contributed between 25% and 37% of net sales
        since 2001. We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts
        receivable of between 35 and 62 days since 2001. The average sales days in
        our
        customer accounts receivable was 62 days as of December 30, 2006. We have
        experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days
        due to
        changes in product mix and longer payment terms, and anticipate maintaining
        approximately the current level of accounts receivable days going
        forward.

Income
        Taxes

We
        have
        experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion
        of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory
        rates. In particular, lower marginal tax rates and substantial tax incentives
        offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital
        investments, and other Taiwan tax credits due to repatriation of 2006 earnings
        have continued to reduce our tax rate there. Therefore, profits earned in
        Taiwan
        have been taxed at a lower rate than those in the United States and Europe.
        As a
        result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 13.5 percent
        during 2006. We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our
        inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates
        at
        least through 2011. The current Taiwan tax incentives for which Garmin has
        received approval will end in 2011. We plan on applying for additional
        incentives for years beyond 2011 based on capital investments we expect to
        make
        in the future. However, there can be no assurance that such tax incentives
        will
        be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which
        we
        apply. Management also believes that the revenue shift to our lower-tax rate
        corporate entities will continue, however certain tax credits will not be
        available in 2007, so the effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is expected
        to be
        slightly higher than fiscal 2006. The actual effective tax rate will be
        dependent upon the production volume, additional capital investments made
        during
        fiscal 2007, and the composition of our earnings.

The
        increase in total net sales during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the
        introduction of over 70 new products and overall demand for our automotive
        and
        outdoor/fitness products. Total units sold increased 78% to 5,400,000 in
        from 3,028,000 in 2005. In general, management believes that continuous
        innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future
        revenue
        growth.

Garmin’s
        revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth quarter
        revenues being meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters.
        In
        2006 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern, with increases each
        quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases
        across all product lines. The revenue increase in the second quarter was
        primarily attributable to sell-in of popular new portable automobile navigation
        and outdoor/fitness products and Father’s Day/graduation purchases. The revenue
        increase in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to late summer
        new
        product releases and sales associated with the traditional holiday selling
        season. Revenues can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing
        of new
        product introductions.

The
        increase in net sales to consumers was primarily due to the introduction
        of many
        new automotive, outdoor/fitness, and marine products and overall demand for
        our
        automotive and outdoor/fitness products. It is management’s belief that the
        continued demand for the Company’s automotive products is due to overall
        increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of GPS,
        particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile navigation.
        Additionally, the expansion of the GPS market in general, as well as enhanced
        feature sets in our products specifically, have added to our growth. The
        increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2006 was primarily due to increased
        sales
        from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original equipment manufacturers)
        and retrofit markets. Sales of the G1000 integrated glass cockpit were the
        primary reason for increased OEM sales in 2006. While Temporary Flight
        Restrictions (TFR's) continue to impact general aviation, the flying community
        is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies in greater numbers.
        Should the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) impose more restrictions,
        or
        elect to shutdown U.S. airspace in the future, these factors could have a
        material adverse effect on our business.

The
        increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction
        of over 70 new products and strong demand for our automotive and outdoor/fitness
        products. The reduction in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the
        strong growth experienced in our lower-margin automotive/mobile product line,
        offset to some extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments.
        Notably gross margin in our automotive/mobile segment did not fall as much
        as
        anticipated due to better than anticipated raw material cost reductions,
        volume
        discounts on certain components, less price competition than anticipated,
        and
        new “premium” feature-rich products with higher selling prices and margins.
        Management believes that the trend to lower gross margin percentages will
        continue in the future as net sales of automotive products increase at a
        faster
        rate than the other business segments. The decline in aviation gross margin
        was
        primarily due to a shift in product mix within our OEM and retrofit products
        and
        the delay of some anticipated OEM and retrofit products.


Selling,
        General and Administrative Expenses

The
        increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment
        generally across the organization, significantly increased advertising costs
        (up
        93%) associated primarily with mass-market advertising to increase brand
        awareness and promote our automotive products, increased information technology
        staffing and support costs, increased staffing in our sales and marketing
        group
        to increase focus on specific target markets, and additional staffing in
        our
        customer call center. Management expects that because of strong demand for
        our
        products, selling, general and administrative expenses will rise in absolute
        dollars but decline as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2007 as increased
        advertising and marketing activities build awareness of the Garmin brand
        and
        demand for Garmin products worldwide.

Research
        and Development Expenses

The
        increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to
        the
        addition of over 250 associates to our research and development team during
        fiscal 2006. Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives
        for
        future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development,
        and
        introduction of new products. Management expects that its research and
        development expenses will increase approximately 25% - 30% during fiscal
        2007 on
        an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated introduction of a strong
        portfolio of new products slated for fiscal 2007. Management expects to continue
        to invest in the research and development of new products and technology
        in
        order to maintain Garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it
        competes.

        income (expense) principally consists of interest income, interest expense

        foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Other income (expense) was higher
        in
        fiscal 2006 relative to fiscal 2005, with the majority of this difference
        caused
        by increased interest income in 2006. Interest income for fiscal 2006 increased
        due to higher interest rates and larger cash and marketable securities balances
        during the year, increasing the returns on the Company’s cash and cash
        equivalents.

During
        fiscal 2006, the Company experienced foreign currency exchange gains of $0.6
        million, although the U.S. Dollar weakened slightly versus the Taiwan Dollar
        and
        British Pound ($32.60 TD/USD and $0.51 GBP/USD) relative to the end of fiscal
        2005 ($32.84 TD/USD and $0.58 GBP/USD). During fiscal 2005, the Company
        experienced foreign currency exchange gains of $15.3 million, as the U.S.
        Dollar
        strengthened versus the Taiwan Dollar and British Pound ($32.84 TD/USD and
        $0.58
        GBP/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2004 (32.19 TD/USD and $0.52
        GBP/USD).

Income
        Tax Provision

Income
        tax expense increased by $19.0 million, to $80.4, for fiscal year 2006 from
        $61.4 million for fiscal year 2005, due to our higher taxable income. The
        effective tax rate was 13.5% for fiscal 2006 versus 16.5% for fiscal 2005.
        The
        decrease in tax rate is due to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan
        as a
        result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
        in
        Taiwan, tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of
        our
        Taiwan earnings to our parent company, and the increased contribution to
        our
        income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2006 relative to 2005. This lower
        effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a
        percentage of revenue of approximately 1.4% from fiscal 2005 to fiscal
        2006.

Net
        Income

As
        a
        result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 65% to $514.1
        million for fiscal year 2006 compared to $311.2 million for fiscal year
        2005.

The
        increase in total net sales during fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the
        introduction of over 50 new products and overall demand for our automotive
        and
        aviation products. Total units sold increased 31% to 3,028,000 in 2005 from
        2,306,000 in 2004. In general, management believes that continuous innovation
        and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue
        growth.


The
        Company’s revenues are normally seasonal, with the fiscal second and fourth
        quarter revenues meaningfully higher than the first and third fiscal quarters.
        In 2005 revenues followed this typical seasonal pattern, with increases each
        quarter over the prior year’s quarter due to the impact of new product releases
        across all product lines.

The
        revenue increase in second quarter was primarily attributable to initial
        sell-in
        of popular new portable automobile navigation products, the onset of the
        marine
        selling season, and Father’s Day purchases. The revenue increase in the fourth
        quarter was primarily attributable to sales momentum in our automotive products
        segment, new product releases, and sales associated with the traditional
        holiday
        selling season. The increase in aviation sales for fiscal 2005 was primarily
        due
        to increased sales from panel mount products sold into the OEM (original
        equipment manufacturers) and retrofit markets. Sales of the G1000 integrated
        glass cockpit was the primary reason for increased OEM sales in 2005. While
        Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR's) continue to impact general aviation,
        the
        flying community is adapting to these changes and returning to the skies
        in
        greater numbers. Should the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) impose
        more
        restrictions, or elect to shutdown U.S. airspace in the future, these factors
        could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Revenues
        can also be impacted in any given quarter by the timing of new product
        introductions. It is management’s belief that the continued demand for Garmin’s
        products is due to the expansion of the GPS market in general, and overall
        increased consumer awareness of the capabilities and applications of GPS,
        particularly as those capabilities pertain to automobile
        navigation.

The
        increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the introduction
        of over 50 new products and overall demand for our marine, outdoor/fitness,
        automotive/mobile, and aviation products. The reduction in gross margin
        percentage was primarily due to reduced prices on older marine and
        outdoor/fitness products in advance of new product releases, and a shift
        in
        product mix towards the faster-growing, lower-margin automotive/mobile product
        line. The increase in aviation gross margin was primarily due to a shift
        in
        product mix within our OEM and retrofit products, as the G1000 product line
        began a second year of selling into new aircraft and program costs were no
        longer a significant cost in this business segment.


Selling,
        General and Administrative Expenses

The
        increase in expense was primarily attributable to increases in employment
        generally across the organization (net increase of over 400 non-engineering
        employees), significantly increased advertising costs (up 101%) associated
        primarily with increasing Garmin brand awareness and promotion of automotive
        products, increased information technology staffing and support costs, increased
        staffing in our sales and marketing group to increase focus on specific target
        markets, and additional staffing in our customer call center.

Research
        and Development Expenses

The
        increase in research and development expense was primarily attributable to
        the
        addition of 142 associates to our research and development team during fiscal
        2005. Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future
        growth and success of the Company is continuous innovation, development,
        and
        introduction of new products, and this requires strong support of our research
        and development activities.

        experienced foreign currency exchange losses of $24.8 million, as the U.S.
        Dollar weakened versus the Taiwan Dollar and British Pound (32.19 TD/USD
        and
        $0.52 GBP/USD) relative to the end of fiscal 2003 (34.05 TD/USD and $0.56
        GBP/USD).


Income
        Tax Provision

Income
        tax expense increased by $11.9 million, to $61.4 million, for fiscal year
        from $49.5 million for fiscal year 2004 due to our higher taxable income.
        The
        effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal 2005 versus 19.4% for fiscal 2004.
        The
        decrease in tax rate was due to additional tax benefits received from Taiwan
        as
        a result of our continued capital investment in our manufacturing facilities
        in
        Taiwan, tax credits resulting from our decision to repatriate certain of
        our
        Taiwan earnings to our parent company, and the increased contribution to
        our
        income from lower tax jurisdictions during 2005 relative to 2004. This lower
        effective tax rate resulted in a decrease in the ratio of income tax as a
        percentage of revenue of approximately 0.5% from fiscal 2004 to fiscal
        2005.

Net
        Income

As
        a
        result of the various factors noted above, net income increased 51% to $311.2
        million for fiscal year 2005 compared to $205.7 million for fiscal year

Liquidity
        and Capital Resources

Net
        cash
        generated by operations was $361.9 million, $247.0 million, and $208.9 million
        for fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. We operate with a
        customer-oriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to meet
        customer demand. Because we desire to respond quickly to our customers and
        minimize order fulfillment time, our inventory levels are generally substantial
        enough to meet most demand. We also attempt to carry sufficient inventory
        levels
        of key components so that potential supplier shortages have as minimal an
        impact
        as possible on our ability to deliver our finished products. We significantly
        increased our raw material and finished goods inventories in the third quarter
        of 2006 in anticipation of a strong demand for our products during the holiday
        season, and returned them to more normal levels by the end of the fourth
        quarter. We prefer to have sufficient finished goods on hand to meet anticipated
        demand for our products. Raw materials and finished goods inventory levels
        continued to grow year over year as a function of our growing sales. We
        anticipate days of inventory to stabilize at current levels in 2007 although
        absolute dollars of inventory will continue to rise, reflecting the growth
        of
        our business.

Capital
        expenditures in 2006 totaled $92.9 million, an increase of $65.8 million
        from
        fiscal 2005. This amount in 2006 reflects the purchase and renovation of
        an
        additional manufacturing facility in Jhongli, Taiwan, the purchase of a new
        European headquarters, as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal
        2006.
        Capital expenditures in 2005 totaled $27.1 million, a decrease of $51.0 million
        from fiscal 2004. Capital expenditures during 2004 included the Olathe, Kansas
        facility expansion. The amount in 2005 reflects normal capital expenditure
        levels.

We
        have
        budgeted approximately $65 million of capital expenditures during fiscal
        2007 to
        include normal ongoing capital expenditures as well as purchases of production
        machinery and equipment to expand capacity in the Jhongli, Taiwan facility.

In
        addition to capital expenditures, in 2006 cash flow used in investing related
        to
        the purchase of Dynastream Innovations, Inc. for $36.5 million, fixed income
        securities associated with the investment of our on-hand cash balances and
        approximately $3.1 million of intangible assets. Garmin’s average return on its
        investments during fiscal 2006 was approximately 4.7%. In addition to capital
        expenditures, in 2005 cash flow used in investing related to the purchase
        of
        fixed income securities associated with the investment of our on-hand cash
        balances and approximately $3.6 million of intangible assets. Garmin’s average
        return on its investments during fiscal 2005 was approximately 3.1%. In addition
        to capital expenditures, in 2004 cash flow used in investing related to the
        purchase of fixed income securities associated with the investment of our
        on-hand cash balances and approximately $1.8 million of intangible assets.
        Garmin’s average return on its investments during fiscal year 2004 was
        approximately 1.7%. It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash
        consistent with Garmin’s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board
        of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital,
        maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the
        constraint of low credit risk.


Cash
        flow
        related to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2006 of
        $132.7
        million. During 2006, Garmin repurchased 1,155,300 shares of its common shares
        under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved by the
        Board of Directors on August 3, 2006 and expires on December 31, 2007. Sources
        and uses in financing activities during 2006 related primarily to uses for
        the
        payment of a dividend ($107.9 million) and stock repurchase ($50.5 million),
        and
        a source of cash from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise
        of
        employee stock options, the related tax benefit, and the employee stock purchase
        plan ($25.7 million). Cash flow related to financing activities resulted
        in a
        net use of cash in 2005 of $70.9 million. During 2005, Garmin repurchased
        638,000 shares of its common shares under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase
        program that was approved by the Board of Directors on April 21, 2004 and
        expired on April 30, 2006. Sources and uses in financing activities during
        related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend ($54.0 million) and
        stock repurchase ($26.7 million), and a source of cash from the issuance
        of
        common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options, the related
        tax
        benefit, and the employee stock purchase plan ($9.7 million). Cash flow related
        to financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2004 of $51.1 million.
        During 2004, Garmin repurchased 100,000 shares of its common shares under
        the
        3,000,000-share stock repurchase program. Sources and uses in financing
        activities during 2004 related primarily to uses for the payment of a dividend
        ($54.1 million) and stock repurchase ($3.1 million), and a source of cash
        from
        the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options,
        the related tax benefit, and the employee stock purchase plan ($6.1
        million).

Cash
        dividends paid to shareholders were $107.9 million, $54.0 million, and $54.1
        million during fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

We
        believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will
        be
        sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and
        other
        cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2009.

We

        have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item
        7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
        Sensitivity

We
        have
        market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and
        services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials
        costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.
        Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset
        pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product
        mix
        and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We
        do not
        believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial
        condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to
        significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such
        higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could
        adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
        operations.

Foreign
        Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The
        operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure
        to movements in currency exchange rates. We generally have not been
        significantly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations because the Taiwan
        Dollar and British Pound have proven to be relatively stable. However,
        periodically we have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses
        due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential
        of
        volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a
        significant effect on our results of operations.

The
        currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are
        the Taiwan Dollar and British Pound. Garmin Corporation, located in Shijr,
        Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company
        translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income
        and
        expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the
        effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected
        to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable
        securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

The
        TD/USD exchange rate decreased 0.7% during 2006, which resulted in a cumulative
        translation adjustment of negative $1.2 million at the end of fiscal 2006
        and a
        net foreign currency loss of $3.1 million at Garmin Corporation during 2006.


Garmin
        Europe, located in Romsey, Great Britain, uses the U.S. Dollar as the functional
        currency. However, as some transactions occur in British Pounds, foreign
        currency gains or losses have been realized historically and have become
        more
        significant in recent years as Garmin Europe has grown. The GBP/USD exchange
        rate decreased 12.3% during 2006 and resulted in a net foreign currency gain
        of
        $3.7 million at Garmin Europe.

If
        the
        TD/USD exchange rate had decreased 10%

and the
        GBP/USD exchange rate had increased 10% in 2006, the cumulative translation
        adjustment would have been a negative $1.4 million at the end of fiscal
        2006 and the foreign currency loss would have been $44.7 million. As the
        majority of our worldwide sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, the impact
        on
        sales related to foreign currency movements is minimal.

Interest
        Rate Risk

We
        have
        $0.2 million of outstanding long-term debt which is associated with the
        acquisition of Dynastream Innovations, Inc. which will be eliminated in fiscal
        2007. Given this debt amount is financially immaterial to Garmin, there is
        no
        meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We
        are
        exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable
        securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated
        with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. A hypothetical change of
        10%
        in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains
        or
        losses. At December 30, 2006, cumulative unrealized losses on those securities
        were $4.7 million.

Report
          of Ernst & Young LLP

Independent
          Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
          Board
          of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
          Ltd.

We
          have
          audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and
          Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005,
          and
          the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and
          cash
          flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 30, 2006.
          Our
          audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index
          at
          Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility
          of
          the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
          these
          financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
          conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
          Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
          we plan
          and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
          financial
          statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
          on a
          test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
          statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
          used and
          significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
          financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
          reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
          our
          opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
          all
          material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and
          Subsidiaries at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 and the consolidated
          results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
          years in
          the period ended

December
          30, 2006, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
          Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered
          in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
          fairly
          in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We
          also
          have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
          Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Garmin Ltd. and
          Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December
          30, 2006,
          based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework
          issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
          and our report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
          thereon.

(In

December
        30, 2006 and December 31, 2005

1.
        History of the Business

Garmin
        Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) manufacture, market, and
        distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related
        products. Garmin Corporation (GC), wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd., is primarily
        responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to
        Garmin International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC, and Garmin
        (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., and, to
        a
        lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s
        products in Asia and the Far East. GII is primarily responsible for sales
        and
        marketing of the Company’s products in many international markets and in the
        United States as well as research and new product development. GII also
        manufactures certain products for the Company’s aviation segment. GEL is
        primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products,
        principally within the European market.

2.
        Stock Split

On
        July  21, 2006 a two-for-one stock split was approved
        by  Garmin's shareholders and was effected at the close of the
        market on August 15, 2006. All prior period common stock and applicable share
        and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 2006
        stock
        split.

3.
        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
        of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
        with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
        accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin
        Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances
        and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal
        Year

The
        Company has adopted a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the
        calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar
        year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including
        the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week
        fiscal
        year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain
        fiscal
        years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year
        occurs.

In
        those
        resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra
        week
        of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial
        results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter,
        will
        not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years
        and
        the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Fiscal 2006 and 2004 included
        weeks while fiscal 2005 included 53 weeks.

Foreign
        Currency Translation

GC
        utilizes the New Taiwan Dollar as its functional currency. In accordance
        with
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52,

Foreign
        Currency Translation

,
        the
        financial statements of GC for all periods presented have been translated
        into
        United States dollars, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd. and GII, and
        the
        reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing
        during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for
        all
        assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate
        component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of
        ($1,168) as of December 30, 2006 and ($8,693) as of December 31, 2005,
        respectively, net of related taxes, have been included in accumulated other
        comprehensive gain/(loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance
        sheets.


Transactions
        in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at
        the
        transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions
        are
        translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All
        differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange
        gains
        of $596 and $15,265, and an exchange loss of $24,819, for the years ended
        December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, respectively.
        The
        gain in fiscal 2006 was the result of nearly off-setting currency moves in
        the
        Taiwan Dollar and the Euro and British Pound Sterling. The gain in fiscal
        was the result of strengthening of the United States dollar throughout those
        years. The loss in fiscal 2004 was due to weakening of the United States
        dollar
        compared to the Taiwan Dollar throughout the year. These gains and losses
        are
        included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
        income.

Earnings
        Per Share

Basic
        earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number
        of
        common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the
        number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock
        options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased
        from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s
        stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 11.

Cash
        and Cash Equivalents

For
        purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
        on
        hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
        of
        three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash
        equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those
        instruments.

Inventories

Inventories
        are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
        weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
        method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and GEL. Inventories consisted
        of
        the following:

Long-Lived
        Assets

In
        accordance with SFAS No. 144,

Accounting
        for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

,
        the
        Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
        in
        circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
        recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable
        if it
        exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the
        use
        and eventual disposition of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying
        amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
        loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived
        asset exceeds its fair value.

Dividends

On
        April
        26, 2006 the Board of Directors declared a post-split dividend of $0.50 per
        share to be paid on December 15, 2006 to shareholders of record on December
        1,
        2006. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $107,923. The dividend
        has been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On
        July
        20, 2005 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share (post
        split) to be paid on December 15, 2005 to shareholders of record on December
        1,
        2005. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $53,974. The dividend
        has
        been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On
        July
        23, 2004 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share (post
        split) to be paid on December 15, 2004 to shareholders of record on December
        1,
        2004. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $54,095. The dividend
        has
        been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately
        $129,651 and $106,979 of GARMIN’s retained earnings are indefinitely restricted
        from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the law of Taiwan at December
        30,
        2006, and December 31, 2005, respectively.

Intangible
        Assets

At
        December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the Company had patents, license
        agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived
        intangible assets recorded at a cost of $76,148 and $93,472, respectively.
        The
        Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill)
        was $24,457 at December 30, 2006 and $13,701 at December 31, 2005.

Identifiable,
        finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
        lives
        on a straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization
        was
        $33,025 and $61,290 at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005 respectively.
        Amortization expense was $21,147, $22,648, and $20,832, for the years ended
        December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, respectively.
        In
        the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $5,695,
        $4,498,
        $3,967, $3,865, and $3,681, respectively.

Marketable
        Securities

Management
        determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the
        time
        of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet
        date.

All
        of
        the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at
        December 30, 2006. See Note 4. Available-for-sale securities are stated at
        fair
        value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other
        comprehensive gain. At December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, cumulative
        unrealized losses of $3,968 and $3,681, respectively, were reported accumulated
        in other comprehensive gain/(loss), net of related taxes.


The
        amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted
        for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in
        the
        case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
        Such amortization is included in interest income from investments. Realized
        gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary
        are
        included in net securities gains (losses). The cost of securities sold is
        based
        on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on
        available-for-sale securities have not been material in any period.

Income
        Taxes

The
        Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance
        with
        SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
        for Income Taxes

.
        The
        liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
        based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
        their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the
        enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are
        expected to reverse. Income taxes have not been accrued by Garmin Corporation
        (GC) for the unremitted earnings of GI totaling approximately $272,732 and
        $210,216 at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, because
        such
        earnings are intended to be reinvested in this subsidiary indefinitely. 
Similarly, income taxes have not been accrued by Garmin B.V. for the unremitted
        earnings of GC totaling approximately $656,530 and $753,474 at December 30,
        and December 31, 2005 nor have they been accrued by Garmin Ltd for the
        unremitted earnings of Garmin Europe totaling approximately $50,526 and $35,987
        at December 30, 2006 and December 31,2005 for the same reason.

The
        Company’s income tax liability balance includes tax contingencies that are
        recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken
        that could be challenged by taxing authorities.  These exposures result
        from the varying applications of statutes, rules, regulations, and
        interpretations.  The Company’s tax contingencies are established based on
        judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions and relate to transfer
        pricing positions we have taken in a variety of the countries in which we
        operate, certain tax credits, and various foreign and state tax matters. 
The ultimate resolution of these matters may be materially greater or less
        than
        the amount we have accrued and could have a material effect on our effective
        tax
        rate in the period when such matter is resolved.

Use
        of Estimates

The
        preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
        principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
        make
        estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
        financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
        from
        those estimates.

Concentration
        of Credit Risk

The
        Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s
        pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require
        security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided
        for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and consistently have
        been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended
        terms consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms
        can
        be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing
        of new product releases by the Company.

Revenue
        Recognition

The
        Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the product is shipped
        to the
        customer and title has transferred. The Company assumes no remaining significant
        obligations associated with the product sale other than that related to its
        warranty programs discussed below.


Shipping
        and Handling Costs

Shipping
        and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying
        consolidated financial statements.

Product
        Warranty

The
        Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty
        period is generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception
        of
        certain aviation products and marine products for which the warranty period
        is
        two years from the date of installation.

Sales
        Programs

The
        Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers
        based
        on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth. Additionally,
        from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain
        products. Estimated rebates and incentives payable to distributors are regularly
        reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis. In addition,
        the
        Company provides retailers with product discounts termed “price protection” to
        assist these retailers in clearing older products from their inventories
        in
        advance of new product releases. These rebates, incentives, and price
        protections are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying
        consolidated statements of income.

Advertising
        Costs

The
        Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted
        to
        approximately $114,749, $59,309, and $29,577 for the years ended December
        30,
        2006, December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, respectively.

Research
        and Development

A
        majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United
        States. Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted
        to approximately $113,314, $74,879, and $61,580 for the years ended December
        30,
        2006, December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, respectively.

Customer
        Service and Technical Support

Customer
        service and technical support costs are included on the sales and marketing
        expense line on our statements of operations. Customer service and technical
        support costs include costs associated with performing order processing,
        answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and
        other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to
        customers. In connection with the sale of certain products, we provide a
        limited
        amount of free technical support assistance to customers. The technical support
        is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. We
        accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment.

Software
        Development Costs

Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 86,

“Accounting
        for Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or otherwise
        Marketed,”

requires
        companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until
        technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs
        are
        capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.
        Our
        capitalized software development costs are not significant. SFAS 2,

“Accounting
        for Research and Development Costs,”

establishes accounting and reporting standards for research and development.
        In
        accordance with SFAS 2, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or
        after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in
        the
        period they are incurred and included in research and development costs on
        our
        statement of operations.


Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

The
        Company currently sponsors three stock based employee compensation plans.
        On
        January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
        Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

Share-Based
        Payment

,
        which
        is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

.
        SFAS
        No. 123(R) requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
        expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
        including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated
        fair
        values. SFAS No. 123(R) supersedes the Company’s previous accounting under
        Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
        for Stock Issued to Employees

,
        for
        periods beginning in fiscal 2006.

The
        Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective method.
        Under the modified prospective method, compensation costs are recognized
        beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS
        No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date
        and based on the requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all awards granted to
        employees prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123(R) that remain
        unvested on the effective date. The Company’s consolidated financial statements
        as of and for fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 reflect the impact of SFAS
        No. 123(R). In accordance with the modified prospective transition method,
        the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the prior periods have not
        been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of SFAS
        No. 123(R).

SFAS
        No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based
        payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value
        of
        the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized
        as
        stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service period in the
        Company’s consolidated financial statements. Prior to the adoption of SFAS
        No. 123(R), the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and
        directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB Opinion
        No. 25 as allowed under SFAS No. 123. Under the intrinsic value
        method, no stock-based compensation expenses have been recognized in the
        Company’s consolidated statements of income for stock options because the
        exercise price of the Company’s stock options granted to employees and directors
        equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.

As
        stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated
        statement of income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 is based
        on
        awards ultimately expected to vest, it has been reduced for estimated
        forfeitures. SFAS No. 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
        time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual
        forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based
        on
        historical experience and management’s estimates. In the Company’s pro forma
        information required under SFAS No. 123 for the periods prior to fiscal
        2006, the Company accounted for stock option forfeitures as they occurred.
        The
        cumulative adjustment to reduce costs that were actually recognized to reflect
        estimated forfeitures is not material.

The
        following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share
        if
        the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
        123,

Recently
        Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In
        June
        2006, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation
        No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB
        Statement No. 109” (FIN 48), which prescribes a recognition threshold and
        measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
        of
        a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN 48 also
        provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
        accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 will be
        effective for our fiscal year beginning December 31, 2006. We are currently
        evaluating the impact of the adoption of FIN 48, however we do not expect
        the
        adoption to have a material impact on our financial reporting and
        disclosure.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No. 157,

Fair
        Value Measurements

(“SFAS
        No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair
        value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
        No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or
        permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 will be effective for our
        fiscal year beginning December 31, 2006. We do not expect the adoption of
        SFAS
        No. 158 to have a material impact on our financial reporting and
        disclosure.

SFAS
        No. 153, “

Exchanges
        of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for
        Nonmonetary Transactions

”
        eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive
        assets and replaces it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary
        assets that do not have commercial substance. Further, the amendments made
        by
        SFAS No. 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary
        assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged.
        Previously, Opinion No. 29 required that the accounting for an exchange of
        a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest
        in
        the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount
        of
        the asset relinquished. The statement is effective for nonmonetary asset
        exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005.
        Earlier application is permitted for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal
        periods beginning after the date of issuance. The provisions of this statement
        shall be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS No. 153 did
        not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
        statements.

SFAS
        No. 154, “

Accounting
        Changes and Error Corrections

”
is
        a
        replacement of APB Opinion No. 20,

Accounting
        Changes

,
        and
        FASB Statement No. 3,

Reporting
        Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements

.
        Statement 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and
        changes the accounting for and a reporting of a change in accounting principle.
        Statement 154 requires retrospective application to the prior periods’ financial
        statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is
        impracticable. Statement 154 is effective for the accounting changes and
        corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
        2005. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material effect on
        the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

        at December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, and are reported
        as
        restricted cash.

In
        the
        normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to
        various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
        patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other
        risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company
        and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal
        matters, or if not, what the impact might be. However, the Company’s

management
        does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have
        a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial
        position or cash flows.

        Employee Benefit Plans

GII
        sponsors an employee retirement plan under which its employees may contribute
        up
        to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum
        limitations and to which GII contributes a specified percentage of each
        participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the Plan.
        Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees
        may
        contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation. Both GII and GEL contribute
        an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
        During the years ended December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December
        25,
        2004, expense related to these plans of $8,690, $6,378, and $5,183, was charged
        to operations.

Certain
        of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit
        pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final
        pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years
        ended
        December 30, 2006, December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, were significant.

        benefits included in the table above reflect $0.24, $0.22, and $0.13 per
        weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 30,
        2006,
        December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004, respectively. The Company currently
        expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2011, at which
        time
        these tax benefits expire.

Deferred
        income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between
        the
        carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
        and
        the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the

        Segment Information

In
        the
        first quarter of 2006, the Company changed its internal reporting. Upon this
        change, it determined that it has four reportable segments. Prior periods
        have
        been restated to conform to the current period’s presentation.

The
        Company operates within its targeted markets through four reportable segments,
        those being related to products sold into the marine, automotive/mobile,
        outdoor/fitness, and aviation markets. All of the Company’s reportable segments
        offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and
        distributors as well as through OEM’s. However, the nature of products and types
        of customers for the four segments vary significantly. As such, the segments
        are
        managed separately. The Company’s marine, automotive/mobile, and outdoor/fitness
        segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and
        accessories sold primarily to retail outlets. These products are produced
        primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s aviation products
        are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument
        Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain
        aircraft manufacturers.

The
        Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating
        Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources
        based on income before income taxes of each segment.

Income
        before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including
        certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense,
        foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses.
        The
        accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described
        in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment
        sales or transfers.


The
        identifiable assets associated with each reportable segment reviewed by the
        CODM
        include accounts receivable and inventories. The Company does not report
        property and equipment, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization,
        or
        capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

Revenues,
        interest income and interest expense, income before income taxes, and
        identifiable assets for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented
        below:

        Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting
        for Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based
        compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement
        of
        income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, was $12 million. As a
        result
        of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company’s income before income taxes and
        net income for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006 are $6,194 and $5,358
        million lower, respectively, than if it had continued to account for share-based
        compensation under APB Opinion No. 25. The adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) decreased
        the Company’s calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share by $0.02
        during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006.

The
        various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below:

        Equity Incentive Plan

In
        June,
        2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the Plan) providing
        for
        grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and “other” stock
        compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant
        to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The
        stock
        options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years
        or
        as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee
        and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.
        During
        2006 and 2005, the Company granted 2,341,800 and 896,000 stock appreciation
        rights, respectively.

        Equity Incentive Plan

In
        October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the Plan)
        providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options and “other”
stock compensation awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries,
        pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares of common stock were available
        for issuance. The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly
        over a
        period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors
        or the
        Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant,
        if
        not exercised. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, the Company granted 64,131, 755,750,
        and 1,394,000 nonqualified stock options, respectively. There have been no
        “other” stock compensation awards granted under the Plan.


        Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

Also
        in
        October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
        directors (the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up to
        100,000
        common shares. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly
        over
        a three-year period. During 2006, 2005, and 2004, options to purchase 7,630,
        11,000, and 13,242 shares were granted under this plan.

Stock-Based
        Compensation Activity

A
        summary
        of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under
        the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2000
        Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan for the years ended December 30, 2006,
        December 31, 2005, and December 25, 2004 is provided below:

The
        weighted-average remaining contract life for options outstanding and exercisable
        at December 30, 2006 are 7.90 and 6.14 years respectively.

Pro

        information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by SFAS

        123.

SFAS
        No.
        123 requires the pro forma information be determined as if the Company has
        accounted for its employee stock options under the fair value method of that
        statement. As described below, the fair value accounting provided under SFAS
        No.
        123 requires the use of option valuation models that were not developed for
        use
        in valuing employee stock options.


The
        fair
        value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
        option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for
        2006,
        2005 and 2004:

The
        Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
        the
        fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
        transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
        subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
        the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly
        different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
        input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
        opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
        measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

The
        total
        fair value of shares vested during 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $9,413, $8,249,
        and
        $6,418 respectively.

The
        aggregate intrinsic values of options outstanding and exercisable at December
        30, 2006 were $204.1 million and $100.2 million, respectively. The aggregate
        intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 30, 2006
        was
        $42.8 million. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference
        between the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal
        period, which was $55.66 on December 29, 2006, and the exercise price multiplied
        by the number of options outstanding.

As
        of
        December 30, 2006, there was $64.2 million of total unrecognized compensation
        cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees
        under the option plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a period
        of
        five years.

Employee
        Stock Purchase Plan

The
        shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up to
        2,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares
        will be
        offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market
        value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value
        on
        the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock
        purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2006,
        2005, and 2004, 124,693, 112,798, and 117,900 shares were purchased under
        the
        plan for a total purchase price of $3,569, $2,824, and $2,691, respectively.
        At
        December 30, 2006, approximately 1,116,811 shares were available for future
        issuance.

        Share Repurchase Program

The
        Board
        of Directors approved a share repurchase program on August 3, 2006, authorizing
        the Company to purchase up to 3,000,000 of its common shares as market and
        business conditions warrant. The share repurchase authorization expires on
        December 31, 2007. As of December 30, 2006, the Company had repurchased
        1,155,300 shares using cash of $50,450. This amount was reported as a reduction
        in additional paid-in capital because companies incorporated in the Cayman
        Islands are not permitted by law to hold treasury stock.

The
        Board
        of Directors approved a share repurchase program on April 21, 2004, authorizing
        the Company to purchase up to 6,000,000 million of its common shares as market
        and business conditions warrant. The share repurchase authorization expired
        on
        April 30, 2006. From inception to expiration, 1,476,000 shares were repurchased
        and retired under this plan.

13.
        Shareholder Rights Plan

On
        October 24, 2001, Garmin’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
        (the “Rights Plan”). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend
        of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share of
        Garmin
        to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2001. The rights trade together
        with
        Garmin’s common shares. The rights generally will become exercisable if a person
        or group acquires or announces an intention to acquire 15% or more of Garmin’s
        outstanding common shares. Each right (other than those held by the new 15%
        shareholder) will then be exercisable to purchase preferred shares of Garmin
        (or
        in certain instances other securities of Garmin) having at that time a market
        value equal to two times the then current exercise price. Garmin’s Board of
        Directors may redeem the rights at $0.001 per right at any time before the
        rights become exercisable. The rights expire on October 31, 2011.

        Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited, split adjusted)

The

        quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management,
        all
        adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these
        interim periods presented have been included. These results are not necessarily
        indicative of future quarterly results.

        Dynastream Innovations Inc. Acquisition

On
        November 30, 2006, the Company acquired Dynastream Innovations Inc.
        (“Dynastream”) for $36.5 million. Dynastream, headquartered in Alberta, Canada,
        provides personal monitoring technology (such as foot pods and heart rate
        monitors) for sports and fitness products, and also provides low power and
        low
        cost wireless connectivity solutions. Dynastream products are used in some
        of
        the Company’s Forerunner devices. The purchase price was allocated primarily to
        technology/patents, customer contracts, goodwill and other assets, less
        liabilities assumed.

16.
        Warranty Reserves

The
        Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging
        from one to two years. The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
        obligations are based on historical experience and expectation of future
        conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. The following
        reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty
        reserve:

(a)
        Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
        Procedures

Under
        the
        supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
        Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the
        effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
        procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period
        covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
        and
        Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
        procedures are effective.

(b)
        Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
        Reporting

Management
        of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
        control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control
        over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
        regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
        financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
        of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
        financial reporting as of December 30, 2006. In making this assessment,
        management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
        Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated
        Framework”.

Based
        on
        such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
        maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
        30, 2006.

Ernst
        & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
        the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on
        management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial
        reporting. That attestation report appears below.

        Financial Reporting

The
        Board
        of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
        Ltd.

We
        have
        audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
        Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Garmin Ltd. and
        Subsidiaries maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
        as
        of December 30, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal
        Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
        of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
        financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
        control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
        on
        management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s
        internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
        conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
        Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
        we plan
        and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
        internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
        respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
        over
        financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
        the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
        such
        other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
        that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
        company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
        provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
        and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
        with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
        financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
        to
        the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
        reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
        provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
        to
        permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
        accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
        are
        being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
        of
        the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
        timely
        detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
        assets that could have a material effect on the financial
        statements.

Because
        of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
        not
        prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
        effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
        become
        inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
        with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
        our
        opinion, management’s assessment that Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
        is
        fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also,
        in
        our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects,
        effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2006,
        based on

the
        COSO
        criteria

.

We
        also
        have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
        Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin
        Ltd. and Subsidiaries

as
        of
        December 30, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements
        of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
        the period ended December 30, 2006 of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and our
        report dated February 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
        thereon.

        Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There
        were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
        year
        ended December 30, 2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
        likely
        to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting
