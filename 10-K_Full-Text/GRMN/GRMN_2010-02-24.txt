Company
Overview

Garmin is
a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communication and information
devices and applications, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System
(“GPS”) technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse
family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other
navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile,
outdoor/fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.


Overview
of the Global Positioning System

The
Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the
precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The
satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and
operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing
satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system
coverage.   Access to the system is provided free of charge by
the U.S. government.

Prior to
May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of
civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (‘‘SA’’) for
national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a
radius of 100 meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense
discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004, the
Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA
again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial
of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS
receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or
less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The
accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques
which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a
Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’) comprising ground reference stations
and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available
in the United States and portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3
meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal
and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased
accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers
for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS
system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was
available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics
equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference
stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Recent
Developments in the Company’s Business

Since the
inception of its business, Garmin has delivered over 65 million products, which
includes the delivery of nearly 17 million products during
2009.

Automotive/Mobile
Product Introductions

Garmin
introduced a number of new versions of Garmin’s popular

nüvi®

personal

nüvifone

G60
and M20 models were made available in select countries in Asia, Europe and North
America through retail channels and carriers.  The nüvifone G60 was
first available in July 2009 in Taiwan.  The nüvifone M20 became
available in August 2009 in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and
Malaysia.  The North America launch of the nüvifone G60 occurred in
October 2009 when AT&T announced that it would offer the device to its
customers in the United States.  This was followed by the first
western European carrier launch of the nüvifone G60 with Sunrise in
Switzerland.  Garmin also announced in 2009 that several other
nüvifone models are under development for 2010, including

devices with the Android
operating system. In addition, in 2009 Garmin introduced the zūmo® 660, which is
a new motorcycl

e device that integrates the slim and sleek design of the
nüvi with specific features made exclusively for motorcyclists.


Garmin
introduced nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that,
subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the
latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life
of their PND.

Competition

The
market for navigation, communications and information products is highly
competitive.  Garmin believes the principal competitive factors
impacting the market for its products are design, functionality, quality and
reliability, customer service, brand, price, time-to-market and
availability.  Garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in
each of these areas.

Garmin
believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are
TomTom N.V. and  MiTAC Digital Corporation (“MiTAC”) (which
distributes products under the brand names of Magellan, Mio, and Navman) and
Navigon AG. Garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor product
lines are Magellan, a subsidiary of MiTAC,  Lowrance Electronics,
Inc., a subsidiary of Navico (“Lowrance”) and Delorme and that its principal
competitors for fitness products are Nike, Inc., Polar Electro Oy, Suunto Oy and
Timex Corp.  For marine chartplotter products, Garmin believes that
its principal competitors are Raymarine Ltd. (“Raymarine”), Furuno Electronic
Company (“Furuno”), and Simrad and Lowrance (subsidiaries of
Navico).  For Garmin’s fishfinder/depth sounder product lines, Garmin
believes that its principal competitors are Lowrance, Raymarine, the Hummingbird
division of Johnson Outdoors, Inc., and Furuno. For Garmin’s general aviation
product lines, Garmin considers its principal competitors to be Honeywell, Inc.,
Avidyne Corporation, L-3 Avionics Systems, Rockwell Collins, Inc., Universal

Flight Systems for panel-mount GPS and display units.  For Garmin’s
Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service product line, Garmin
believes that its principal competitors are Motorola, Inc. (“Motorola”), Cobra
Electronics Corporation and Midland Radio Corporation.  Garmin
believes that its principal competitors for smartphones are Apple, Inc., HTC
Corporation, Nokia Oyj, Samsung Corporation, Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications
AB, Google, Inc., Motorola, LG Electronics, Palm, Inc., and Research in Motion,
Ltd.

Research
and Development

Garmin’s
product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and
development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and
manufacturing teams.  Garmin’s products are created by its engineering
and development staff, which numbered 1,969 people worldwide as of December 26,
2009.  Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process
engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure
manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s
development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers,
electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic
engineers.  Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has
played an important role in Garmin’s success.  Once a development
project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to
design the product and transition it into manufacturing.

Below is
a table of Garmin’s expenditures on research and development over the last three
fiscal years.

Manufacturing
and Operations

Garmin
believes that one of its core competencies is its manufacturing capability at
its Shijr, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility,
and its Salem, Oregon facility.  Garmin believes that its vertically
integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all
products other than the nüvifone products, which are manufactured by one or more
third parties as part of the Garmin-Asus strategic alliance, and our accessory
products, which are also manufactured by one or more third
parties:


Reduced
time-to-market.

Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s
products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the
feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass
production begins.  In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time
required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries,
with improved quality and yields.

Design and
process optimization.

Garmin uses its manufacturing resources
to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve
higher efficiency, lower cost and better value for
customers.  Garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and
manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to
minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and
rugged.

Logistical
agility.

Operating its own manufacturing facilities
helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages and long component
lead times which are common in the electronics industry.  Many
products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and
the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.  Garmin reacts
rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of
long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to
another.

Garmin’s
design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan,
and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard
developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s Taiwan
manufacturing facilities have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality
standard for automotive suppliers.  In addition, Garmin’s aviation
operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the
aviation industry.

Garmin
(Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their
environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.  This
certification recognizes that Garmin’s UK and Taiwan subsidiaries have systems
and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment
and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Although
most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from
multiple sources,  Certain key components including but not limited to
microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays (“LCDs”), and certain
 application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) are currently obtained
by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects the Company
to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that
are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash
memory, dynamic random access memory (“DRAM”), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs,
are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing
fluctuations.

The Company and other participants in
the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer
electronics industries also compete for various components with other
industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In
addition, the Company uses some custom components that are not common to the
rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer
electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has
evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies,
additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured
or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of a key
single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher
prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products
to the Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating results could be
materially adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance
could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those
suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead
of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.


Seasonality

Our sales are subject to significant
seasonal fluctuation.  Sales of our consumer products are generally
significantly higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand for
automotive/mobile products during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser
extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer
marine season and the Father’s Day/graduation buying season.  Sales of
consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new
products.  Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal
variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products
when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

Our sales are generally of a consumer
nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and
shipment.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to the understanding of our business.  We typically ship most
orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual
Property

Our
success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary
technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark
and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and
protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of
intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains
licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various
sources.

As
of January 21, 2010, Garmin’s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 400 patents
and 250 trademark registrations.  Garmin was selected as a constituent of
the 2009 Ocean Tomo® 300 Patent Index and the 2009 Wall Street Journal®
Electronic & Instruments Patent Scorecard, both of which are indices that
recognize companies with high intellectual property value. We believe that our
continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their
ability to continue to innovate.  Garmin will continue to file and
prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s
rights in its proprietary technologies.

There is
no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire,
may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also
possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive
advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing
and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to
obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to
protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or
invalidity.


Regulations

The
telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment
in which Garmin operates is subject to change.  In accordance with
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless
transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the
FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are
sold.  Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with
relevant directives of the European Commission.  A delay in receiving
required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products,
or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect
our business.    In addition, aviation products that are
intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be
certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety
Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an
aircraft.

Because
Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in
Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to
remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s
operations.  The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and
regulations thereunder, provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be
executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance
of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also
referred to as the CBC.  Current regulations favor trade-related
foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from
exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by
exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and
services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange
banks.  Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan
companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside
and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million
respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.  Currency
conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not
have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.  The above limits apply
to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S.
Dollars or other foreign currencies.  The CBC typically approves
foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for
review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency
conversion.  A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to
register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.

Environmental
Matters

The
European Union (“EU”) enacted the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous
Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive ("RoHS Directive")
and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE Directive”).
The RoHS Directive requires EU member states to enact laws prohibiting the use
of certain substances, including lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium,
in certain electronic products put on the market after July 1, 2006. The WEEE
Directive requires EU member states to enact laws that were to go into effect by
August 13, 2005 regulating the collection, recovery and recycling of waste from
certain electronic products. We modified the design of our products and our
manufacturing processes and are participating in the collection and recycling
programs in order to comply with such laws and regulations.  The EU is
reviewing the RoHS Directive, and an amended version – “RoHS II” – is expected
to be adopted in the Spring of 2010.  While the basic objective should
remain the same, it is expected that RoHS II will provide clearer directives and
complement other EU legislation by using similar methodologies.

The EU
has also enacted the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of
Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation.  REACH requires manufacturers and importers
of articles to register the substances contained in the articles if the
substances are intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable
conditions of use.  Because the substances contained in our products are
not intended to be released under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of
use, we do not believe we or the importers of our products have an obligation
under REACH to register those substances.  It is possible, however, that
Garmin could participate in the REACH regulations as necessary to support
possible REACH registration requirements of the recyclers of our products. 
REACH also imposes notification and restriction requirements on manufacturers
and importers of articles if the articles contain “substances of very high
concern.”  We have established a program in order to comply when and to the
extent necessary.  In January 2010, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)
formally added 14 chemicals to the REACH Candidate List of Substances of Very
High Concern (SVHC), which brings the total number of chemicals on the SVHC
Candidate List to 28.  Under the REACH regulations, producers and
importers of a chemical on the Candidate List whose quantities in the
produced/imported articles are above 1 metric ton in total per year and in a
concentration that exceeds 0.1% weight by weight (w/w) will be required to
notify the European Chemical Agency with information pertaining to its use by
June 1, 2011. Garmin is currently gathering information from its suppliers as to
whether any of the chemicals listed on the January 2010 SVHC list are contained
in any articles purchased from such suppliers.  Garmin is continuing
an ongoing effort to obtain information necessary for Garmin to evaluate any
possible notification responsibilities.


AC/DC
adapters included as an accessory with certain Garmin products or sold as an
option for battery charging of many portable Garmin products will require
submissions of energy-use profiles in accordance with the EU EuP (Energy Using
Products) Directive.  Garmin is modifying the design and energy-use
profiles of our adapters in order to comply with applicable laws and
regulations.  Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy has
promulgated a regulation pertaining to external power supplies and compliance
with the energy efficiency standards that were established under the Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007.  We will be addressing these
requirements as necessary.

Garmin
products may also become subject to further energy efficiency requirements if
and when required under U.S. Federal climate change legislation.

In June
2009 the California Air Resources Board adopted proposed regulations to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions which would begin phasing in starting with
2012 model-year vehicles that would require vehicles sold in
California to have solar reflective window glazing that may interfere with
the reception of GPS satellite signals by portable navigation
devices.

The
People’s Republic of China has enacted legislation which is widely known as
“China RoHS”.  The first phase of China RoHS took effect on March 1,
2007 and requires the disclosure and marking of certain substances, including
lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium in certain electronic
products.  We have established a program in order to comply with the
first phase of China RoHS.

Other
states and countries have promulgated or proposed legislation similar to the
RoHS Directive and/or the WEEE Directive.  The need for and cost of
our compliance with such legislation cannot yet be fully determined but the cost
could be substantial.

Several
states have enacted laws pertaining to the reduction of mercury in products and
the labeling of mercury-containing products, including the member states of the
Interstate Mercury Education and Reduction Clearinghouse
(IMERC).  Some of these laws, including those in Connecticut, New
York, Vermont and Louisiana, are applicable to certain of Garmin’s GPS
products.  We have established an ongoing compliance program to ensure
that we are fulfilling the notice and labeling requirements set forth in the
relevant mercury legislation.

Garmin
has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (“EMS”) policies in
accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001
standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS
policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance
with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas
headquarters facility, Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s
Taiwan manufacturing facility.

Regulatory
and “Green Procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing,
particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and
environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.  The
overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be
established.  Garmin is committed to improving our products and
processes to meet our customer needs.


Employees

As of
December 31, 2009, Garmin had 8,437 full and part-time employees worldwide,
of whom 2,948 were in the United States, 68 were in Canada, 4,727 were in
Taiwan, 623 were in Europe, and 71 were in other global
locations.   Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Brazil,
Iceland and Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor
union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a
collective bargaining agreement.  Garmin considers its employee
relations to be good.

Item
1A.  Risk Factors

The
risks described below are not the only ones facing our
company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us
or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business
operations.  If any of the following risks occur, our business,
financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely
affected.

Risks
Related to the Company

The
demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) may be eroded by replacement
technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems
in new autos.

We
have experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has
resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing
devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed
systems.  Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many
companies are now offering navigation software for mobile
devices.  The acceptance of this technology by consumers could slow
our growth and further reduce margins.  Navigation systems are also
becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new
automobiles.  Increased navigation penetration on new automobiles
could slow our growth and further reduce margins.

Our
financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which
now represents approximately 70% of our revenues and may be maturing leading to
lesser growth than we have experienced in the past.

We
have experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our
business in recent years as the products have become mass-market consumer
electronics in both Europe and North America.  This market growth may
now be slowing as penetration rates increase and competing technologies
emerge.  Slowing growth, along with the significant price reductions
that have occurred during the past three years, could result in lower
revenues.  As margins have also declined in this segment, slowing
growth may also result in lower earnings per share.

Economic
conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and
margins

Our
revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the
demand for products in the markets in which we compete.  The current
economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in
decreased revenue and may in the future result in decreased revenue and problems
with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In
addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers
have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt
write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an
adverse affect on our results of operations.


Gross
margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Gross
margins on our automotive/mobile products were declining prior to 2009 and are
expected to decline in 2010 due to price reductions in the increasingly
competitive market for personal navigation devices (PNDs) that are not offset by
material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate
from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix,
competition and unit volumes.  In particular, the average selling
prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s
life.  To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on
component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost
reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new
products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher
average selling prices.  However, there can be no assurance that we
will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or
introduce any such new products in the future.  To the extent that
such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely
manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Changes
in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law
could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We do not
believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a
‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for United States federal income tax
purposes.  We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment
company.  However, because the passive foreign investment company
determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets
meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles
which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we
cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in
the future.  If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year,
then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to
pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some
distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a
gain.  Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment
company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we
generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company
with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether
we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.

We do not
believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a
Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax
purposes.  We do not expect to become a CFC.  The CFC
determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own
more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the
Company.  Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of
the voting power of the Company’s shares qualify as United States
shareholders.  If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an
uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company’s shareholders that
qualify as United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at
ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the
Company’s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC. As
the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company’s stock nor can the
Company control which shareholders participate in the Company’s stock buyback
program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders
which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.

Legislative
proposals have been considered in the United States within the past year that
could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international
operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations
could be considered resident in the United States   Our tax
position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax
laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement
thereof by any tax authority. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific
legislative proposals.

Best
Buy is a significant customer, representing over 10% of net sales. 
Accordingly, our revenues and profitability will be adversely impacted if Best
Buy’s business declines or if Best Buy is unable to pay us amounts owed
timely.

Best Buy
is our largest customer and accounted for 13.4% and 12.0% of our total net sales
in 2009 and 2008, respectively.  If Best Buy’s business declines due to the
economic conditions, market share losses or other factors, our revenues and
profitability will be adversely impacted.  In addition, if Best Buy’s
liquidity erodes for any of the reasons discussed above or a tightening in the
credit markets and they are unwilling or unable to pay us amounts owed timely,
our profitability will be adversely impacted.


If
we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely
manufacture of new products, demand for our products could
decrease.

We expect
that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived
from sales of newly introduced products.  The market for our products
is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and
changes in customer needs.  If we fail to introduce new products, or
to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in
technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly
become less competitive or obsolete.  We must continue to make
significant investments in research and development in order to continue to
develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance
for such products.  However, there can be no assurance that
development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will
achieve significant customer acceptance.

If we are
unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and
enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be
adversely affected.  Our pursuit of necessary technology may require
substantial time and expense.  We may need to license new technologies
to respond to technological change.  These licenses may not be
available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross
profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in
adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.  Development
and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict,
and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer
shipments of new products.  The timely availability of these products
in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future
success.  From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping
certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product
development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in
regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

If
we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our
resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer
customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The
markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to
increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater
financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  These
competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies
or changes in customer requirements.  They may also be able to devote
greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their
products.  Increased competition could result in price reductions,
fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.  Our
failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could
seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We
rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and
disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because
we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we
are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and
support for our products.  In particular, our dealers and distributors
maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.  If
dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they
do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be
negatively impacted.

Many of
our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our
competitors.  If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors
more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline
to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a
sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.  If we are
unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to
expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.

Our
quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and
seasonality.

Our
operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating
results may fluctuate significantly.  If such operating results
decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.  As we expand
our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and
research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our
sales.  If revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs
rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.


Historically,
our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have
recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter.  Our devices
are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in
these quarters.  Sales of certain of our marine and automotive

products tend to be
higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such
products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel
season.  Sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher
in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on
electronic devices during the holiday season.

In addition, we attempt
to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer
spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these
seasonal variations.

Our
quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency
translation.

The
operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure
to movements in currency exchange rates.  We have experienced
significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and
weakening of the U.S. dollar.  The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our
results of operations.

The currencies that create a majority
of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British
Pound Sterling.  Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Shijr, Taiwan,
uses the local currency as the functional currency.  The Company
translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and
expense accounts at average rates during the year.  In order to
minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we
have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in
marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the
Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars
all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan
subsidiary.  This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is
the functional currency of the subsidiary.  This U.S. GAAP-mandated
translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements
as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.  Such gain or
loss will create variations in our earnings per share.  Because there
is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will
continue to focus on the Company’s operating performance before the impact of
the foreign currency translation.

If
we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to
secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we
could have costly excess production or inventories.

We have
generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing
demand.  However, the demand for our products depends on many factors
and will be difficult to forecast.  We expect that it will become more
difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as
competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for
some of our products mature to the mass market category.  Significant
unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our
operations:

Ÿ

If
      demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly
      increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional
      volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase
      production rapidly enough to meet unexpected
  demand.

Ÿ

Rapid increases in
      production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher
      costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other
      expenses.  These higher costs could lower our profit
      margins.  Further, if production is increased rapidly,
      manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and
      reduce customer
satisfaction.


Ÿ

If
      forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production
      resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which
      would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess
      inventories.  Lower than forecasted demand could also result in
      excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our
      facilities, which could result in lower
margins.

We
have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on
certain high technology capital investments that may not always be
available.

Our
effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, because we
have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology
investments in Taiwan.  The loss of these tax benefits could have a
significant effect on our financial results in the future.

We
may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies
that operate in Taiwan.

Relations
between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC,
and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in
the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our
shares.  Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture
all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in
Taiwan.

Taiwan
has a unique international political status.  The PRC asserts
sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all
of mainland China.  The PRC government does not recognize the
legitimacy of the Taiwan government.  Although significant economic
and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan
and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to
gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of
independence by Taiwan.  Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on
occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could
negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.

Our
intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could
suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by
others.

We rely
on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets,
confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights.  To this end, we hold rights to a number of
patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to
protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.  However, there
is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that
our trademark applications will become registered
trademarks.  Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may
thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated
for a variety of reasons.   Thus, any patents or trademarks we
currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive
advantage.

Third
parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property
rights.  Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our
business and financial condition.  From time to time we receive
letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual
property rights.  Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual
property is costly and time consuming.  We may seek licenses from such
parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially
unreasonable terms.  We might not have sufficient resources to pay for
the licenses.  Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur
substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical
technologies or processes or the production or sale of major
products.


We
may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If our
aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions
or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or
death.  Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational
products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal
injury or death.  If our automotive or marine products contain defects
or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users
do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or
accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or
death.  If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to
significant liability for personal injury and property damage and under certain
circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.  We
maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our
products.  However, there can be no assurance that such insurance
would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such
insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable
rates.  In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover
awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees
and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.  If we are
unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if
our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially
adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

We
depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific
components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are
not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the
costs of components rise.

We are
dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current
products.  Some of the components that we procure from third party
suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal
displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.  The cost,
quality and availability of components are essential to the successful
production and sale of our products.  Some components we use are from
sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits
incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source
suppliers.  Alternative sources may not be currently available for
these sole source components.

In the
past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other
components.  In addition, if there are shortages in supply of
components, the costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to
meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain
an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive,
or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and
cost-effective production of our products would be seriously
harmed.

We
depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our
automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be
harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the
royalty costs for such data rise.

We
license digital mapping data for use in our products from various
sources.  There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data
for each geographical region.  The two largest digital map suppliers
are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V.  NAVTEQ Corporation is
owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V.  Nokia
and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.

Although
we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing
due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in
November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2015 with an
option to extend through 2019), if we are unable to continue licensing such
mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of
our relationships with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply
mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.

We
may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other
ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully
identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We intend
to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in
complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into
strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets,
additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing
synergies or additional industry expertise.  We may not be able to
identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates,
or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to
complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at
all.


Any past
or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired
employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions),
operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention
away from other business issues and opportunities.  Integration of
acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology
and inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key personnel of the
acquired company may decide not to work for us.  We may not
successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or
products related to acquisitions we have made in previous years  or
may make in the future.  If we fail to successfully integrate such
transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

We
may have additional tax liabilities.

We are
subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign
jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are
many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is
uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe
our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any
related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax
provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a
material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the
period or periods for which that determination is made.

Our
shareholders may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are
incorporated under Cayman Islands law.

Our
corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles of Association, as
amended, and by the Companies Law (2009 Revision) and the common law of the
Cayman Islands.  The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary
responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly
established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in
jurisdictions in the United States.  Therefore, you may have more
difficulty in protecting your interests in the face of actions by the
management, directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of
a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the United States, due to the
comparatively less developed nature of Cayman Islands law in this
area.

Shareholders
of Cayman Islands exempted companies such as Garmin have no general rights under
Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts or to obtain copies
of lists of shareholders of the company. This may make it more difficult for you
to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a
shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection
with a proxy contest.

Subject
to limited exceptions, under Cayman Islands law, a minority shareholder may not
bring a derivative action against the board of directors. Our Cayman Islands
counsel has advised that they are not aware of any reported class action or
derivative action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court.

Failure
to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm
our business.

We have
certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to
governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.  For
example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are
intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.  To the
extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that
requires significant focus and resources.  An inability to obtain, or
excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect
on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products,
our customers’ ability to sell airplanes.  Therefore, such inabilities
or delays could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we cannot
assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.  Any
such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating
results.


Our
business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified
personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our
future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key
executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative
personnel.  We currently do not have employment agreements with any of
our key executive officers.  We do not have key man life insurance on
any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such
insurance.  The loss of the services of any of our senior level
management, or other key employees, could harm our
business.  Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require
to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.  For
example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified
electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design
and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to
recruit such personnel.  If we fail to hire and retain qualified
employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

There
is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil
liabilities in the Cayman Islands and Taiwan.

We are a
Cayman Islands company and a substantial portion of our assets are located
outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.  As a result, it
may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon
us.  In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the
Cayman Islands or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States
courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the
securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to
hear original actions brought in the Cayman Islands or Taiwan against us
predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state
thereof.

A
shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation
would harm our business.

Following the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be
grounded for several days.  In addition to this shut down of U.S.
airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional
restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual
Flight Rules (VFR).  The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced
Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the
USA) airspace areas.  The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
(AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general
aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace
areas.  The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general
aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots
are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

The shutdown of U.S. airspace following
September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and
delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing
facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely
affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and
distributors.

Any
future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general
aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.

Many
of our products rely on the Global Positioning System

The
Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system
consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.  The satellites
and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by
the United States Department of Defense.  The Department of Defense
does not currently charge users for access to the satellite
signals.  These satellites and their ground support systems are
complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and
possible sabotage. The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5
years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they
operate.  However, of the current deployment of satellites in place,
some have been operating for more than 12 years.


If a
significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are
not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning
System products and would have a material negative effect on our
business.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S.
government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of Global
Positioning System satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the
U.S. government that provide for the use of the Global Positioning System
without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain
unchanged.  Because of the increasing commercial applications of the
Global Positioning System, other U.S. government agencies may become involved in
the administration or the regulation of the use of Global Positioning System
signals.    However, in a presidential policy statement
issued in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. is
committed to supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will
continue providing it free from direct user fees.

Some of
our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide
Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  WAAS is operated by the FAA. Any
curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could result in decreased user
capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our
markets.

Any of
the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to
select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on
competing technologies.

Any
reallocation of radio frequency spectrum could cause interference with the
reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm our
business.

Our
Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard
Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning
System satellites.  The Global Positioning System operates in radio
frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite
services.  The assignment of spectrum is controlled by an
international organization known as the International Telecommunications Union
(‘‘ITU’’).  The Federal Communications Commission (‘‘FCC’’) is
responsible for the assignment of spectrum for non-government use in the United
States in accordance with ITU regulations.  Any ITU or FCC
reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation
or sharing of spectrum, could cause interference with the reception of Global
Positioning System signals and may materially and adversely affect the utility
and reliability of our products, which would, in turn, have a material adverse
effect on our operating results.  In addition, emissions from mobile
satellite service and other equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or
inband may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our
products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our operating
results.
The  FCC  continually  receives  proposals  for  new
technologies and services, such as
ultra-wideband  technologies,  which may seek to operate in,
or across,  the radio  frequency  bands currently
used by the GPS SPS.  Adverse  decisions by the FCC that
result in harmful interference to the delivery of the GPS SPS
may  materially  and  adversely  affect
the utility  and  reliability  of
our  products,  which  could  result in
a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Our
business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or
terrorism

Acts of
war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have
a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial
condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military
response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a
redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To
the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and
financial condition.

We
may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate
change.

Climate
change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.  Some scientists,
legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of
greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant
legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas
emissions.


There are
a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse
gas emissions. For example, in June 2009 the U.S. House of Representatives
passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act that would phase-in
significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law. The U.S.
Senate is considering a different bill, and it is uncertain whether, when and in
what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be
adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol. These
actions could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for
components used in the manufacture of our products and freight
costs.

In June 2009 the California Air Resources Board adopted proposed regulations to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions which would begin phasing in starting with 2012
model-year vehicles that would require vehicles sold in California to have solar
reflective window glazing that may interfere with the reception of GPS satellite
signals by portable navigation devices.

Because
it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the
potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Risks
Relating to Our Shares

The
volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common
shares.

The
market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly
volatile.  During 2009, the price of our common shares ranged from a
low of $15.17 to a high of $39.58. A variety of factors could cause the price of
our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

announcements
      and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our
      suppliers or the markets in which we
compete;

·

quarterly
      fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating
    results;

·

the
      availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as
      flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in
      our  products;

·

general
      conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest
      rates;

·

announcements
      of technological innovations;

·

new
      products or product enhancements by us or our
  competitors;

·

product
      obsolescence and our ability to manage product
  transitions;

·

developments
      in patents or other intellectual property rights and
      litigation;

·

developments
      in our relationships with our customers and
  suppliers;

·

research
      reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses
      related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers;
      and

·

any
      significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or
      significant markets where we sell our
products.

In
addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares
of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of
affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in the future could
adversely affect the market price of our common shares, and the market price of
our common shares may decline.

Our
officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As of
January 25, 2010 members and former members of our Board of Directors and our
executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that
may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially
owned approximately 43.3% of our outstanding common
shares.  Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the
outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and
acquisitions.  This level of ownership may have a significant effect
in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may
adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common
shares.


Provisions
in our shareholder rights plan and our charter documents might deter, delay or
prevent a third party from acquiring us and Cayman Islands corporate law may
impede a takeover, which could decrease the value of our shares.

Our Board
of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 preferred shares and to
determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including
voting rights, of those shares without any further vote or action by the
shareholders.  This could have an adverse impact on the market price
of our common shares.  We have no present plans to issue any preferred
shares, but we may do so.  The rights of the holders of common shares
may be subject to, and adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any
preferred shares that may be issued in the future.  In addition, we
have adopted a classified board of directors.  Our shareholders are
unable to remove any director or the entire board of directors without a super
majority vote.  In addition, a super majority vote is required to
approve transactions with interested shareholders.  Shareholders do
not have the right to call a shareholders’ meeting.  We have adopted a
shareholders’ rights plan which under certain circumstances would significantly
impair the ability of third parties to acquire control of us without prior
approval of our Board of Directors.  This shareholders’ rights plan
and the provisions in our charter documents could make it more difficult for a
third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our
shareholders.

The
Cayman Islands have recently introduced provisions to the Companies Law (2009
Revision) to facilitate mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands
companies and non-Cayman Islands companies.  These provisions,
contained within Part XVI of the Companies Law (2009 Revision), are broadly
similar to the merger provisions as provided for under Delaware
Law.

There are
however a number of important material differences that could impede a takeover.
First, the thresholds for approval of the merger plan by shareholders are
higher. The thresholds are (a) a shareholder resolution by majority in number
representing 75% in value of the shareholders voting together as one class or
(b) if the shares to be issued to each shareholder in the consolidated or
surviving company are to have the same rights and economic value as the shares
held in the constituent company, a special resolution of the shareholders (being
75% of those present in person in person or by proxy and voting) voting together
as one class.

As it is
would not be expected that the shares would have the same rights and economic
value following a takeover by way of merger, it is expected that the first test
is the one which would commonly apply. This threshold essentially has three
requirements. First "a majority in number" of the shareholders must approve;
secondly such majority must hold 75% "in value" of all the outstanding shares
and thirdly the shareholders must vote together as one class.

Secondly
the consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest (in essence
a documented security interest as opposed to one arising by operation of law) is
required to be obtained unless the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands waives such
requirement.

The
merger provisions contained within Part XVI of the Companies Law (2009 Revision)
do contain shareholder appraisal rights similar to that as provided for under
Delaware law.  Such rights are limited to a merger under Part XVI and
do apply to schemes of arrangement as discussed below.


The
Companies Law (2009 Revision) also contains separate statutory provisions that
provide for the merger, reconstruction and amalgamation of companies, which are
commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of
arrangement.”  The procedural and legal requirements necessary to
consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than
the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States.
Under Cayman Islands law and practice, a scheme of arrangement in relation to a
solvent Cayman Islands exempted company must be approved at a shareholders’
meeting by a majority of each class of the company’s shareholders who are
present and voting (either in person or by proxy) at such meeting. The shares
voted in favor of the scheme of arrangement must also represent at least 75% of
the value of each relevant class of the company’s shareholders (excluding the
shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement) present and voting at
the meeting. The Grand Court of the Cayman Islands must also sanction the
convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation. Although there is
no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in
the scheme of arrangement, the Grand Court typically seeks to ensure that the
creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving
entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely
affect the creditors’ interests. Furthermore, the Grand Court will only approve
a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that:

•

the
      statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied
      with;

•

the
      shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in
      question;

•

the
      scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve;
      and

•

the
      scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned
      under some other provision of the Companies Law (2009
      Revision)

If the
scheme of arrangement is approved, the dissenting shareholder would have no
rights comparable to appraisal rights, which would otherwise ordinarily be
available to dissenting shareholders of U.S. corporations, providing rights to
receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the
shares.

In
addition, if an offer by a third party to purchase shares in us has been
approved by the holders of at least 90% of our outstanding shares (not including
such third party) pursuant to an offer within a four-month period of making such
an offer, the purchaser may, during the two months following expiration of the
four-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer their
shares on the same terms on which the purchaser acquired the first 90% of our
outstanding shares. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman
Islands, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad
faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders.

3.  Legal Proceedings

Encyclopaedia
Britannica, Inc. v. Alpine Electronics of America, Inc., Alpine Electronics,
Inc., Denso Corporation, Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., American Honda Motor
Co., Inc., and Garmin International, Inc.

On May
16, 2005, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. (“Encyclopaedia Britannica”) filed suit
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, Austin
Division, against Garmin International, Inc. and five other unrelated companies,
alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 5,241,671 (“the ’671 patent”). On
December 30, 2005, Garmin International filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for
Claim Invalidity Based on Indefiniteness. On September 30, 2008, the court
issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order granting Garmin International’s Motion for
Summary Judgment for Claim Invalidity Based on Indefiniteness with respect to
the ’671 patent. On October 8, 2008, the court issued an Amended Final Judgment
ordering that Encyclopaedia Britannica take nothing from its action against
Garmin International with respect to the ’671 patent and closed that case. On
November 12, 2008, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed a Notice of Appeal to the
Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. On December 4, 2009, the Federal Circuit
issued its decision affirming the district court’s judgment.

On May
23, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed an amended complaint claiming that
Garmin International and the other defendants also infringe U.S. Patent No.
7,051,018 (“the ‘018 patent”), a continuation patent of the ‘671 patent, which
issued on May 23, 2006. On July 25, 2006, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed a new
complaint claiming that Garmin International and the other defendants also
infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,082,437 (“the ‘437 patent”), a continuation patent of
the ‘671 patent, which issued on July 25, 2006. Encyclopaedia Britannica also
asserted the ’018 and ’437 patents against other parties in a separate lawsuit,

Encyclopaedia Britannica v.
Magellan Navigation, Inc

., et al., Case No. 07-CA-787 (LY)(W.D.
Tex).


On
February 6, 2009, the court entered a scheduling order enabling all defendants
in these cases to file a consolidated Joint Motion for Summary Judgment of
Invalidity of the ’018 and ’437 patents and stayed all proceedings pending the
court’s ruling on the joint motion for summary judgment. On February 20, 2009,
the defendants filed a consolidated Joint Motion for Summary Judgment of
Invalidity of the ’018 and ’437 patents. On August 3, 2009, the court issued a
Memorandum Opinion and Order granting the defendants’ consolidated Joint Motion
for Summary Judgment of Invalidity of the ’018 and ’437 patents and holding that
these patents are invalid. On August 24, 2009, Encyclopaedia Britannica filed a
Notice of Appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of
Appeals.    Garmin International believes the Federal
Circuit will affirm the district court’s judgment.

SP
Technologies, LLC v. Garmin Ltd., Garmin International, Inc., TomTom, Inc., and
Magellan Navigation, Inc.

On June
5, 2008, SP Technologies, LLC filed suit in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois against Garmin Ltd. and Garmin International,
Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,784,873 (“the ’873 patent”). On
July 7, 2008, SP Technologies, LLC filed an amended complaint removing all
claims against Garmin Ltd. and alleging infringement of the ’873 patent against
additional defendants TomTom, Inc. and Magellan Navigation, Inc. Garmin believes
that it should not be found liable for infringement of the ’873 patent and
additionally that the ’873 patent is invalid. On August 18, 2008, Garmin filed
its answer to the amended complaint along with a motion for dismissal of SP
Technologies, LLC’s claims of willful and inducement infringement of the ’873
patent. On October 16, 2008, the court granted Garmin’s motion for partial
dismissal, striking the willful and inducement infringement allegations from the
amended complaint.

On
January 7, 2009, Garmin filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaims asserting the
’873 patent is not infringed, is invalid, and that the plaintiff committed
inequitable conduct resulting in unenforceability of the ’873 patent. On
February 2, 2009, codefendant TomTom, Inc. filed a Motion for Summary Judgment
of Unenforceability of the ’873 Patent Due to Inequitable Conduct. On September
30, 2009, the Court denied TomTom, Inc.’s Motion for Summary Judgment. On
October 9, 2009, the Court issued an order construing the claims of the ’873
patent. On October 28, 2009, Garmin filed a Motion for Summary Judgment of
Invalidity of the ’873 Patent.  On January 6, 2010, SP Technologies,
LLC filed its response and on January 20, 2010, Garmin filed its
reply.  The parties await the court’s ruling on Garmin’s
motion.  Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable
outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our
operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes that the
claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this
lawsuit.

invalidity of the ‘892 Patent and the ‘681 Patent.  Although there can
be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a

this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future
events.  Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by
their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs
or conjugations of such verbs.  If any of our assumptions on which the
statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances
arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such
forward-looking statements.  The differences could be caused by a
number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited to, those
discussed above in Item 1A.  Readers are strongly encouraged to
consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking
statement.  We do not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal year is a 52-53 week
period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  Fiscal year
2005 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks for fiscal years 2009, 2008, 2007,
and 2006.  Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the
Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods.  Unless the context
otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar
terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated, dollar
amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share
data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide provider of
navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by
Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.  We operate in four
business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor/fitness, automotive/mobile,
and aviation markets.  Our segments offer products through our network
of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and
distributors.  However, the nature of products and types of customers
for the four segments can vary significantly.  As such, the segments
are managed separately.  Our portable GPS receivers and accessories
for marine, recreation/fitness and automotive/mobile segments are sold primarily
to retail outlets.  Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount
avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are
sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft
manufacturers.

Since our first products were delivered
in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have
funded our growth from these profits.  Our sales have increased at a
compounded annual growth rate of 30% since 2005 and our net income has increased
at a compounded annual growth rate of 23% since 2005.  The vast
majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of new
revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of MotionBased Technologies LLC
in 2005, Dynastream Innovations Inc. in 2006, Digital Cyclone, Inc. and the
assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc. in 2007, and ten European distributors
in 2007 and 2008.  These acquisitions had no significant impact on net
income for those years.

Since our principal locations are in
the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience some foreign currency
fluctuations in our operating results.  While the U.S. Dollar remains
the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., the functional currency of all
other European operations excluding Garmin Danmark and Garmin Sweden is the Euro
(effective July 2007) and the functional currency of Garmin Corporation,
headquartered in Taiwan, is the Taiwan Dollar.  Approximately 79% of
sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds
Sterling or the Euro.  We experienced ($6.0) million, ($35.3) million,
and $23.0 million in foreign currency gains (losses) during fiscal years 2009,
2008, and 2007, respectively.  The 2008 foreign currency loss includes
a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of the Euro between
the date we purchased shares in Tele Atlas N.V. in October 2007 and the tender
of shares in February, March, and June 2008.  To date, we have not
entered into hedging transactions with the Euro, the British Pound Sterling, or
the Taiwan Dollar, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions
in the future.


Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion and analysis of its
financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The
presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities.  On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates,
including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product
returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes,
warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.  Garmin bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Revenue
Recognition

Garmin recognizes revenue when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales
price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.  For the large
majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and
title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company
recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with
hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance
with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes
revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for
standalone sales of software products and sales of software bundled with
hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.  The Company
generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its
customers in connection with software sales.

Garmin
introduced nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that,
subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the
latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life
of their PND.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of
nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized
ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated three-year life of
the products.

For multi-element arrangements that
include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the
tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate
to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to
all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,
the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling
price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows:
(i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”),
(ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and (iii) best
estimate of the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the
Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by
the Company for that deliverable.


In 2009,
Garmin introduced the nüvi 1690, a premium PND with a built‐in wireless module
that lets customers access Garmin’s nüLink!™ service, which provides direct
links to certain online information.  The Company has identified two
deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690. The
first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of
the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is
the nüLink service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two
deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
  Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related
essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  Amounts allocated to the
nüLink services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
24-month life of the service.

Garmin
records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and
incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts
offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories
in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based
incentives.   The reductions to revenue are based on estimates
and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future
conditions.   Changes in these estimates could negatively affect
Garmin’s operating results.   These incentives are reviewed
periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other
promotions, are accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.   If
market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer
incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered.

Garmin records reductions to revenue
for expected future product returns based on Garmin’s historical
experience.

Trade
Accounts Receivable

We sell
our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit
based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition.  Potential
losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial
condition. We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.
Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 60 days and do not bear
interest. We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain
allowances for potential losses or adjustments. We determine these allowances by
(1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk
customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal
collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount
due.

Warranties

Garmin’s products are generally covered
by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years. Garmin accrues a
warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty
services.  Garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty
obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future
conditions.  To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim
activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty
accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.

Inventory

Garmin writes down its inventory for
estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between
the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions
about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional
inventory write-downs may be required.


Investments

Investments
are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized
investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’
equity.   Investment income is recorded when earned, and capital
gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.   Fair
value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party
estimates which followed an income approach valuation
methodology.  Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if
they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than
temporary.   If investments are determined to be impaired, a
capital loss is recognized at the date of determination.

Testing
for impairment of investments also requires significant management
judgment.   The identification of potentially impaired
investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether
any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment
elements.   The discovery of new information and the passage of
time can significantly change these judgments.    Revisions
of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any
resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.  The economic
environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of
determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.

Income
Taxes

Garmin provides deferred tax assets and
liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as
measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse.    It is Garmin’s
policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an
amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.  While
Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the
event Garmin were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part
of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax
assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is
made.  Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to
realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded
amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the
period such determination is made.

In addition, the calculation of our tax
liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex
tax regulations.  We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the
U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  If payment of these
amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities
would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine
the liabilities are no longer necessary.  If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to
expense would result.

Stock
Based Compensation

Garmin awards stock options, stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance
shares each year as part of Garmin’s compensation package for
employees.  Employees with certain levels of responsibility within
Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance
shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at
the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is
not a contractual obligation.

Stock-based compensation cost is
measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is
recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair
value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including
estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in
estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.
If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based
compensation expense could be impacted.

Stock
compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.


Accounting
Terms and Characteristics

Net
Sales

Our net sales are primarily generated
through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original
equipment manufacturers.  Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion
above. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore backlog levels
are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.  We aim to
achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most
orders within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject to seasonal
fluctuation.  Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in
the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season,
and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying
season.  Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal
variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products
when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Gross
Profit

Raw material costs are our most
significant component of cost of goods sold.  In 2009, gross margin
for our automotive/mobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from
raw material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average
selling price decline.  In 2008, gross margin for our
automotive/mobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price
continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to
lower-margin product groups.  These impacts were somewhat offset by
raw material price declines, most significantly flash memory.  In the
first half of 2007, we experienced favorable product mix and product pricing,
which allowed us to hold margins in our automotive/mobile segment steady; margin
declines in the second half of 2007 were primarily a result of average selling
price declines, coupled with raw materials price increases, most notably the
costs for flash memory, in late second quarter and through the third quarter of
2007 when we were purchasing these components for our holiday production runs,
resulting in margin declines as these components were sold, primarily in the
fourth quarter of 2007.   Gross margins for the aviation, marine,
and outdoor/fitness segments are more stable.  Our long-term gross
margin targets are 65%, 55% and 55%, respectively, for these
segments.

Our
existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products
in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from
different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit us
to use these lower cost components.  We believe that because of our
practice of performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products
in-house, our Shijr, Jhongli, and Lin-Kou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our
Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants have experienced
relatively low costs of manufacturing.  In general, products
manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.  Our
manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe
and Salem.

Sales price variability has had and can
be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.  In the past,
prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due
to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price
points.  The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor/fitness,
and marine products have increased due to product mix and the introduction of
more advanced products sold at higher prices.  The effect of the sales
price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could
have a significant impact on our gross profit.

Advertising
Expense

Our advertising expenses consist of
costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail
partners.  As revenues grew in 2005-2008, advertising expense also
increased.  In 2009, we reduced our advertising expense as revenues
declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology.  The
reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share.  We
expect advertising costs to increase in 2010 as revenues grow.


Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative
expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries
      for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries
      and related costs for executives and administrative
    personnel;

·

marketing,
      and other brand building costs;

·

accounting
      and legal costs;

·

information
      systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel
      and related costs; and

·

occupancy
      and other overhead costs.

Due to the economic pressure on our
consumer-oriented business, we decreased selling, general and administrative
expenses in 2009.  As revenues grew in 2005-2008, selling, general and
administrative expenses also increased.  We expect selling, general
and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to increase in 2010 as revenues
grow.

Research
and Development

The majority of our research and
development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high
technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype
development.    Approximately 85% of the research and
development of our products is performed in North America.   The
remainder of our research and development activities is performed by our Taiwan
engineering group, which has increased in size in recent years.

We are committed to increasing the
level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for
expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as
new markets for GPS-enabled devices.  We continue to grow our research
and development budget in absolute terms.

Customers

Best Buy accounted for 13.4% of our net
sales in the year ended December 26, 2009.  Our top ten customers have
contributed between 27% and 43% of net sales since 2005.  We have
experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 49
and 75 days since 2005.  We have experienced an increase in the level
of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix, longer
payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions.  We expect to reduce the
level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms
with our customers.


Income
Taxes

We have experienced a relatively low
effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by
entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.   In
particular,  the profit entitlement afforded our parent company based
on its intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along
with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain
high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax
rate.  As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was
approximately 12.9% during 2009.  This is a decrease from 19.9% during
2008 due to a more favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions
in which the Company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which
the statute of limitations has expired.  We have taken advantage of
the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to
benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through
2013.   We plan on applying for additional incentives for years
beyond 2013 based on capital investments we expect to make in the
future.  However, there can be no assurance that such tax incentives
will be available indefinitely or that we will receive the incentives for which
we apply.

Management believes that
due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2010, there may be slightly
less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions. 
Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be slightly
higher than fiscal 2009.  The actual effective tax rate will be dependent
upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments
made during fiscal 2010, and the composition of our
earnings.

Net sales
decreased 15.7% in 2009 when compared to the year-ago period. The decrease
occurred across all segments, except outdoor/fitness, with the greatest
decreases in the automotive/mobile and aviation segments. Automotive/mobile
revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 72.6%
in 2008 to 69.7% in 2009.

Total
unit sales decreased 2% to 16.6 million in 2009 from 16.9 million in 2008. The
lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all
segments, excluding outdoor/fitness, with the greatest percentage declines
occurring in aviation and marine. The lower volumes were driven primarily by the
macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail
partners.

Automotive/mobile
segment revenue declined 19.1% in 2009 as the average selling price declined 18%
and volumes declined 2%.  Average selling price declines continue to be
attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotive/mobile
products compete.  The aviation and marine segments declined 24.0% and
13.1%, respectively in 2009, as both industries experienced significant
slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic
conditions.  Outdoor/fitness segment revenue increased 9.6% due to new
product introductions, including the Dakota™ series, the Forerunner® 405CX, the
Forerunner® 310XT and Edge® 500, and increasing global penetration of the
fitness category.  All segments showed improving trends in the second
half of 2009 as the macroeconomic conditions improved.

The
Company anticipates revenue growth between 0-5% in 2010 driven by mobile product
initiatives and growth in the outdoor/fitness, aviation and marine
segments.  In general, management believes that continuous innovation
and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue
growth.

The decrease in gross profit dollars
was primarily attributable to the automotive/mobile and aviation segments where
the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross
margins earned.  Gross profit margin percentage for the Company
overall increased 450 basis points as margins expanded in all
segments.


The
automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of 350 basis
points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory
reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price
declines.  Management believes that gross margins for this segment
will decline in 2010 due to ongoing price declines outpacing product cost
declines.  Outdoor/fitness gross margin increased principally due to a
newer suite of higher margin products.  Gross profit margin percentage
for marine and aviation increased compared to 2008 due to increased average
selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material
cost reductions.

Advertising expense decreased both as a
percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to 2008.  As
a percent of sales, advertising expenses declined to 5.3% in 2009 compared to
6.0% in 2008.  The decrease was a result of actions taken by the
company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across
our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising
which is tied to net sales levels.  Management expects to maintain
advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2010.

Selling, general and administrative
expense decreased 4.7% in 2009 while it increased as a percentage of sales
compared to 2008 as costs throughout the Company were reduced but not as rapidly
as the revenue declines.  The decline in costs was primarily related
to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in 2008 as
a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support
and information technology as our installed base of users continues to
grow.  The increased expense for the outdoor/fitness segment and the
decreased expense for the automotive/mobile segment were driven by the
allocation of costs based on revenues.  As outdoor/fitness revenues
have increased as a percentage of revenues, additional selling, general and
administrative expenses are shifted to the segment.  As a percent of
sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 7.9% in 2008
to 9.0% of sales in 2009, as revenues declined.  Management expects to
maintain selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales
constant in 2010.

The increase in research and
development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new
products including the mobile handset initiative, the addition of 230 new
engineering personnel to our staff during the period, and an increase in
engineering program costs in 2009 as a result of our continued emphasis on
product innovation.  Management believes that one of the key strategic
initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation,
development, and introduction of new products.  Management expects
that its research and development expenses will increase approximately 20%
during fiscal 2010 on an absolute dollar basis due to the anticipated
introduction of a strong portfolio of new products including mobile handsets
slated for fiscal 2010.  Management expects to continue to invest in
the research and development of new products and technology in order to maintain
Garmin’s competitive advantage in the markets in which it competes.

Other
income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency
exchange gains and losses.  Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal
2009 relative to fiscal 2008, with the majority of this difference caused by a
large gain on sale of equity securities in 2008.  Interest income for
fiscal 2009 decreased due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher
cash and marketable securities balances.

Foreign
currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the
Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.   The
U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe)
Ltd.  The Euro is the functional currency of all other European
subsidiaries excluding Garmin Danmark and Garmin Sweden.  As these
entities have grown, Euro currency moves generated material gains and
losses.   Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in
Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.  The Canadian
dollar, Danish Krone, Swedish Krona and Australian Dollar are the functional
currency of Dynastream Innovations, Inc., Garmin Danmark, Garmin Sweden, and
Garmin Australasia respectively; due to these entities’ relative size, currency
moves are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

The $6.0
million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar
compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan
Dollar.  During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared
to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of
$5.8 million.  A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar
weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.  The relative weakness of
the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to
the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British
Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue. The remaining net currency gain
of $4.3 million related to other currencies and timing of
transactions.

The $35.3
million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the U.S.
Dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our Tele Atlas
N.V. shares.  During 2008, the Taiwan Dollar weakened 1.6% in
comparison to the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $20.8 million gain.  The
Euro weakened 4.1% and the British Pound Sterling weakened 26.1% relative to the
U.S. Dollar in 2008 which resulted in a $77.3 million loss.  Offsetting
this net loss was a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of
the Euro between the date of purchase of the Tele Atlas N.V. shares in October
2007 to the dates of tender in February, March, and June 2008.  Other
net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of
$0.3 million.


Gain on
sale of equity of securities of $50.9 million in 2008 was primarily generated
from the sale of our equity interest in Tele Atlas N.V. which we acquired in
2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all
outstanding shares, which was subsequently abandoned.

Income
Tax Provision

Our
fiscal 2009 earnings before taxes fell 11.6% when compared to 2008, while our
income tax expense decreased 42.3%.  Income taxes fell $76.8 million,
to $104.7 million, for fiscal year 2009 from $181.5 million for fiscal year
2008, due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before
taxes.  The effective tax rate was 12.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to
19.9% for fiscal 2008.  The decrease in tax rate is due to the
favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the Company
operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of
limitations has expired.

Net
Income

As a
result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 3.9% to $704.0
million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $732.8 million for fiscal year
2008.

The
increase in total net sales for 2008 was primarily driven by outdoor/fitness,
automotive/mobile and aviation product offerings.  Automotive/mobile
revenue remains a significantly larger portion of our revenue mix, decreasing
slightly from 73.6% in 2007 to 72.6% in 2008.  Total unit sales
increased 38% to 16.9 million in 2008 from 12.3 million in
2007.   The higher unit sales volume in 2008 was primarily
attributable to strong sales of automotive products, particularly in North
America, and outdoor/fitness products.   In general, management
believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are
essential for future revenue growth.

Automotive/mobile
segment revenue grew 8.4% in 2008, on the strength of the nuvi

®

series
of personal navigation devices (PNDs), as well as increased consumer awareness
of the capabilities and applications of GPS.   On a percentage
basis, revenues in our outdoor/fitness segment grew faster than any other
segment from the year ago period due to the introduction of the Colorado™
series, the Oregon ™ series, the Forerunner

®

405 and
Edge

®

705 which offer enhanced form factors and cartography.  Our
aviation segment continued to grow on the strength of our G1000 cockpit as an
OEM (original equipment manufacturer) solution.  This growth slowed
significantly in the second half of 2008 as the macroeconomic conditions
influenced purchasing decisions and slowed OEM production
schedules.   Marine revenues were slightly higher than the prior
year due to strong growth in the first quarter of 2008 offset by flat to
declining revenue in the remainder of the year due to macroeconomic conditions
and fuel prices.

The increase in gross profit dollars
was primarily attributable to the outdoor/fitness and aviation segments where
revenue growth and consistent margins contributed.  Gross profit
margin percentage for the Company overall decreased 150 basis points as a result
of the automotive/mobile segment decline of 310 basis points offset to some
extent by strong gross margins in our other three segments.   The
automotive/mobile segment is by nature a lower-margin business and the Company
has begun to see the impacts expected on gross margin due to falling prices and
a product mix shift toward lower end PNDs.  Outdoor/fitness gross
margin has increased due to a newer suite of products.  A product mix
favoring the high margin G1000 in the aviation segment resulted in favorable
gross margins for the aviation segment in 2008.   Marine gross
margin remained relatively stable and within historic ranges.

The increase in selling, general and
administrative expense was driven primarily by costs associated with the
European distributors acquired in 2007 and 2008, increased staffing to support
our growth and bad debt expense.   Selling, general and
administrative expenses excluding advertising increased by $87.7 million in 2008
due to the acquired European distributors, information technology, call center
operations, and other administrative areas to support the growth of our
businesses, as well as bad debt expense due to the bankruptcy of Circuit
City.

The increase in research and
development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new
products, the addition of 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the
period, and an increase in engineering program costs in 2008 as a result of our
continued emphasis on product innovation.

Other
income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency
exchange gains and losses.  Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal
2008 relative to fiscal 2007, with the majority of this difference caused by a
large foreign currency loss in 2008.  Interest income for fiscal 2008
decreased due to lower interest rates and a decline in our cash and marketable
securities balances during the year.

Foreign
currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the
Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.   The
U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin (Europe)
Ltd.  The Euro is the functional currency of all other European
subsidiaries excluding Garmin Danmark and Garmin Sweden.  As these
entities have grown, Euro currency moves generated material gains and
losses.   Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in
Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.  The Canadian
dollar, Danish Krone, Swedish Krona and Australian Dollar are the functional
currency of Dynastream Innovations, Inc., Garmin Danmark, Garmin Sweden, and
Garmin Australasia respectively; due to these entities’ relative size, currency
moves are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

The $35.3
million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the U.S.
Dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our Tele Atlas
N.V. shares.  During 2008, the Taiwan Dollar weakened 1.6% in
comparison to the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $20.8 million gain.  The
Euro weakened 4.1% and the British Pound Sterling weakened 26.1% relative to the
U.S. Dollar in 2008 which resulted in a $77.3 million loss.  Offsetting
this net loss was a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of
the Euro between the date of purchase of the Tele Atlas N.V. shares in October
2007 to the dates of tender in February, March, and June 2008.  Other
net currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of
$0.3 million.

The
majority of the $23.0 million currency gain in fiscal 2007 was due to the
weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound
Sterling.   During fiscal 2007, the Taiwan Dollar strengthened
relative to the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $2.5 million
loss.   The British Pound Sterling and the Euro strengthened 2%
and 11.4% respectively, relative to the U.S. Dollar during fiscal 2007, which
resulted in a $25.6 million gain.   Other net currency gains and
the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of $0.1
million.


Other
income of $50.9 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our
equity interest in Tele Atlas N.V. which we acquired in 2007 in connection with
our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares, which was
subsequently abandoned.

Income
Tax Provision

Our
earnings before taxes fell 6.5% when compared to 2007, yet our income tax
expense increased by $58.2 million, to $181.5 million, for fiscal year 2008 from
$123.3 million for fiscal year 2007, due to a higher effective tax
rate.  The effective tax rate was 19.9% for fiscal 2008 compared to
12.6% for fiscal 2007.  The increase in tax rate is due to a change in
tax law related to the repatriation of earnings from our Taiwan subsidiary and
the unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the
Company operates.

Net
Income

As a
result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 14% to $732.8
million for fiscal year 2008 compared to $855.0 million for fiscal year
2007.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

Net cash
generated by operations was $1,094.5 million, $862.2 million, and $682.1 million
for fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  In general, cash
from operations has been derived from strong income levels and improved working
capital management.  The increase in 2009 was principally related
to   reductions in inventories and increases in deferred revenues
and accrued expenses offset by the cash flow effects of increased accounts
receivable due to the seasonally strong fourth quarter.  Deferred
revenues relate to the nüMaps Lifetime™ offering as discussed in critical
accounting policies.  Accrued expenses increased primarily due to the
timing of license fee payments.  With regard to inventory, we operate
with a customer-oriented approach and seek to maintain sufficient inventory to
meet customer demand.  Because we desire to respond quickly to our
customers and minimize order fulfillment time, our inventory levels are
generally substantial enough to meet most demand.  We also attempt to
carry sufficient inventory levels of key components so that potential supplier
shortages have as minimal an impact as possible on our ability to deliver our
finished products.  We do not plan to further reduce inventory levels
in 2010.

Capital expenditures in 2009 totaled
$49.2 million, a decrease of $70.4 million from fiscal 2008.  This
amount in 2009 is related to business operations and maintenance
activities.  This amount in 2008 reflects the build-out of additional
manufacturing lines in Lin-Kou, Taiwan, completion of our expanded North
American distribution facility and maintenance activities.  Capital
expenditures in 2007 totaled $156.8 million.   This amount in
2007 reflects the purchase and build-out of an additional manufacturing facility
in Lin-Kou, Taiwan, continued expansion of research and development facilities
in our Taiwan facilities, as well as ordinary capital expenditures for fiscal
2007.

We have budgeted approximately $50
million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 to include normal ongoing
capital expenditures and maintenance activities.

In addition to capital expenditures,
2009 cash flow used in investing activities related to the net investment in
fixed income securities of our on-hand cash balances of $491.0 million and the
purchase of intangible assets for $7.6 million.  Garmin’s average
return on its investment during 2009 was approximately 1.7%.  This is
a decrease from returns in prior years due to lower interest rates available in
the market.  In addition to capital expenditures, 2008 cash flow used
in investing related to the purchase of European distributors for a total of
$60.1 million, the net sale of $130.7 million of fixed income securities
associated with the investment of our on-hand cash balances and the purchase of
$7.0 million of intangible assets.  The net sale of fixed income
securities was primarily related to $239.3 million of cash generated from the
tender of our shares of Tele Atlas N.V.  Garmin’s average return on
its investments during fiscal 2008 was approximately
3.4%.    In addition to capital expenditures, 2007 cash flow
used in investing related to the purchase of Digital Cyclone, Inc., Garmin
France SAS, Garmin Deutschland GmbH, Garmin Iberia S.A., Garmin Italia S.p.A.,
and the assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc. for a total of $128.8 million,
the net sale of $112.8 million of fixed income securities associated with the
investment of our on-hand cash balances and the purchase of $2.9 million of
intangible assets.  The $112.8 million net sale of fixed income
securities includes the purchase of $188.2 million of Tele Atlas N.V.
outstanding shares in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer
for all outstanding shares which was subsequently abandoned.  Garmin’s
average return on its investments during fiscal 2007 was approximately
4.3%.  It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent
with Garmin’s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of
Directors.  The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve
capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within
the constraint of low credit risk.


Net cash
used by financing activities during 2009 was $161.2 million resulting from the
use of $149.8 million for the payment of a dividend and $20.3 million for the
purchase of stock offset by $8.9 million from the issuance of common shares
related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights
and the related tax benefit.  During 2009, Garmin repurchased 707,600
of its common shares under the $300 million stock repurchase program that was
approved by the Board of Directors on October 22, 2008 and expired on December
31, 2009.  Refer to “Item 5.  Market for the Company’s
Common Shares, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity
Securities” for additional discussion regarding the 2008 share repurchase
programs.

Net cash
used by financing activities during 2008 was $808.1 million resulting from the
use of $671.8 million for the stock repurchases and $150.3 million for the
payment of a dividend offset by $14.0 million from the issuance of common shares
related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights
and the related tax benefit.  The $671.8 million of share repurchases
represented 17.1 million common shares.  Cash flow related to
financing activities resulted in a net use of cash in 2007 of $136.1
million.   During 2007, Garmin repurchased 57,235 of its common
shares under the 3,000,000-share stock repurchase program that was approved by
the Board of Directors on August 3, 2006 and expired on December 31,
2007.   Sources and uses in financing activities during 2007
related primarily to a use for the payment of a dividend ($162.5 million) and
the purchase of stock ($7.8 million), and a source of cash from the issuance of
common shares related to the exercise of employee stock options and stock
appreciation rights the related tax benefit, and the employee stock purchase
plan ($34.4 million).

Cash
dividends paid to shareholders were $149.8 million, $150.3 million, and $162.5
million during fiscal years 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

We currently use cash flow from
operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital
requirements and to repurchase shares.  We expect that future cash
requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital,
repurchase of shares, payment of dividends declared, and the funding of
strategic acquisitions.

We
believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be
sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other
cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2010.

Operating
leases describes lease obligations associated with Garmin facilities located in
the U.S., Taiwan, Europe, and Canada.   Purchase obligations are
the aggregate of those purchase orders that were outstanding on December 26,
2009; these obligations are created and then paid off within 3 months during the
normal course of our manufacturing business.

We may be
required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax
benefits.  However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future
cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make
reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the
respective taxing authorities.  Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits
of $255.7 million as of December 26, 2009, have been excluded from the
contractual obligations table above.  For further information related
to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, “Income Taxes”, to the consolidated
financial statements included in this Report.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements.

Item
7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk primarily in
connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw
materials.  Product pricing and raw materials costs are both
significantly influenced by semiconductor market
conditions.  Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have
been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of
improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials
costs.

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has
had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.  If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs
through price increases.  Our inability or failure to do so could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate
Risk

The
operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure
to movements in currency exchange rates.  We have experienced
significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and
weakening of the U.S. dollar.  The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our
results of operations.

The currencies that create a majority
of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British
Pound Sterling.  Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Shijr, Taiwan,
uses the local currency as the functional currency.  The Company
translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and
expense accounts at average rates during the year.  In order to
minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we
have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in
marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.  In 2009, the
Taiwan Dollar strengthened 2.3% relative to the U.S. Dollar which resulted in a
net foreign currency loss of $16.1 million at Garmin Corporation during
2009.


All
European subsidiaries excluding Garmin (Europe) Ltd., Garmin Danmark and Garmin
Sweden use the Euro as the functional currency

.

The functional
currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the
U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or
Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related
to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  The
Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future
as our European presence grows.  In 2009, the Euro strengthened 2.4%
relative to the U.S. dollar and the British Pound Sterling strengthened 8.3%
relative to the U.S. dollar.   These currency moves resulted in a
foreign currency gain of $5.8 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European
subsidiaries.  The net result of these currency moves combined with
other gains of $4.3 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was
a net loss of $6.0 million for the Company and a cumulative translation
adjustment of $9.3 million at the end of fiscal 2009.

Interest
Rate Risk

We have
no outstanding long-term debt as of December 26, 2009.   We,
therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are
exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable
securities.   As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and
losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.  A
hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on
such unrealized gains or losses.  At December 26, 2009, cumulative
unrealized losses on those securities were $21.8 million.

Report
of Ernst & Young LLP

Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
Ltd.

We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and
Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 26,
2009.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).  These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our
opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and
Subsidiaries at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 and the consolidated
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 26, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We also
have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2009, based on criteria established in the Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2010 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December

1.
Description of the Business

Garmin
Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) manufacture, market, and
distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related
products.   Garmin Corporation (GC), wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd.,
is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s
products to Garmin International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC,
and Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd.,
and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the
Company’s products in Asia and the Far East.  GII is primarily
responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in many
international markets and in the United States as well as research and new
product development. GII also manufactures certain products for the Company’s
aviation segment.   GEL is responsible for sales and marketing of
the Company’s products, principally within the European
market.   In addition, the Company acquired ten European
distributors in 2007 and 2008 which distribute Garmin product throughout
Europe.

2.  Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis
of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect
the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.  Prior
year reclassifications have been made between noncurrent deferred tax
liabilities and noncurrent deferred tax assets to reflect the net tax position
in various jurisdictions and between deferred revenue and other accrued expenses
to reflect the 2008 balance. The change was not material.

Fiscal
Year

The
Company has adopted a 52–53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the
calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar
year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including
the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal
year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal
years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year
occurs.

In those
resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week
of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial
results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will
not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and
the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.   Fiscal 2009,
2008, and 2007 included 52 weeks.

Foreign
Currency Translation

Many
Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar
(USD) as their functional currency.  As required by the

Foreign Currency Matters

topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards
Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all
periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of
Garmin Ltd. and GII, and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of
consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses
and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this
translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Cumulative translation adjustments of $9,231 and ($15,306) as of December 26,
2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively, net of related taxes, have been
included in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss) in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.


Transactions
in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the
transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are
translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All
differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange
gains/(losses) of ($6,040), ($35,286), and $22,964 for the years ended December
26, 2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, respectively.  The
loss in fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of the weakening of the USD against
the Taiwan Dollar offset by the weakening of the USD against the Euro and the
British Pound Sterling.  The loss in fiscal 2008 was the result of the
strengthening of the USD offset by a gain associated with the sale and tender of
our Tele Atlas N.V. shares.  The gain in fiscal 2007 was the result of
the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound Sterling relative to the USD
experienced by our European companies.

Earnings
Per Share

Basic
earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the
number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock
options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased
from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s
stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 10.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

For
purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on
hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of
three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those
instruments.

Trade
Accounts Receivable

The
Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and
extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial
condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each
individual customer’s financial condition. The Company carries its trade
accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable
are collected within 60 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its
exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses
or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the
aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due
receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have
been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.


Inventories

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the
weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and
GEL.   Inventories consisted of the following:

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives:

Long-Lived
Assets

As
required by the

Property,
Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived
assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of
a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
asset.  That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset
at the date it is tested for recoverability.  An impairment loss is
measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset
exceeds its fair value.

The

Intangibles – Goodwill and
Other

topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets
with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company did not recognize
any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2009, 2008, or 2007. The
Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure.
For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to
these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  The
accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be
amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment. The
Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite
lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.

Dividends

On July
30, 2009 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be
paid on December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on December 1,
2009.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of
$149,846.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained
earnings.


On June
6, 2008 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be paid
on December 15, 2008 to shareholders of record on December 1,
2008.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of
$150,251.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained
earnings.

On August
1, 2007 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be paid
on September 14, 2007 to shareholders of record on August 15,
2007.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of
$162,531.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained
earnings.

Approximately
$199,549 and $186,383 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from
distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 26, 2009
and December 27, 2008, respectively.

Intangible
Assets

At
December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, the Company had patents, license
agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived
intangible assets recorded at a cost of $173,018 and $152,104,
respectively.  The Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of
net assets acquired (goodwill) was $129,066 at December 26, 2009 and $127,429 at
December 27, 2008.

Identifiable,
finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives
on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.  Accumulated
amortization was $80,428 and $48,579 at December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008
respectively.  Amortization expense was $37,444, $30,874, and $26,942,
for the years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007,
respectively.  In the next five years, the amortization expense is
estimated to be $41,025, $24,945, $13,933, $4,572, and $2,539,
respectively.

Marketable
Securities

Management
determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time
of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet
date.

All of
the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at
December 26, 2009. See Note 3.  Available-for-sale securities are
stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported
in other comprehensive gain/(loss).  At December 26, 2009 and December
27, 2008, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of ($22,613) and ($22,345),
respectively, were reported accumulated in other comprehensive gain/(loss), net
of related taxes.

The
amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted
for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the
case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.
Such amortization is included in interest income from investments. Realized
gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are
included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific
identification method.

Income
Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with
the FASB ASC topic

Income
Taxes

. The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as
measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse. Income taxes of $171,097 and $153,170 at
December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008, respectively, have not been accrued by
the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its subsidiaries because
such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries
indefinitely.


The Company adopted the applicable
guidance included in the FASB ASC topic

Income Taxes

related to
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning
of fiscal year 2007.   The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits
as of December 26, 2009 was $255.7 million including interest of $20.1
million.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
unrecognized tax benefits for years ending December 26, 2009 and December 27,
2008 is as follows (in $millions):

The
December 26, 2009 balance of $255.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits, if
recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized
tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of
deductibility.

Accounting
guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current
liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year
of the balance sheet date.  The entire $255.7 million and $214.4 million
are required to be classified as non-current at December 26, 2009 and December
27, 2008, respectively.

Interest
expense and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are
reflected in income tax expense.  At December 26, 2009 and December 27,
2008, the Company had accrued approximately $20.1 and $11.1 million respectively
for interest.   Interest expense included in income tax expense
for the years ending December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 are $9.0 million
and $6.4 million, respectively.  The Company had no amounts accrued
for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized,
would not warrant the imposition of penalties.

The
Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various
state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject
to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years
prior to 2006.  The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax
examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2004.  The Company is no
longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years
prior to 2008.

The Company believes that it is
reasonably possible that approximately $30 million of its reserves for certain
unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result
of the expiration of statute of limitations.  This potential decrease
in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate
within the next 12 months.

Use
of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.


Concentration
of Credit Risk

The
Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s
pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require
security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided
for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and typically have been
within management’s expectations.   Credit risk has become more
significant in fiscal 2009 due to the macro economic conditions but the Company
is managing credit terms and balances accordingly.  Certain customers
are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry
practice.   Most of these extended terms can be classified as
either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product
releases by the Company.

Revenue
Recognition

Garmin
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery
has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is
probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met
once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the
customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware
products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the
functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry
specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products
and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality
of the hardware.  The Company generally does not offer specified or
unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software
sales.

Garmin
introduced nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that,
subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the
latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life
of their PND.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of
nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized
ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated three-year life of
the products.

For multi-element arrangements that
include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the
tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate
to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to
all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,
the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling
price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows:
(i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”),
(ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and (iii) best
estimate of the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the
Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by
the Company for that deliverable.

In 2009,
Garmin introduced the nüvi 1690, a premium PND with a built‐in wireless module
that lets customers access Garmin’s nüLink!™ service, which provides direct
links to certain online information.  The Company has identified two
deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690. The
first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of
the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is
the nüLink service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two
deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.
  Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related
essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  Amounts allocated to the
nüLink services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the
24-month life of the service.

The Company records reductions to
revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical
experience.


Shipping
and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.

Product
Warranty

The
Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty
period is generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception of
certain aviation products for which the warranty period is two years from the
date of installation and certain marine products for which the warranty period
is three years from the date of shipment

.

Sales
Programs

The
Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and
distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and
growth. Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end
users on certain products. Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers
and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a
monthly basis.   In addition, the Company provides dealers and
distributors with product discounts termed “price protection” to assist these
customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new
product releases. Each price protection discount is tied to a specific product
and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the price protected
product or a special price protection discount may be agreed to on an individual
customer basis.  These rebates, incentives, and price protections are
recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income in the period the Company has sold the product.

Advertising
Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to
approximately $155,521, $208,177, and $206,948 for the years ended December 26,
2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, respectively.

Research
and Development

A
majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United
States. Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted
to approximately $238,378, $206,109, and $159,406 for the years ended December
26, 2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007,
respectively.

Customer
Service and Technical Support

Customer
service and technical support costs are included on the selling, general and
administrative expense line on our statements of operations. Customer service
and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order
processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites,
e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support
assistance to customers. The technical support is provided within one year after
the associated revenue is recognized. The related cost of providing this free
support is not material.


Software
Development Costs

The FASB
ASC topic entitled

Software

requires companies
to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized
until the product is available for general release to customers. Our capitalized
software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working
model to release is typically short. As required by the

Research and Development

topic of the FASB ASC, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after
the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period
they are incurred and included in research and development costs on our
statement of operations.

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

The
Company currently sponsors three stock based employee compensation plans. The
FASB ASC topic entitled

Compensation – Stock
Compensation

requires the measurement and recognition of compensation
expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors
including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair
values. See Note 9.

Accounting
guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment
awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the
portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as
stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service period in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As
stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated
statement of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have
been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures
to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent
periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were
estimated based on historical experience and management’s
estimates.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May
2008, the FASB issued EITF 07‐1, Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements which
was subsequently codified. EITF Issue 07‐1 requires entities entering into
collaborative arrangements in which two or more parties actively participate in
a joint operating activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that
depend on the commercial success of the joint operating activity to make
specific disclosures regarding that arrangement. Garmin announced a strategic
alliance with ASUSTeK Computer Inc. on February 4, 2009 to leverage the
companies’ navigation and mobile telephony expertise to design, manufacture and
distribute co‐branded location‐centric mobile phones. The mobile phone product
line is known as the Garmin‐Asus nüvifone series. The Company has adopted EITF
Issue 07‐1 and the strategic alliance did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial condition or operating results in 2009.

In
January 2009, the FASB released Proposed Staff Position SFAS 107-b and
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 28-a, “Interim Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (SFAS 107-b and APB 28-a), both of which
were subsequently codified.  This proposal amends FASB Statement No.
107, “Disclosures about Fair Values of Financial Instruments,” to require
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial
statements as well as in annual financial statements.  The proposal
also amends APB Opinion No. 28, “Interim Financial Reporting,” to require those
disclosures in all interim financial statements.  This proposal is
effective for interim periods ending after June 15, 2009, but early adoption is
permitted for interim periods ending after March 15, 2009.  The
Company has adopted SFAS 107-b and APB 28-a and the guidance did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results in
2009.


In April
2009, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 157-4 (“FSP FAS 157-4”), “Determining Fair
Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability has
Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly” and
FSP No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2 (“FSP FAS 115-2”), “Recognition and Presentation
of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments”, both of which were subsequently
codified.  These two FSPs were issued to provide additional guidance
about (1) measuring the fair value of financial instruments when the markets
become inactive and quoted prices may reflect distressed transactions, and (2)
recording impairment charges on investments in debt
instruments.  Additionally, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 107-1 and APB
28-1 (“FSP FAS 107-1”), “Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments,” to require disclosures of fair value of certain financial
instruments in interim financial statements.   These FSPs are
effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual reporting
periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The Company has adopted the FSPs and
the guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition
or operating results in 2009.

In May
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, “Subsequent Events” (“SFAS 165”) which was
subsequently codified.  SFAS 165 establishes general standards of
accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date
but before financial statements are issued or are available to be
issued.   SFAS 165 is effective for interim or annual financial
periods ending after June 15, 2009.  The Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 165 for the quarter ended June 27, 2009.  The adoption of this
standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial
statements.

In June
2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 168, “The FASB Accounting Standards
CodificationTM and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles a
replacement of FASB Statement No. 162” (“SFAS 168”) which was subsequently
codified.  SFAS 168 provides for the FASB Accounting Standards
CodificationTM (the “ASC”) to become the single official source of
authoritative, nongovernmental U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP).  The Codification did not change GAAP but reorganizes the
literature.  SFAS 168 is effective for interim and annual periods
ending after September 15, 2009.  The adoption of this standard did
not have a material effect on our financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-13, Revenue
Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements which was
subsequently codified.  This guidance modifies the fair value requirements
of ASC subtopic 605-25 Revenue Recognition-Multiple Element Arrangements by
allowing the use of the “best estimate of selling price” in addition to Vendor
Specific Objective Evidence (“VSOE”) and third-party evidence (“TPE”) for
determining the selling price of a deliverable. A vendor is now required to use
its best estimate of the selling price when VSOE or TPE of the selling price
cannot be determined. In addition, the residual method of allocating arrangement
consideration is no longer permitted. The amendments included in this update
will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. 
Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has adopted this guidance and it
did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating
results in 2009, as the Company does not have a significant amount of sales that
contain multiple elements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-14, Software
(Topic 985):  Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements
which was subsequently codified.    This guidance modifies the scope
of ASC subtopic 965-605 Software-Revenue Recognition to exclude from its
requirements (a) non-software components of tangible products and
(b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed, or
leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software
components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible
product’s essential functionality.   The amendments included in this
update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or
materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. 
Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has adopted this guidance and it
did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating
results in 2009, as the Company does not have a significant amount of sales that
contain undelivered software components that are not essential to the product’s
functionality.

Marketable Securities

The FASB
ASC topic entitled

Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit
price).  The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure
fair value into the following hierarchy:


Level

Unadjusted
      quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
      liability

Level

Unadjusted
      quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or
      Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar
  assets

Level

Unobservable
      inputs for the asset or liability

The Company endeavors to utilize the
best available information in measuring fair value.  Financial assets
and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For fair value measurements using
significant unobservable inputs, an independent third party provided the
valuation.  The inputs used in the valuations used the following
methodology.  The collateral composition was used to estimate Weighted
Average Life based on historical and projected payment
information.  Cash flows were projected for the issuing trusts, taking
into account underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding, and payout
formulas.  Taking this information into account, assumptions were made
as to the yields likely to be required, based upon then current market
conditions for comparable or similar term Asset Based Securities as well as
other fixed income securities.

Assets
and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are
summarized below:

or longer.  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the
period, the accounting guidance requires a reconciliation of the beginning and
ending balances, separately for each major category of assets.  The
reconciliation is as follows:

The cost
of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

The
unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in 2008 and 2009 were caused
primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit
spreads.  The Company’s investment policy requires investments to be
rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of
principal loss.  Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be
temporary in nature.  Fair values were determined for each individual
security in the investment portfolio.  When evaluating the investments
for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the
length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold
the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated
recovery in market value.  During 2008 and 2009, the Company did not
record any material impairment charges on its outstanding
securities.

The
amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 26,
2009, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ
from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the
right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

United Kingdom value-added tax requirements.  The total amount of
restricted cash balances were $2,047 and $1,941 at December 26, 2009 and
December 27, 2008, respectively.

In the
normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to
various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other
risks.  It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the
Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal
matters, or if not, what the impact might be.   However, the Company’s
management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations,
financial position or cash flows.

5. 
Employee Benefit Plans

GII
sponsors a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which its
employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to
Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which GII contributes a
specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain
limits as defined in the Plan.  Additionally, GEL has a defined
contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their
annual compensation. Both GII and GEL contribute an amount determined annually
at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 26,
2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, expense related to these plans
of $16,399, $14,927, and $11,412, was charged to operations.


Certain
of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit
pension plans.  Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider
final pensionable salaries.  Neither obligations nor contributions for the
years ended December 26, 2009, December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, were
significant.

December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, respectively. The Taiwan tax holiday
benefits included in the table above reflect $0.09, $0.12, and $0.20 per
weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 26, 2009,
December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007, respectively.  The Company
currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through 2013, at
which time these tax benefits expire.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As
required by the

Financial
Instruments

topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required
information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it
is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial
instruments are held or issued for trading purposes. The carrying amounts and
fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

For
certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable,
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate
fair value due to their short maturities.


8. 
Segment Information

The Company operates within its
targeted markets through four reportable segments, those being related to
products sold into the marine, automotive/mobile, outdoor/fitness, and aviation
markets. For external reporting purposes, we aggregate operating segments which
have similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or
classes of customers and distribution methods into reportable segments. 
All of the Company’s reportable segments offer products through the Company’s
network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEM’s. 
However, the nature of products and types of customers for the four reportable
segments vary significantly. The Company’s marine, automotive/mobile, and
outdoor/fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS)
receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets. These products are
produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan.  The Company’s
aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules
and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation
dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The
Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating
Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources
based on income before income taxes of each segment.

Income before income
taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including certain allocated
general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency
adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses. The accounting policies
of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or
transfers.

The
identifiable assets associated with each reportable segment reviewed by the CODM
include accounts receivable and inventories. The Company does not report
property and equipment, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, or
capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

Revenues,
interest income and interest expense, income before income taxes, and
identifiable assets for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented
below:



Net
sales, long-lived assets (property and equipment), and net assets by geographic
area are as follows as of and for the years ended December 26, 2009, December

Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

The
various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below:

Equity Incentive Plan

In June
2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”)
providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance
shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to
10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and
stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years or as
otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and
generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised. 
 During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company granted 0, 1,454,050 and 2,838,200
stock appreciation rights, respectively.  During 2009, 2008 and 2007,
470,950, 1,043,800, and 0 restricted stock units were granted under the 2005
Plan.  In 2009, 2008, and 2007, 0, 30,000 and 0 performance shares were
also granted under the 2005 Plan.

Equity Incentive Plan

In
October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000
Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance
shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to
7,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and stock
appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally
expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.   During
2009, 2008, and 2007, the Company granted 0, 0, and 20,000 stock appreciation
rights.


Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

Also in
October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee
directors (the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up to 100,000
common shares. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over
a three-year period. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, options to purchase 34,648,
15,696, and 5,562 shares, respectively, were granted under this plan. In 2009,
the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making the
total shares authorized under the plan 250,000.

Stock-Based
Compensation Activity

A summary
of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under
the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2000
Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan for the years ended December 26, 2009,
December 27, 2008, and December 29, 2007 is provided below:


The
weighted-average remaining contract life for options outstanding and exercisable
at December 26, 2009 is 6.28 and 5.49 years, respectively.

The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2009,
2008, and 2007:

The
Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the
fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly
subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because
the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.  The
weighted-average fair value for awards granted during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was
$29.20, $37.96 and $84.61, respectively.

The total
fair value of awards vested during 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $41,527, $35,384,
and $17,840, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values of options
outstanding and exercisable at December 26, 2009 were $36.3 million and $34.6
million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during
the year ended December 26, 2009 was $3.7 million. Aggregate intrinsic value
represents the positive difference between the Company’s closing stock price on
the last trading day of the fiscal period, which was $30.98 on December 26,
2009, and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised. As
of December 26, 2009, there was $111.5 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to
employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is expected to be
recognized over a period of five years.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The
shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up to
2,000,000 shares of  common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares
will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair
market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market
value on the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee
stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
During 2009, 2008, and 2007, 209,416, 362,902, and 120,230 shares, respectively
were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $3,874, $8,782, and
$5,730, respectively.   At December 26, 2009, approximately 424,637
shares were available for future issuance.

computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was
antidilutive.

11. 
Share Repurchase Program

The Board
of Directors approved a share repurchase program on October 22, 2008,
authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its common shares as
market and business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase
authorization expired on December 31, 2009.   From inception to
expiration, $60 million of common shares were repurchased and retired under this
plan.

The Board
of Directors approved a share repurchase program on June 6, 2008, authorizing
the Company to purchase up to 10,000,000 of its common shares as market and
business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase authorization
expired on December 31, 2009.   During fiscal 2008, 10,000,000 shares
were repurchased and retired under this plan.

The Board
of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 4, 2008,
authorizing the Company to purchase up to 5,000,000 of its common shares as
market and business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase
authorization expired on December 31, 2009.   During fiscal 2008,
5,000,000 shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.

The Board
of Directors approved a share repurchase program on August 3, 2006, authorizing
the Company to purchase up to 3,000,000 of its common shares as market and
business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase authorization
expired on December 31, 2007.   From inception to expiration,
1,212,535 shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.


12. 
Shareholder Rights Plan

On
October 24, 2001, Garmin’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan
(the “Rights Plan”). Pursuant to the Rights Plan, the Board declared a dividend
of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding common share of Garmin
to shareholders of record as of November 1, 2001. The rights trade together with
Garmin’s common shares. The rights generally will become exercisable if a person
or group acquires or announces an intention to acquire 15% or more of Garmin’s
outstanding common shares. Each right (other than those held by the new 15%
shareholder) will then be exercisable to purchase preferred shares of Garmin (or
in certain instances other securities of Garmin) having at that time a market
value equal to two times the then current exercise price. Garmin’s Board of
Directors may redeem the rights at $0.001 per right at any time before the
rights become exercisable. The rights expire on October 31, 2011.

13. 
Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited)

The above
quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these
interim periods presented have been included.  These results are not
necessarily indicative of future quarterly results.

14.
Warranty Reserves

The
Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging
from one to two years.   The Company’s estimate of costs to service
its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectation of
future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. 
 The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the
aggregate warranty reserve:


15.
Subsequent Events

On February 12, 2010, the Board of
Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to
repurchase up to $300 million of the common shares of Garmin Ltd. The
repurchases may be made from time to time as market and business conditions
warrant on the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the
SEC’s Rule 10b-18. The timing and amounts of any repurchases will be determined
by the Company’s management depending on market conditions and other factors
including price, regulatory requirements and capital availability. The program
does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may be
suspended or discontinued at any time. The share repurchase authorization
expires on December 31, 2010.

The Company evaluated subsequent events
through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 24,
2010.

9A. Controls and Procedures

(a)
Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period
covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and
procedures are effective.

(b)
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management
of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and
32.2.

Management
of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 26, 2009. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated
Framework”.

Based on
such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
26, 2009.

Ernst
& Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited
the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on
management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 26, 2009, as stated in their report which is included
herein. That attestation report appears below.

The Board

Garmin
Ltd.

We have
audited Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
26, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd.’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based
on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our
opinion, Garmin Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2009, based on the COSO
criteria.

We have
also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin Ltd. and
Subsidiaries

as of
December 26, 2009 and December 27, 2008 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 26, 2009 and our report dated February 24, 2010
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
