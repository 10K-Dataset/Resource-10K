CAUTIONARY STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO
FORWARD-LOOKING COMMENTS

The discussions set
forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain statements concerning potential future events. Such forward-looking statements
are based upon assumptions by the Company's management, as of the date of this Annual Report, including assumptions about risks
and uncertainties faced by the Company. In addition, management may make forward-looking statements orally or in other writings,
including, but not limited to, in press releases, in the annual report to shareholders and in the Company’s other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs
as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. Forward-looking
statements include any discussion of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.” Readers are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their date. If any of management's assumptions
prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, the Company's actual results could materially differ from those anticipated
by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including,
but not limited to, those factors identified under Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Readers are strongly encouraged to consider
those factors when evaluating any forward-looking statements concerning the Company. The Company does not undertake to update
any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report to reflect future events or developments.

Part I

Item 1.

Business

This discussion of
the business of Garmin Ltd. ("Garmin" or the "Company") should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified
by reference to, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item
7 herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference
in partial response to this Item 1. Beginning in 2011, for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating
segments – Auto/Mobile, Aviation, Marine, Outdoor and Fitness. Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated
by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually. Prior
to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of
those products, their production processes, the types of customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic
conditions. Management re-evaluated the combination of these operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics
of these segments they should now be reported as two distinct reportable segments. The segment and geographic information included
in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” under Note 8 is incorporated herein by reference in partial
response to this Item 1 and has been restated to reflect the five operating segments as discussed above for all periods presented.

Garmin was incorporated
in Switzerland on February 9, 2010 as successor to Garmin Ltd., a Cayman Islands company (“Garmin Cayman”). Garmin
Cayman was incorporated on July 24, 2000 as a holding company for Garmin Corporation, a Taiwan corporation, in order to facilitate
a public offering of Garmin Cayman shares in the United States. On June 27, 2010, Garmin became the ultimate parent holding company
of the Garmin group of companies pursuant to a share exchange transaction effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation
of the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the “Redomestication”).
Pursuant to the Redomestication, all issued and outstanding Garmin Cayman common shares were transferred to Garmin and each common
share, par value U.S. $0.005 per share, of Garmin Cayman was exchanged for one registered share, par value 10 Swiss francs (“CHF”)
per share, of Garmin. Garmin owns, directly or indirectly, all of the operating companies in the Garmin group.

Company Overview

Garmin is a leading,
worldwide provider of navigation, communication and information devices and applications, most of which are enabled by Global
Positioning System (“GPS”) technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse family of hand-held,
portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile,
outdoor, fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.

Overview of the Global Positioning System

The Global Positioning
System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite
technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring
stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment
program to ensure continuous global system coverage. Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.

Prior to May 2000,
the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability
(‘‘SA’’) for national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a radius of 100
meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December
2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA again and is committed to preventing hostile
use of GPS through regional denial of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS receiver can calculate
its position to an accuracy of approximately 10 meters or less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The accuracy and utility
of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections
to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’)
comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United
States and most of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute,
terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility
of WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS system had achieved
initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics
equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Japan’s MTSAT-based
Satellite Augmentation System (“MSAS”) achieved initial operating capability for en route, terminal and approach navigation
for aviation on September 27, 2007. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) aviation Safety of Life (“SoL”)
service achieved initial operating capability for en route, terminal, and approach navigation on March 2, 2011.

its principal competitors are Motorola Solutions, Inc., Cobra Electronics Corporation and Midland Radio Corporation.

Research and Development

Garmin’s product
innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering
and manufacturing teams. Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 2,939 people
worldwide as of December 29, 2012. Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely
with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s
development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and
cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success.
Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition
it into manufacturing.

Below is a table of Garmin’s expenditures

Manufacturing and Operations

Garmin believes that
one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its Sijhih, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities,
its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility. Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided
it the following benefits with respect to all products other than a few select marine products (VHF radios and AIS receivers),
and our accessory products, all of which are also manufactured by one or more third parties.

Reduced time-to-market.

Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development
stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins. In this manner,
Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries.

Design and process
optimization.

Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in
order to achieve higher efficiency, improved quality and yields, lower cost and better value for customers. Garmin’s ability
to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and
weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and rugged.

Logistical agility.

Operating our own manufacturing and distribution facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages
and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry. Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component
shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly. Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand
by striving to maintain a safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.
Operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows Garmin to quickly adjust the mix of product production, helping to foster
faster delivery response to the customer.


Garmin’s design,
manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international
quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s automotive operations in Taiwan
and Olathe have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. In addition, Garmin’s
aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.

Garmin International,
Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to
the ISO14001 standard. This certification recognizes that Garmin’s subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize
or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Although most components
essential to Garmin’s

business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components,
including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays (“LCDs”), and certain  application-specific
integrated circuits (“ASICs”) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects
Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including,
but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (“DRAM”), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject
at times to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.

Garmin
and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries
also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition,
Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication and
consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only
one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component
or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have

matured
or manufacturing capacity has increased. Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements
for strategically important components. Nevertheless, if Garmin’s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or
existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, Garmin’s financial condition and operating results
could be materially adversely affected. Garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending
on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those
suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet Garmin’s
requirements.

Seasonality

Our sales are subject
to  seasonal fluctuation. Sales of our consumer products are generally  higher in the fourth quarter,
due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand
during the spring and summer season and the Father’s Day/graduation buying season. Sales of consumer products are also influenced
by the timing of the release of new products. Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced
by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.


Backlog

Our sales are generally
of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment. Therefore, we believe that backlog information
is not material to the understanding of our business. We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability
to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade
secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often
relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography
technology for use in our products from various sources.

As of February 1, 2013,
Garmin’s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 725 patents and 554 trademark registrations.  Garmin was selected as
a constituent of the 2012/2013 Ocean Tomo® 300 Patent Index which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value.
We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate. 
Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in
its proprietary technologies.

There is no assurance
that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part.
It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others
will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized
parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Litigation
may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The telecommunications
industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change. In accordance with
Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be
certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold. Garmin’s products sold in Europe
are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission. A delay in receiving required certifications for new
products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely
affect our business. In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft”
are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations
before they can be used in an aircraft.

Because Garmin Corporation,
one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan
with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations. The Taiwan Foreign Exchange
Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated
to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred
to as the CBC. Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from
exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the
import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks. Aside from trade-related
foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan
foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year. Currency conversions
within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC. The above limits
apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies. The CBC typically
approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business
reasons justifying the currency conversion. A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term
foreign debt with the CBC.


Environmental Matters

Garmin’s operations
are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances
and wastes.  Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Environmental regulation of Garmin’s
products is increasing.  Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition
of our products and their energy efficiency.  Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially
responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products. Compliance with current
environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot
yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

Garmin has implemented
multiple Environmental Management System (“EMS”) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards,
and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility,
Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facility.

Regulatory and “Green
Procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing, particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly
design and manufacture initiatives.  The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established. 
Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.

Employees

As of December 29,
2012, Garmin had 9,777 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,678 were in the United States, 70 were in Canada, 4,469
were in Taiwan, 1,102 were in Europe, and 458 were in other global locations. Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Brazil
and Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan
employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the
only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be
immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or
operating results could be materially adversely affected.


Risks Related to the Company

The demand for personal navigation
devices (PNDs)    has been reduced by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and
factory-installed systems in new autos.

From 2005
to 2008, we experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment. This  has resulted in GPS/navigation
technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed
systems. Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile
devices. The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth in this segment and  reduced margins.
Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles. Increased navigation
penetration on mobile handsets and in new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation
devices and further reduced margins.

Our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately
55% of our revenues, is maturing and expected to further decline in 2013.

We have historically
experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer
electronics in both Europe and North America. This market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies
emerge. This has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower revenues and lower earnings per share.

Economic conditions and uncertainty
could adversely affect our revenue and margins.

Our revenue and margins
depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete. The current
economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result
in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial
difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt
write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.

Gross margins for our products may
fluctuate or erode.

Gross margins on our
automotive/mobile products have declined and could further decline in the future due to price reductions in the competitive market
for navigation solutions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate
from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes. In particular, the average
selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life. To offset such decreases, we intend to rely
primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling
prices. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce
any such new products in the future. To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely
manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.

Changes in our United States federal income tax classification
or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We do not believe
that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’
for United States federal income tax purposes.  We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.  However,
because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets
meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that
may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future. 
If we are a passive foreign investment company in any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could
be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that
shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.  Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in
any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment
company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset
tests mentioned above.


We do not believe
that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States
federal income tax purposes. We do not expect to become a CFC. The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United
States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company. Only United States persons that own
ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s shares qualify as United States shareholders. If the Company were
to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company’s shareholders that qualify as
United States shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain
categories of the Company’s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC. As the Company cannot control
the ownership of the Company’s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company’s stock
buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being
treated as a CFC.

Legislative proposals
have been considered in the United States within the past few years that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations
with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident
in the United States   Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax laws,
tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. We cannot predict the outcome
of any specific legislative proposals.

If we are not successful in the continued
development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We expect that a significant
portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. The market for our products
is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce
new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer
needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete. We must continue to make significant investments in research
and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such
products. However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed,
will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If we are unable to
successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations
would be adversely affected. Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense. We may need to license
new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or
may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products
to new technologies as they emerge. Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict,
and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products. The timely availability
of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. From time to time we have experienced
delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing
delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.


If we are unable to compete effectively
with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer
orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The markets for many
of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly
greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new
or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development,
promotion and sale of their products. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins
and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on independent dealers and
distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because we sell a majority
of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory
levels and support for our products. In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in
their inventories. If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient
levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.

Many of our dealers
and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors. If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable
terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to
retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors. If we are unable to maintain successful relationships
with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.

Our quarterly operating results are
subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our operating results
are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly. If such operating results decline,
the price of our stock would likely decline. As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our selling,
general and administrative and research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales. If revenues decrease
and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically, our revenues
have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year as our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is
traditionally lower in this quarter. Sales of certain of our marine and automotive

products tend to be higher in our second
fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.
Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns
on electronic devices during the holiday season.

In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with
relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Our quarterly financial statements
will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The operation of Garmin’s
subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant
foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

The currencies that
create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Garmin
Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets
and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize
the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s
cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.


Nonetheless, U.S.
GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated
assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary. This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the
subsidiary. This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan
Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies. Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share. Because there is
minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on the Company’s operating
performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.

If we do not correctly anticipate demand
for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could
have costly excess production or inventories.

We have generally been
able to increase production to meet this increasing demand. However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will
be difficult to forecast. We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple
products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the
mass market category. Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:

—

If demand increases beyond what we forecast,
                                                          we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers
                                                          to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might
                                                          not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected
                                                          demand.

—

Rapid increases in production levels
                                                          to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing
                                                          and supply of components and other expenses. These higher costs could
                                                          lower our profit margins. Further, if production is increased rapidly,
                                                          manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins
                                                          and reduce customer satisfaction.

—

If forecasted demand does not develop,
                                                          we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished
                                                          products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs
                                                          of some or all of the excess inventories. Lower than forecasted demand
                                                          could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing
                                                          efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.

We have benefited in the past from
Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our effective tax rate
is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to
our high technology investments in Taiwan. The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results
in the future.

We may experience unique economic and political risks associated
with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Relations between Taiwan
and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions
of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the
market price and the liquidity of our shares. Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products,
except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan has a unique
international political status. The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all
of mainland China. The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government. Although significant economic
and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated
that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by
Taiwan. Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could
negatively affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.


Our intellectual property rights are
important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others.

We rely on a combination
of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect
our proprietary rights. To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications
to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks. However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications
will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks. Moreover, even if approved,
our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of
reasons. Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.

Third parties may claim
that we are infringing their intellectual property rights. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and
financial condition. From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property
rights. Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming. We may seek licenses from such
parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. We might not have sufficient resources
to pay for the licenses. Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently
cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.

We may become subject to significant
product liability costs.

If our aviation products
malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury
or death. Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other
wreckage, personal injury or death. If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by
third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents
could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death. If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant
liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive
damages. We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products. However, there can be no assurance that
such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available
at commercially reasonable rates. In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may
not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins. If we are unable to maintain
sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a
materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on our suppliers, some of
which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able
to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.

We are dependent on
third party suppliers for various components used in our current products. Some of the components that we procure from third party
suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.
The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. Some components
we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs
are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers. Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.

In the past we have
experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components. In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components,
the costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are
unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components
rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.


We depend on third party licensors
for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if
we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.

We license digital
mapping data for use in our products from various sources. There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each
geographical region. The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V. NAVTEQ Corporation is owned
by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V. Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.

Although we do not
foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin
and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we
are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships
with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.

We may pursue strategic acquisitions,
investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully
identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We intend to evaluate
acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products,
or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings,
additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition,
investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to
complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any past or future
acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions),
operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.
Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams.
In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us. We may not successfully integrate internal
controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products
related to acquisitions we have made in previous years or may make in the future. If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions,
our business could be materially harmed.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to
income taxes in Switzerland, the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax
estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from
our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income
tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.


Failure to obtain required certifications of our products
on a timely basis could harm our business.

We have certain products,
especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold. For example,
FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.
To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.
An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce
new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes. Therefore, such inabilities
or delays could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products
will not be decertified. Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Our business may suffer if we are not
able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our future success
depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative
personnel. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. We do not have key man life
insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance. The loss of the services
of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business. Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel
we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult. For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide
shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products,
and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel. If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees,
we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

There is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability
to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.

We are a Swiss company
and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan. As a result, it may be
difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts
of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the
civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original
actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition
of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.

Following the

September
11, 2001

terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days. In addition
to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented
by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR). The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class
B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
(AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft based at 282 airports inside
the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas. The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted
VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

The shutdown of U.S.
airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our
products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting
our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any future shut down
of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial
results.


Many of our products rely on the Global
Positioning System.

The Global Positioning
System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The
satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.
The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals. These satellites and their ground
support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites
were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.
However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.

To repair damaged or
malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable,
there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites
may impair the current utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. GPS satellites
and ground control segments are being modernized. GPS modernization software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access
to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.

GPS is operated by
the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however if the policy were to change, and GPS
were no longer supported by the U. S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Some of our products
also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System
(WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).
Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby
impacting our markets.

Any of the foregoing
factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products
based on competing technologies.

Any reallocation or repurposing of
radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference
could harm our business.

Our Global Positioning
System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global
Positioning System satellites. The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for
radio navigation satellite services. International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications
Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations
that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference. 
Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations
and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or national
reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications
of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products
and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties
caused by war or terrorism.

Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially
any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism,
may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have
an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.


Privacy concerns relating to our technology could damage
our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and applications.

Concerns about our
practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information, user location information or other
privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all
applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to
comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers,
which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.

Regulatory authorities
around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the
interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in
flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If
so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could
have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial
costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.

Security breaches and other disruptions, including as
a result of cyber attacks, could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and
reputation to suffer.

In the ordinary course
of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and
that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities
and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. Despite
our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to
employee error or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed,
publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings,
disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence, which could adversely affect our business.

We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks
related to climate change.

Climate change is receiving increasing
attention worldwide.  Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases,
including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

Various
regulatory and legislative measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in different phases of implementation or discussion.
In the aftermath of its 2009 “endangerment finding” that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to human health and
welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.   At the federal legislative level, Congressional passage
of legislation adopting some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program,
does not appear likely at this time, although it could be adopted at a future date. It is also possible that Congress may pass
alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable
energy and energy efficiency, which could increase the cost of doing business

.

Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations
will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.


Risks Relating
to Our Shares

The volatility of our stock price could
adversely affect investment in our common shares.

The market price of
our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During 2012, the price of our common shares ranged from a
low of $35.84 to a high of $49.33. A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially,
including:

·

announcements and rumors of developments related to our business,
our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete;

·

quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;

·

the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components,
such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products;

·

general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations
in interest rates;

·

announcements of technological innovations;

·

new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

·

product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;

·

developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and
litigation;

·

developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

·

research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage
houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and

·

any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan
or significant markets where we sell our products.

In addition, in recent
years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price
fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. Any such fluctuations in the future
could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over
us.

As of January 9, 2013,
current members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families
and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 40.48% of
our outstanding common shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring
shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring
or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common
shares.

The rights of our shareholders are governed
by Swiss law.

The rights of our shareholders
are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.’s articles of association and organizational regulations. The rights of shareholders
under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law
allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors
without approval of a shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital
and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally,
subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive
rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide
as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions.
Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority
in some other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders
at the general meeting of shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility,
and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.


We may not be able to make distributions
or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.

If
we are unable

to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends,
if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal
withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal
Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the
Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld
in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least
10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). Payment of a capital distribution
in the form of a par value reduction or a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves is not subject to Swiss withholding
tax. However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying
capital contribution reserves, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that
Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders,
in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate
law or other restrictions. There are currently legislative projects pending in Swiss Parliament and the Swiss federal administration
that – depending on their final form – may limit the distribution of qualifying capital contribution reserves. In addition,
over the long term, the amount of par value and qualifying capital contribution reserves available for us to use for par value
reductions or dividends will be limited. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend
out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding
taxes.

Under current Swiss
tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss
withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price.

However, the portion
of the repurchase price that is attributed to qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject
to the Swiss withholding tax. No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not
repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years,
the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period.

We may follow a share
repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the SIX Swiss Exchange
in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares to us and are generally able to receive
a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase
shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes if and to the extent that the repurchase
of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves. No withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent
that qualifying capital contribution reserves are attributable to the share repurchase.

including Garmin International, Inc., alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,557,730 (“the ’730 patent”),
U.S. Patent No. 7,221,287 (“the ’287 patent”), U.S. Patent No. 7,375,649 (“the ’649 patent”),
U.S. Patent No. 7,508,321 (“the ’321 patent”), and U.S. Patent No. 7,702,452 (“the ’452 patent”).
On March 16, 2011, Garmin filed its amended answer asserting that the patents-in-suit are unenforceable because of the inequitable
conduct committed by the inventors before the Patent Office and filed counterclaims asserting that each asserted claim of the ’730,
’287, ’649, ’321, and ’452 patents is not infringed and/or invalid. On July 27, 2011, the court issued
its claim construction order. Trial was held beginning on November 1, 2011. On November 9, 2011, the jury returned a partial verdict
finding the patents-in-suit were valid and finding the ‘730, ‘287, and ‘321 patents were not infringed. The jury
did not return a verdict regarding infringement of the ‘649 and ‘452 patents. On November 23, 2011, the parties filed
motions with the court to resolve the remaining issues left unresolved by the jury’s partial verdict. On February 16, 2012,
the court issued an order entering the jury’s verdict of non-infringement of the ‘730, ‘287, and ‘321 patents,
granting Garmin’s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement of the ‘649 and ‘452 patents, and dismissing
the case. On March 13, 2012 Triangle Software filed a motion to alter or amend judgment and a motion for a new trial. These motions
were denied by the District Court on April 2, 2012. Triangle filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. On February 12, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Triangle’s appeal and affirmed
the District Court’s judgment in favor of Garmin.

Visteon Global Technologies, Inc. and
Visteon Technologies LLC v. Garmin International, Inc.

On
February 10, 2010, Visteon Global Technologies, Inc. and Visteon Technologies LLC filed suit in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, against Garmin International, Inc. alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
No. 5,544,060 (“the ‘060 patent”), U.S. Patent No. 5,654,892 (“the ‘892 patent”), U.S. Patent
No. 5,832, 408 (“the ‘408 patent”), U.S. Patent No 5,987,375 (“the ‘375 patent”) and U.S. Patent
No 6,097,316 (“the ‘316 patent”). On May 17, 2010, Garmin filed its answer asserting that each claim of the ‘060
patent, the ‘892 patent, the ‘408 patent and the ‘375 patent is invalid and/or not infringed. On April 12, 2011,
the special master appointed by the court held a claim construction hearing. On December 12, 2011, the court issued an order adopting
the special master’s report construing the claims of the patents-in-suit. On September 14, 2012, Garmin filed with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office petitions for

ex parte

reexamination of the ‘408 patent and the ‘060 patent as being
anticipated and obvious in view of the prior art. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office subsequently granted Garmin’s requests
for

ex parte

reexaminations and initially rejected all identified claims. On November 30, 2012, Garmin filed motions for
summary judgment of non-infringement and /or invalidity for the ‘892, ‘316, and ‘375 patents. Visteon filed its
own motions for summary judgment of infringement of the ‘408 patent and validity, under section 112, of the ‘375 and
‘060 patents.

On February 4, 2013, the summary judgment
motions were referred to the special master for consideration. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of
this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes
that the claims in this lawsuit are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.


In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving
patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with certainty
whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the
impact might be. However, the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion
and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations,
certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the
consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified
by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including
the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed
above in Item 1A.

As previously noted,
the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events.
Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,”
“believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs. If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based
prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated
by such forward-looking statements. The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including,
but not limited to, those discussed above in Item 1A. Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating
any such forward-looking statement. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal
year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal year 2012 and 2010 contained 52 weeks compared
to 53 weeks for 2011. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar
terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated,
dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide
provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS,
technology. We operate in five business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor, fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.
Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors. However, the
nature of products and types of customers for the five segments can vary significantly. As such, the segments are managed separately.
Our portable GPS receivers and accessories for marine, outdoor, fitness and automotive/mobile segments are sold primarily to retail
outlets. Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation
and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.

Since our first products
were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.

We experience some
foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results. Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to
movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling. The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin
Corporation. The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe. The Euro is the functional currency of most European
subsidiaries. As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material gains and losses. Additionally, Euro-based inter-company
transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses. Other legal entities primarily use the local currency
as the functional currency. Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the
Euro and the British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on
the Company’s financial statements.


Approximately 79% of
sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro. We experienced ($20.0) million,
($12.1) million, and ($88.4) million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. To date,
we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions
in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The presentation of
these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its
estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation. Garmin bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Garmin recognizes revenue
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection
is probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and
risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software
bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting
guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales
of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.  The
Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

Garmin introduced nüMaps
Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables
customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.  The
revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and
recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products. With the acquisition of Navigon AG
in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map and
point of interest information for two years.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products
are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.

For multiple-element
arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered
software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables
based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the
selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and (iii) best estimate of
the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately, on more
than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range. In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered
certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve multiple-element
arrangements that are immaterial.


In 2010, Garmin began
offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price. Similar to nüMaps Lifetime™,
LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.
In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market. The
Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU or premium
traffic service. The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the hardware device
delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service. The Company has allocated revenue
between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related
essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The
revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic service are deferred and
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.

Prior to the third
quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for nüMaps Lifetime
or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic
service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE. The
estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium
traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators
of selling price were not readily available.

During 2011, sales
of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales. Concurrently,
market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced
at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably. Due to these
changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the
third quarter of 2011.

As the sales of nüMaps
Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in mid-2011,
the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of nüMaps Lifetime
or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence of selling
price was not available. Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and the royalty
cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated selling
price. These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception
of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability. As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company changed
its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted average
of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription cost
plus a normal margin.

The impact in 2011
of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue,
gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3 million,
$0.31, and $0.30, respectively.

Garmin records estimated
reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product
discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases),
promotions and other volume-based incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience
and expectation of future conditions. Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results. These
incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued for
on a percentage of sales basis. If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings,
possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.


The
Company records revenue net of sales tax, trade discounts and customer returns.

The reductions
to revenue for expected future product returns are based on Garmin’s historical experience.

Trade Accounts Receivable

We sell our products
to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of each customer’s financial condition. 
Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition. We carry our trade accounts
receivable at net realizable value. Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest. We
monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments. We determine these allowances
by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written
off when our internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful. In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security
against large losses.

Warranties

Garmin’s products
are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years. Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated
costs to provide warranty services. Garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical
experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased
costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.

Inventory

Garmin writes down
its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Investments

Investments are classified
as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’
equity. Investment income is recorded when earned, and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold. Investments are
reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary. If investments
are determined to be impaired, a loss is recognized at the date of determination.

Testing for impairment
of investments requires significant management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination
of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements. The
discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments
are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time. The economic environment
and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment. Investments
are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Income Taxes

Garmin provides deferred
tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for
financial reporting purposes as measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. It is Garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it
believes is more likely than not to be realized. While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible
tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin were to determine that it would
not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would
be charged to income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize
its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase
income in the period such determination is made.

In addition, the calculation
of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities
for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional
taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities would result
in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax
liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.

Stock Based Compensation

Garmin awards stock
options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance shares
each year as part of Garmin’s compensation package for employees. Certain employees within Garmin are eligible for stock
options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is
at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.

Stock-based compensation cost is measured
at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected
life, forfeitures and dividends. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense
could be impacted. Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are primarily generated through
sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers. Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion
above.

Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore, backlog levels are not necessarily
indicative of our future sales results. We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders
within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.
Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer
season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season. Our aviation products do not experience
much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically
the strongest.


Cost
of Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs
are our most significant component of cost of goods sold. In 2012, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 560
basis points driven primarily by the amortization of previously deferred high margin revenues, the third quarter 2011 change in
estimate of per unit revenue and cost deferred as previously discussed and a one-time royalty fee adjustment. See Note 2 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on gross profit deferrals. In 2011, gross margin for our automotive/mobile
segment declined 280 basis points driven primarily by the deferral of high margin revenue associated with bundled products, partially
offset by the change in estimate mentioned above, and decreased selling prices on comparable units, as well as positive impact
to 2010 gross margin from a refinement in the estimated warranty reserve. The substantial increase in product mix toward products
bundled with lifetime maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs than in the prior year, thereby lowering
gross profit by $143 million in 2011 compared to $100 million for
the prior year. In 2010, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling
price declines outpaced raw material price declines. In addition, the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased
significantly as the product mix began to be impacted by a shift toward products bundled with lifetime maps. This was partially
offset by a positive refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.

In 2012, we experienced
a 320 and 260 basis point increase in aviation and fitness gross margins, respectively. Aviation gross margin expansion was driven
primarily by product mix and a OEM program contribution that negatively impacted gross margins in 2011. Fitness gross margin improvement
was due to product mix. In 2011, we experienced a 420 basis point decline in marine gross margin due to a shift in product mix.
Gross margins for the aviation, marine, outdoor, and fitness segments are typically more stable than in the automotive/mobile segment.
Our long-term gross margin targets are 65%, 60%, 65%, and 60%, respectively, for these segments.

Our existing practice
of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers
and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components. We believe that our flexible production model
allows our Sijhih, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants
to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing. In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.
Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales price variability has had and can
be expected to have an effect on our gross profit. In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have
declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points. The average selling prices of our
aviation, outdoor, fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products
sold at higher prices. The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have
a significant impact on our gross profit.

Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses consist of costs
for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners. In both 2012 and 2010, we reduced our advertising
expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology. In 2011, our advertising costs increased slightly
as we again experienced revenue growth. We expect advertising costs to decrease slightly in 2013 but to remain consistent as a
percentage of net sales.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily
of:

·

salaries for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

·

marketing, and other brand building costs;

·

accounting and legal costs;


·

information systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel and related costs; and

·

occupancy and other overhead costs.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased in 2012, 2011 and 2010. The 2012 increase was primarily driven by full year expenses associated
with acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011 and legal costs. The 2011 increase was primarily driven by acquisitions,
commissions associated with a new web-based sales program, bad debt expense, legal costs and product support costs. The 2010 increase
was primarily due to legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information
technology to support our growing installed base of users. We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising,
to be stable in 2013.

Research and Development

The majority of our research and development
costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and
prototype development. Approximately 80% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.

We are committed to increasing the level
of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation
markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices. We expect our research and development budget to increase in 2013 due to
our ongoing commitment to innovation and growth.

Customers

Our top ten customers have contributed
between 26% and 34% of net sales since 2010. We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between
70 and 78 days since 2010. We experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days in 2010 due to changes
in product mix, longer payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions but this was reduced in 2011. We expect the level of customer
accounts receivable days to be relatively stable in 2013.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively low effective
corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates. In
particular, the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of
our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital
investments have continued to reduce our tax rate. As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately 13.1% during
2012. This is an increase from an effective rate of 10.8% in 2011. The lower effective tax rate in 2011 was primarily driven by
the release of reserves related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations for Garmin Europe. This was partially offset
by the release of income tax reserves due to the expiration of a statute of limitations in Taiwan during 2012. We have taken advantage
of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through
2015. Management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2013, there may be less revenue recognized by
entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions.  Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be higher than
fiscal 2012.  The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital
investments made during fiscal 2013, the resolution of uncertain tax positions and the composition of our earnings.

Net sales decreased 2% in 2012 when compared
to the year-ago period.  The decrease was driven by automotive/mobile and marine with offsetting growth in outdoor, fitness
and aviation.  The outdoor segment experienced the greatest increase at 11% with fitness contributing 8% growth.  Automotive/mobile
revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 58% in 2011 to 55% in 2012.

Total unit sales decreased
3% to 15.4 million units in 2012 from 15.8 million units in 2011.   The declining unit sales volume in 2012 was primarily
attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American and European PND markets slowed due to penetration rates
and competing technologies. This decline was partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor and fitness segments, as well
as auto OEM units.

Automotive/mobile segment
revenue declined 6% in 2012, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 6%.   ASP was stable due
to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services,
as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year. The increase
in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $68.3 million of net sales in 2012 compared to $179.3 million of net
sales in 2011.  The reduced impact of deferred revenue is related to increased amortization of previously deferred revenues
and costs and a reduced per unit revenue deferral rate due to a change in accounting estimate in the third quarter of 2011, as
previously discussed, offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral..

Outdoor revenue increased
11% driven by market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category and the dog tracking and training portfolio including the benefit
of an acquisition completed in the second half of 2011. Fitness segment revenue increased 8% on the strength of recent product
introductions and ongoing global penetration though slowing from 24% growth in the prior year when we had significant promotional
activity on discontinued products.  Marine revenues decreased 6% due to a difficult international marine environment. 
Aviation revenues increased 2% as the Company’s OEM business began to recover but was partially offset by declining sales
of retrofit and portable products.

The Company anticipates
revenue of $2.5 - $2.6 billion in 2013 driven by growth in the outdoor, fitness, aviation and marine segments offset by ongoing
declines in the automotive/mobile segment. In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new
products are essential for future revenue growth.

Cost of goods sold
decreased 10% in 2012 when compared to the year-ago period primarily due to unit volume declines discussed above, component cost
reductions, a mix shift toward higher margin new products and certain factors specific to the automotive/mobile segment discussed
below. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues for the automotive/mobile segment decreased by 560 basis points. The
decline principally resulted from a $21 million one-time royalty fee benefit recorded in second quarter (140 basis points) and
subsequent impact of reduced royalty costs, a reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and costs including the
reduced per unit deferral rate as discussed above (280 basis points), component price reductions and product mix shifting toward
more recently introduced products carrying a higher margin profile.

Fitness and marine
posted declines in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due to product mix moving toward newer products with increased
features, functionality and higher per unit margins, as well as decreased promotional activities. Aviation posted a decline in
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue due primarily to product mix and a prior year OEM contribution that negatively impacted
revenues.

Management believes
that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will decline in 2013 given the growth in segments with higher margin profiles
than corporate average and current component pricing.

Gross profit dollars in 2012 increased
7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 450 basis points compared to 2011.  Gross profit margins increased in all
segments, excluding outdoor, when compared to 2011.

The automotive/mobile
segment gross profit margin percentage increased 560 basis points driven primarily by the one-time royalty fee adjustment, a $90
million reduction in the year-over-year impact of deferred revenue and cost including the reduced per unit deferral rate partially
offset by the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral, reduced component pricing and improved product mix,
as discussed above.

Fitness and marine
gross profit margin percentage increased 260 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily
by product mix improvement and less promotional activity in the current year, as discussed above. Aviation gross profit margin
percentage increased 320 basis points driven primarily by product mix and a prior year OEM contribution, as discussed above.

Management believes
that total company gross margins will increase in 2013 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles than corporate
average.

Advertising expense
decreased in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2011.  The decrease in absolute dollars
resulted from reduced cooperative advertising on lower sales in the PND category partially offset by increased cooperative advertising
and media placement within the outdoor, fitness and marine segments.

Management expects
to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2013.

Selling, general and
administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2011.  As a percent
of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 120 basis points in 2012. The expense increase was primarily
driven by full year expense for acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011, which added almost $20 million, and increased
legal costs and reserves partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense and commissions expense.

Management expects
selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable in absolute dollars in 2013.

Research and development expense increased
9% due to ongoing development activities for new products and the addition of over 375 new engineering personnel with an emphasis
on OEM opportunities within aviation, auto and marine.   In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased
$27.2 million when compared with the year-ago period and increased 120 basis points as a percent of revenue.

Management believes
that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction
of new products. Management expects that its research and development expenses will increase during fiscal 2013 on an absolute
dollar basis and as a percent of revenue in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.

Other income (expense)
principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Interest income for fiscal 2012 increased
due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year offset by a slight decline in interest rates.

Foreign currency gains
and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling. The
Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation. The U.S. Dollar remains the functional currency of Garmin Europe.
The Euro is the functional currency of most European subsidiaries. As these entities have grown, currency moves can generate material
gains and losses. Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.
Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro and the British Pound Sterling,
currency fluctuations within these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $20.0 million currency
loss in 2012 was due primarily to weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar. The movements of the Taiwan Dollar
and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held
in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue. During 2012, the U.S. Dollar
weakened 3.8% compared to the Taiwan Dollar resulting in a loss of $31.3 million. This was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar
weakening 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a $10.4 million gain.
The remaining net currency gain of $0.8 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.


The $12.1 million currency
loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro. During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened
1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million. A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening
1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year. The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million
is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

Income Tax Provision

Our earnings before
taxes increased 7% when compared to 2011 while our income tax expense increased by 30% to $82.1 million, compared to $63.3 million
for fiscal year 2011. The significant increase in income tax expense was primarily due to a decrease in the income eligible for
tax holiday in Taiwan, unfavorable income mix toward higher tax jurisdictions and an increase in uncertain tax position reserves,
net of amounts released due to expiration of statutes of limitations, and the impact of no research and development credit in 2012.

Net Income

As a result of the
various factors noted above, net income increased 4% to $542.4 million for fiscal year 2012 compared to $520.9 million for fiscal
year 2011.

Net sales increased 3% in 2011 when compared
to the year-ago period.  The increase occurred in all segments excluding automotive/mobile.  The fitness segment experienced
the greatest increase at 24% with outdoor contributing 14% growth.  Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion
of our revenue mix, but declined from 62% in 2010 to 58% in 2011.

Total unit sales decreased
1% to 15.8 million units in 2011 from 16.0 million units in 2010.   The declining unit sales volume in 2011 was attributable
to a decline in automotive/mobile units as the North American PND market slowed due to penetration rates and competing technologies
partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments.

Automotive/mobile segment
revenue declined 5% in 2011, as the average selling price (ASP) was flat and volumes declined 5%.   ASP was stable due
to the substantial increase in our bundled product offerings, which include lifetime map updates and premium traffic services,
as a percentage of total units sold, offset by a decrease in the ASP of comparable models from the previous year. The increase
in product mix toward bundled offerings required us to defer $179.3 million of net sales in 2011 compared to $131.3 million of
net sales in 2010.  This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to a change in accounting estimate.
 As bundled products increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales in 2011, including the impact of new product
introductions, market conditions also caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year.  In addition,
the difference in pricing of such bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably since 2010.  Due to
the impact of these and other factors, the Company changed its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the third
quarter of 2011. The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in net sales of $77.8 million in 2011.


Fitness segment revenue
increased 24% on the strength of recent product introductions and ongoing global penetration.  Outdoor revenue increased 14%
driven by new product introductions and market share gains in the GPS-enabled golf category. Marine revenues increased 12% due
to shipments to new OEM partners and market share gains.  Aviation revenues increased 9% as the Company’s retrofit business
began to recover on the strength of new panel mount avionics products.

Cost of goods sold
increased 6% in 2011 when compared to the year-ago period. Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points
due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.  This adjustment impacted
all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor, fitness and marine having the largest benefits.   Excluding this 2010 adjustment,
cost of goods sold increased 3% which is consistent with the change in revenue.

Cost per unit increased
in all segments with increases in outdoor and fitness generally consistent with ASP increases. Automotive/mobile increased due
to product mix shifting toward bundled PNDs. Marine and aviation cost per unit increases exceeded ASP growth which negatively impacted
gross margins for these respective segments due to product mix shift toward fishfinders in marine and retrofit panel mount products
in aviation.

Gross profit dollars
in 2011 decreased 1% while gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points compared to 2010.  Gross profit margins
declined in all segments when compared to 2010.  Gross margins in 2010 were positively impacted due to the $42.8 million warranty
adjustment related to the refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.

The automotive/mobile
segment gross profit margin percentage decreased 280 basis points driven primarily by the 2010 warranty benefit and the deferral
of high margin revenue associated with bundled products. The substantial increase in product mix toward products bundled with lifetime
maps required us to defer greater amounts of revenue and related costs, thereby lowering gross profit by $143.2 million in the
current year compared to $99.9 million for the prior year. This year-over-year impact did lessen in the back half of 2011 due to
the previously discussed change in accounting estimate. The impact of the change in estimate was an increase in gross profit of
$66.5 million in 2011.

Outdoor and fitness
gross profit margin percentage decreased 150 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively, from the prior year driven primarily
by the 2010 warranty benefit. Marine gross profit margin percentage decreased 420 basis points driven by the 2010 warranty benefit,
a 2011 increase in warranty reserves to account for geographic mix and a product mix shift toward lower margin products including
fishfinders. Aviation gross profit margin percentage decreased 300 basis points driven primarily by a lower margin profile for
our retrofit panel mount products.

Advertising expense
increased slightly in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2010.  As a percent of revenues,
advertising expenses were 5% in both 2011 and 2010.  The slight increase in absolute dollars resulted from increased investment
for outdoor and fitness advertising, which are the segments experiencing the most growth, offset by reduced cooperative advertising
paid to our retail partners as PND units declined and the elimination of mobile handset specific advertising.

expense increase was primarily driven by acquisitions ($21.3 million), commissions associated with a new web-based sales program
($4.3 million), bad debt expense ($3.5 million), legal costs ($9.3 million), and product support costs ($6.1 million). Aviation
costs declined year-over-year due to a reduction in bad debt expense driven by improved cash collections.

Other income (expense)
principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Interest income for fiscal 2011 increased
due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year and a slight increase in interest rates.

The $12.1 million currency
loss in 2011 was due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro. The movements of the Taiwan Dollar
and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held
in non-functional currency while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue. During 2011, the U.S. Dollar
strengthened 1.3% compared to the Euro resulting in a loss of $4.8 million. A loss of $4.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar
weakening 1.2% against the Taiwan Dollar as the asset balances fluctuated throughout the year. The remaining net currency loss
of $3.2 million is related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $88.4 million currency
loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the
weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar. During 2011, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to
the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million. A loss of $38.7 million resulted due
to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar. The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million is related to other
currencies and timing of transactions.


Income Tax Provision

Our earnings before
taxes increased 1% when compared to 2010 and our income tax expense increased by $70.6 million, to $63.3 million for fiscal year
2011 from ($7.3) million for fiscal year 2010. The significant increase in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time
items booked in 2010.  The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006
to 2009 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year
in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.  Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective
tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 10.8% for 2011.  The decrease is primarily due to the 2011 release of reserves related
to the expiration of certain statutes for Garmin Europe, a reduction in the statutory tax rate in Taiwan from 25% to 17%, and improved
operating profitability in lower tax jurisdictions.

Net Income

As a result of the
various factors noted above, net income decreased 11% to $520.9 million for fiscal year 2011 compared to $584.6 million for fiscal
year 2010.

The $137.6 million decrease in cash provided
by operating activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:

·

accounts receivable providing $160.5 million less cash primarily due
to lower revenue in 2012 and the impact of the 53-week fiscal year in 2011 which allowed for additional collections

·

deferred revenue/costs providing $90.8 million less working capital
benefit due to the increased amortization of previously deferred revenue/cost and reduced per unit revenue deferrals, offset by
the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral, all of which is discussed in the Results of Operations section
above, and

·

income taxes payable providing $51.5 million less cash due to increased
payments and the timing of disbursements during the year

Partially offset by:

·

other current and non-current assets providing $100.7 million more
cash due primarily to the payment of tax withholdings of $51.4 million to the Swiss Federal Tax Authority in 2011 and the refund
of those withholdings in 2012

·

other current and non-current liabilities providing $27.9 million
more cash due to lower royalty costs and the timing of such payments

·

net income increasing by $21.5 million as discussed in the Results
of Operations section above, and

·

the impact of increasing unrealized foreign currency losses providing
$21.4 million more cash

The $51.7 million increase in cash provided
by operating activities in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the following:

·

accounts payable, other current and non-current liabilities and income
taxes payable providing $106.8 million more cash due primarily to the benefit from the release of uncertain tax position reserves
in 2010, as discussed in the Results of Operations section above, as well as the timing of trade credit and royalty payments


·

inventories providing $70.7 million more cash due to lower inventory
levels required to meet reduced sales forecasts

·

deferred revenue/costs providing $43.4 million more working capital
benefit due to the increased deferral of revenue/cost and the impact of increased sales of bundled units requiring deferral offset
by reduced per unit revenue deferrals, all of which is discussed in the Results of Operations section above, and

·

accounts receivable providing $39.8 million more cash primarily due
to the impact of the 53-week fiscal year in 2011 which allowed for additional customer collections

Partially offset by:

·

other current and non-current assets providing $67.6 million less
cash due primarily to a receivable of $51.4 million from the Swiss Federal Tax Authority for payments made in 2011

·

net income decreasing by $63.7 million as discussed in the Results
of Operations section above

·

the impact of decreasing unrealized foreign currency losses providing
$44.2 million less cash, and

·

deferred income taxes providing $42.0 million less cash due primarily
to the impact of increased deferred revenue

We expect to generate
$500 - $550 million of cash flow from operations in 2013 with ongoing net income.

$40 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.
It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin’s investment policy, which has been approved
by the Board of Directors. The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree
of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk. Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash
and investments during fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010 were approximately 1.4%, 1.6%, and 1.2%, respectively.

Net cash used in financing activities

)

(307,413

)

(510,821

)

The $57.6 million decrease
in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 was primarily due to the following:

·

decreased dividend payments of $57.4 million
due to the timing of our calendar fourth quarter 2012 dividend occurring after the close of our fiscal year

The $203.4 million
decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2011 compared to fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to the following:

·

decreased treasury stock purchases primarily
due to the significant treasury stock transactions associated with our Swiss redomestication in 2010, as further discussed in Note
12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Our dividend has progressively
increased from $1.50 per share in calendar 2010 to $1.60 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2011 and $1.80
per share for the four calendar quarters beginning in June 2012.

We currently use cash flow from operations
to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, and to pay dividends. We expect that future cash
requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, payment of dividends declared, share repurchases and
the funding of strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient
to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2013.

Operating leases describes

The Company is a party
to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our
business.  Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $186,883
over the next five years.

We may be required
to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits. However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future
cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of
cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $181.8 million as of
December 29, 2012, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above. For further information related to unrecognized
tax benefits, see Note 2, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.


Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk primarily in connection
with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both
significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able
to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions
in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has had
a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs were to become subject to significant
inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure
to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The operation of Garmin’s
subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant
foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign
exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

The currencies that create a majority of
the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Garmin Corporation, headquartered
in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end
exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year. In order to minimize the effect of the currency
exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in
marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

Most
European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency

.

The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary,
Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency
gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The Company
believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows. In 2012, the U.S. Dollar
weakened 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively, relative to the Euro and British Pound Sterling resulting in a foreign currency gain of $10.4
million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.

The U.S. Dollar weakened 3.8% against the Taiwan Dollar resulting
in a $31.3 million foreign currency loss due to the fluctuation of asset balances throughout the year.

The
net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $0.8 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was
a net loss of $20.0 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $129.0 million at the end of fiscal 2012.

Interest Rate Risk

We have no outstanding
long-term debt as of December 29, 2012. We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are exposed to interest
rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities. As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses
associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly. A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material
effect on such unrealized gains or losses. At December 29, 2012, pre-tax cumulative net unrealized gains on those securities were
$10.4 million.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP

Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the related consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 29, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's Board of Directors and management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries
at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 29, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

GARMIN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In Thousands, Except Share and Per
Share Information)

December 29, 2012 and December 31,

1. Description of the Business

Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries
(together, the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products
and other related products. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s
products to the Company’s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s
products in the Americas region and for most of the Company’s research and new product development. GII also manufactures
most of the Company’s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing
of the Company’s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL’s sales are to other Company-owned
distributors in the EMEA region.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of
Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The
accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year

The Company has adopted
a 52–53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks
in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each
calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal
years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.

In those resulting
fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore,
the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the
prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks. Fiscal years 2012 and 2010 included
52 weeks while fiscal year 2011 included 53 weeks.

Foreign Currency

Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries
utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by the

Foreign Currency
Matters

topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements
of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the
reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and
at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’
equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of $128,972 and $76,456 as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively,
have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.


Transactions in foreign
currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these
transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All differences are recorded in results
of operations and amounted to exchange losses of $20,022, $12,100, and $88,377 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December
31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively. The loss in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the weakening of the USD against the
Taiwan Dollar and was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling. The loss in fiscal
2011 was primarily the result of the slight strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the slight weakening of the USD against
the Taiwan Dollar. The loss in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the British
Pound Sterling and the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per
share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings
per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number
of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s
stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 10.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities
of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short
maturity of those instruments.

Trade Accounts Receivable

The Company sells
its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s
financial condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition.
The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within
80 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential
losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing
its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful
in collecting the amount due. In 2011, Garmin purchased credit insurance to provide security against large losses.

Inventories

Inventories are stated
at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Inventories consisted of the
following:

Long-Lived Assets

As required by the

Property, Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived
asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition
of the asset. That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability. An impairment
loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.

The

Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other

topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that they may be impaired. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2012,
2011, or 2010.  The accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their estimated
useful lives and reviewed for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with finite lives
over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.

Dividends

On June 27, 2010,
the Company completed the redomestication of the place of its incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland. Under Swiss
corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.

On June 1, 2012, the
shareholders approved a dividend of $1.80 per share (of which, $0.90 was paid in the Company's 2012 fiscal year) payable in four
installments as follows: $0.45 on June 29, 2012 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2012, $0.45 on September 28, 2012 to shareholders
of record on September 14, 2012, $0.45 on December 31, 2012 to shareholders of record on December 14, 2012 and $0.45 on March
29, 2013 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2013. The Company paid dividends in 2012 in the amount of $253,386. Both the dividend
paid and the remaining dividend payable have been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On June 3, 2011, the
shareholders approved a dividend of $2.00 per share (of which, $1.60 was paid in the Company's 2011 fiscal year) payable in four
installments as follows: $0.80 on June 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2011, $0.40 on September 30, 2011 to shareholders
of record on September 15, 2011, $0.40 on December 30, 2011 to shareholders of record on December 15, 2011 and $0.40 on March
30, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 15, 2012. The Company paid dividends in 2011 in the amount of $310,763. The dividends
were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On March 16, 2010
the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on April 30, 2010 to shareholders of record on April
15, 2010. The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $298,853. The dividend was reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately $254,986
and $239,470 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan
at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.


Intangible Assets

At December 29, 2012
and December 31, 2011, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets
recorded at a cost of $181,918 and $173,819, respectively. Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years. Accumulated amortization was $125,380 and $106,648 at
December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $21,437, $24,831, and
$28,734 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively. In the next five years,
the amortization expense is estimated to be $21,239, $10,960, $8,311, $6,269, and $2,754, respectively.

The Company’s
excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $176,059 at December 29, 2012 and $179,475 at December
31, 2011.

The decrease in net

other purchases of intangible assets.

Marketable
Securities

Management determines
the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date.

All of the Company’s
marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 29, 2012. See Note 3. Available-for-sale securities are stated
at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss). At December 29,
2012 and December 31, 2011, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of $9,582 and $10,737, respectively, were reported in accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.

The amortized cost
of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity,
or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest
income from investments. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other
income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts
for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC topic

Income Taxes

. The liability method provides
that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Income taxes of $295,446, $277,724, and $257,727 at December 29, 2012, December
31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of
its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.


The Company adopted
the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC topic

Income Taxes

related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.   The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December
29, 2012 was $181,754 including interest of $7,680.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized
tax benefits for years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 is as follows:

The December 29, 2012
balance of $181,754 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized
tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.

Accounting guidance
requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be
paid within one year of the balance sheet date.  The entire $181,754, $161,904, and $153,621 are required to be classified
as non-current at December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.

Interest and penalties,
if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.  At December 29, 2012, December 31,
2011, and December 25, 2010, the Company had accrued approximately $7,680, $10,850, and $9,580, respectively, for interest. 
The interest component of the reserve increased (decreased) income tax expense for the years ending December 29, 2012, December
31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 by ($3,719), $5,568, and ($10,580), respectively. The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties
as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.

The Company files
income tax returns in Switzerland and U.S. federal jurisdictions, as well as various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. 
The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2008 and prior. 
The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2006 and prior.  The Company
is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years 2009 and prior.

The Company recognized
a reduction of income tax expense of $9,349, $19,610, and $24,066 in fiscal years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011,
and December 25, 2010, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions.

The Company believes
that it is reasonably possible that approximately $78,372 of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease
within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations. This potential decrease in unrecognized
tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company grants
credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not
require security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements and typically have been within management’s expectations. Certain customers are allowed extended terms
consistent with normal industry practice. Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales
variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.

The Company’s
top ten customers have contributed between 26% and 34% of net sales since 2010. None of the Company’s customers accounted
for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010. Beginning
in 2011, the Company has maintained trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.

Revenue Recognition

Garmin recognizes
revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and
collection is probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped
and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products
and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition
accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone
sales of software products and sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. 
The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

Garmin introduced
nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program’s terms and conditions,
enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND. 
The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale
and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products. With the acquisition of Navigon
AG in 2011, products marketed under the Navigon brand have a FreshMaps program that enables customers to download the latest map
and point of interest information for two years. The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of FreshMaps products
are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the two year period.

For multiple element
arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product’s functionality
and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue
to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy
to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective
evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and (iii) best
estimate of the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately,
on more than a limited basis, at prices within a relatively narrow range. In addition to the products listed below, the Company
has offered certain other products including mobile applications, aviation subscriptions and extended warranties that involve
multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.

In 2010, Garmin began
offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMUs) bundled in the original purchase price. Similar to nüMaps Lifetime™,
LMUs enable customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their
PND. In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic service bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.
The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs which include either the LMU
or premium traffic service. The first deliverable is the hardware along with the software essential to the functionality of the
hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is either the LMU or premium traffic service. The Company
has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Amounts allocated to the delivered
hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition
have been met.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU or the subscription for premium traffic
service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.


Prior to the third
quarter of fiscal 2011, Garmin determined its estimate of selling price using the dealer/distributor price for nüMaps Lifetime
or premium traffic subscriptions sold separately, and the prices for products bundled with and without the LMU and premium traffic
service when comparable models were available, as inputs to the relative selling price method in a manner similar to VSOE. The
estimated selling price determined in this manner was used to defer revenues for all products bundled with the LMU and premium
traffic service, as the number of bundled units sold as a percentage of total units sold was less significant and other indicators
of selling price were not readily available.

During 2011, sales
of products bundled with LMUs and premium traffic service increased significantly as a percentage of total product sales. Concurrently,
market conditions caused decreases in the ASP and margins of comparable models year over year, new bundled products were introduced
at lower ASPs, and the difference in pricing of bundled units and comparable unbundled models decreased considerably. Due to these
changes, the Company determined it was appropriate to change its estimate of the per unit revenue and cost deferrals during the
third quarter of 2011.

As the sales of nüMaps
Lifetime and premium traffic subscriptions as a percentage of total unit sales or in the aggregate decreased significantly in
mid-2011, the Company determined that the previous estimate of selling price based on more limited stand-alone sales of nüMaps
Lifetime or premium traffic was no longer a sole determinant of its value as determined under VSOE, and that third party evidence
of selling price was not available. Management determined that the price differential between bundled and unbundled products and
the royalty cost of the LMU or premium traffic subscription plus an approximate margin were both additional indicators of estimated
selling price. These estimates are also reflective of how the Company establishes product pricing based in part on customer perception
of value of the added LMU or premium traffic service capability. As such, beginning in the third quarter of 2011, the Company
changed its estimate of selling price of the undelivered element to be based on the relative selling price method using a weighted
average of the stand-alone sales price, the price differential between bundled and unbundled units, and the royalty or subscription
cost plus a normal margin.

The impact in 2011
of the change in estimate for lifetime map updates and premium traffic service, as described above, was an increase in revenue,
gross profit, net income, basic net income per share, and diluted net income per share of $77.8 million, $66.5 million, $59.3
million, $0.31, and $0.30, respectively.

Garmin records estimated
reductions to revenue for customer sales programs, returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product
discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases),
promotions and other volume-based incentives. The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical
experience and expectation of future conditions. Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results.
These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued
for on a percentage of sales basis. If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive
offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.

The Company records revenue net of sales
tax, trade discounts and customer returns. The reductions to revenue for expected future product returns are based on the Company’s
historical experience.


Deferred Revenues
and Costs

At December 29, 2012
and December 31, 2011, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $445,422 and $377,119, respectively, and related deferred costs
totaling $96,307 and $80,856, respectively.

The deferred revenues
and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis. In the next three
years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $198,427,
$113,528, and $37,160, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling
costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Product Warranty

The Company provides
for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty period for most products is one year to two years from date of
shipment while certain aviation products have a warranty period of two years from the date of installation

.

Sales Programs

The Company provides
certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing
volume and growth. Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products. Estimated rebates
and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.
In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older
products from their inventories in advance of new product releases. Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied
to all customers who have purchased the product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis. These
rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
in the period the Company has sold the product.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses
advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $138,757, $145,024, and $144,613 for the years ended
December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively.

Research and
Development

A majority of the
Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are expensed
as incurred, amounted to approximately $325,773, $298,584, and $277,261 for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011,
and December 25, 2010, respectively.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and
technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements
of income. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer
inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance
to customers. The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. The related cost of
providing this free support is not material.


Software Development Costs

The FASB ASC
topic entitled

Software

requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release
to customers. Capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is
typically short. As required by the

Research and Development

topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing
products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included
in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently sponsors four stock based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled

Compensation –
Stock Compensation

requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made
to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values. See Note 9.

Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based
compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately
expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at
the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures
were estimated based on historical experience and management’s estimates.

Reclassification

The consolidated balance
sheet for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects a reclassification decreasing noncurrent deferred income tax assets by $18.5
million with increases of $10.7 million to current deferred income tax assets and $7.8 million to prepaid expenses and other current
assets, to conform to the current year presentation. This reclassification had no effect on net income.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2011, the FASB
issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to fair value measurements and disclosure requirements that result in
a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for the measurement and disclosure of fair value between U.S. GAAP
and International Financial Reporting Standards. This standard provides certain amendments to the existing guidance on the use
and application of fair value measurements and maintains a definition of fair value that is based on the notion of exit price.
This guidance is effective as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011. The Company adopted this
guidance in the current year with no material impact on the financial statements.

In June 2011, the
FASB issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income. This guidance eliminates the current option to report other
comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders’ equity. The guidance allows two presentation alternatives;
present items in net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement, referred to as the statement of comprehensive
income, or in two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. This guidance is effective
as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, but full retrospective
application is required under both sets of accounting standards. The Company adopted this guidance in the current year and has
chosen to present two separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income.


In September 2011,
the FASB issued an amendment to ASC 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other, which simplifies how entities test goodwill for
impairment. Under the amendment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence
of events or circumstances leads the entity to determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its
carrying amount. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines that it is not more likely than
not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the two-step impairment test for goodwill
is unnecessary. If the entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to test goodwill for impairment under the two-step process
as described under paragraphs 350-20-35-4 of the ASC. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then
the entity is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss,
if any, as described in paragraph 350-20-35-9 of the ASC. The amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment
tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance
in the current year with no material impact on the financial statements.

In July 2012, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02 “Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment”
(ASU 2012-02), which is included in ASC Topic 350 (Intangibles—Goodwill and Other). ASU 2012-02 provides an option for companies
to use a qualitative approach to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if certain conditions are met. The amendments
are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012 (early adoption
is permitted). The implementation of the amended accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

3. Marketable Securities

The FASB ASC topic
entitled

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The
accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liability

Level 2

Observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or
    indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
    assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
    or liability

Level 3

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

The Company endeavors
to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety
based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation methods used by the Company
for each significant class of investments are summarized below.

Mortgage-backed securities,
corporate bonds and obligations of states and political subdivisions – Valued based on prices obtained from an independent
pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar
assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows,
benchmark yields, and credit spreads.

Common stocks – Valued
at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.


The methods described
above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the
use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different
fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Available for sale securities measured
at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

During 2012, the Company
determined the inputs used to value its investments in corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and obligations of state and
political subdivisions were based on observable market information consistent with Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, rather
than Level 1 as reported in the 2011 financial statements. Accordingly, the amounts shown in the 2011 table above have been revised
to reflect the correct presentation.

For assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the period, a reconciliation
of the beginning and ending balances, separately for each major category of assets, is required. There were no such assets or
liabilities held during 2012. A reconciliation for 2011 is as follows:

The cost of securities
sold is based on the specific identification method.

The unrealized losses
and unrealized gains on the Company’s investments in 2012 and 2011 were caused primarily by changes in interest rates and
credit spreads. The Company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing
the potential risk of principal loss. The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in
the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of
their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature. Fair
values were determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary
impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which
may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. During 2012 and 2011, the Company did not record any material impairment
charges on its outstanding securities.

The amortized cost
and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 29, 2012, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities
will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without
prepayment penalties.

Certain cash balances
of GEL are held as collateral by a bank, securing payment of the United Kingdom value-added tax requirements. The total amount
of restricted cash balances were $836 and $771 at December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

The Company is party
to certain commitments, which includes raw materials, advertising and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our
business. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company is contractually committed to make purchases of approximately $186,883 over
the next five years.

In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters
involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks. It is not possible to predict with
certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not,
what the impact might be. However, the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

5. Employee Benefit Plans

GII and the Company’s
other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute
up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute
a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan.
Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation.
In both the plans described above, the subsidiaries contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. During the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, expense related to these plans
of $22,159, $20,647, and $17,952, respectively, was charged to operations.

Certain of the Company’s
foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans. Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider
final pensionable salaries. Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and
December 25, 2010, were significant.

The holding company
statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the redomestication effective June
27, 2010 (see Note 12), is 7.83%.  If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate
to the reported income tax for 2012, as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately
$170,000 lower, or $49,000, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $31,000.
For 2011, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $159,000 lower, or $45,000, and the foreign
tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $11,000. For 2010, the amounts related to tax at
the U.S. statutory rate of 35% prior to the redomestication and the Swiss statutory rate of 7.83%, subsequent to the redomestication,
would be approximately $96,000 lower, or $106,000, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately
($20,000). All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.


The Company’s
income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $495,908, $473,994, and $413,550, for the years ended December
29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively. The Taiwan tax holiday benefits included in the table above
reflect $0.03, $0.07, and $0.07 per weighted-average common share outstanding for the years ended December 29, 2012, December
31, 2011, and December 25, 2010, respectively. The Company currently expects to benefit from these Taiwan tax holidays through
2016, at which time these tax benefits might expire.

Deferred income taxes
reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities

The Company recognized
a $29,615 deferred tax asset during 2010 for the future tax benefit of the fair market value step-up in basis of intangible assets
related to the redomestication to Switzerland and local statutory tax reporting requirements. The deferred tax asset was recognized
as an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital in 2010 and will reverse as the intangible assets are amortized for Swiss statutory
and tax reporting purposes.

At December 29, 2012,
the Company had $46,577 of tax credit carryover which includes $41,553 of Taiwan surtax credit with no expiration. There is a
full valuation allowance for the Taiwan surtax credits. The valuation allowance reflects a net increase of $14,220 during 2012
including $10,314 related to Taiwan surtax credits. The valuation allowance decreased in 2011 by $14,179 of which $14,994 related
to surtax credits in Taiwan.

At December 29, 2012,
the Company had a deferred tax asset of $15,771 related to the future tax benefit on net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of
$73,298.  Included in the NOL carryforwards is $11,990 that relates to Spain and expires in varying amounts between 2022
and 2025, $24,604 that relates to Switzerland and expires in 2018, $2,218 related to China that expires in 2017 and $34,486 that
relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion
of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.
In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its
deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.


7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments
are held or issued for trading purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are

carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

8. Segment Information

Beginning in 2011,
for external reporting purposes, the Company identified five operating segments – auto/mobile, aviation, marine, outdoor
and fitness. Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates
resources and assesses performance of each segment individually. Prior to 2011, the Outdoor and Fitness operating segments were
combined into a single reportable segment due to the similar nature of those products, their production processes, the types of
customers served, their distribution processes, and similar economic conditions. Management re-evaluated the combination of these
operating segments and determined that based on the growth characteristics of these segments they should now be reported as two
distinct reportable segments.

All of the Company’s
reportable segments offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through
OEM’s. However, the nature of products and types of customers for the five reportable segments vary. The Company’s
marine, auto/mobile, outdoor, and fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories
sold primarily to retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan. The Company’s
aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are
sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The Company’s
Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the CODM. The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income
before income taxes of each segment.

Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including
certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating
corporate expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The Company’s
reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business. Thus, the Company
does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment
to the CODM.


Revenues, interest
income and interest expense, and income before income taxes for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented

9. Stock Compensation
Plans

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

The various Company
stock compensation plans are summarized below. For all stock compensation plans, the company’s policy is to issue treasury
shares for exercises of options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), releases of restricted stock units (“RSUs”),
and issues of shares under the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”).

2011 Non-employee
Directors’ Equity Incentive Plan

In June 2011, the
stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the 2011 Directors Plan) providing for grants of stock
options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to 122,592 shares were available for issuance. The term of
each award cannot exceed ten years. Awards may vest over a minimum two-year period. During 2012 and 2011, 9,616 and 11,996 restricted
stock units were granted under this plan.

2005 Equity
Incentive Plan

In June 2005, the
shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified
stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to
10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The various grants vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not
exercised. Beginning December 10, 2012, restricted stock unit grants will vest evenly over a period of three years. During 2012,
2011, and 2010, 495,814, 410,197, and 494,995 restricted stock units were granted under the 2005 Plan. In addition, in 2012 and
2011, 61,235 and 42,330 stock options were granted under the 2005 Plan. In 2010, 20,000 performance shares were granted under
the 2005 Plan. No performance shares were granted under the 2005 Plan in 2012 and 2011.

2000 Equity
Incentive Plan

In October 2000, the
shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified
stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to
7,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period
of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years
from the date of grant, if not exercised. The Company did not grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2012, 2011 or 2010.

2000 Non-employee
Directors’ Option Plan

Also in October 2000,
the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the 2000 Directors Plan) providing for grants of options
for up to 100,000 common shares. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over a three-year period. In 2009,
the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000.
During 2010, options to purchase 23,924 shares, respectively, were granted under this plan. Following the June 2011 approval of
the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares under this plan.


Stock-Based
Compensation Activity

A summary of the Company’s
stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the
2000 Directors Plan for the years ended December 29, 2012, December 31, 2011, and December 25, 2010 is provided below:

The weighted-average
remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 29, 2012 is 4.05 and 3.92 years, respectively.
The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 29, 2012 was 1.85 years.

The fair value for
these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2012, 2011, and 2010:

The Black-Scholes
option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options and SARs which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including
the expected stock price volatility.

The total fair value
of awards vested during 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $32,612, $49,006, and $41,249, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic values of
options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 29, 2012 were $23,159 and $23,086, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic
values of options and SARs exercised during 2012, 2011, and 2010 were $12,548, $14,367, and $12,259, respectively. The aggregate
intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 29, 2012 was $58,394. The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2012,
2011, and 2010 were $17,390, $14,592, and $8,828, respectively. Aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference between
the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period, which was $40.00 on December 29, 2012, and
the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised. As of December 29, 2012, there was $45,265 of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans.
That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

The shareholders also
adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP with shareholders
approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in May 2010. Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85%
of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period.
The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
During 2012, 2011, and 2010, 326,483, 514,218, and 349,173 shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for a total purchase
price of $10,629, $13,746, and $8,134, respectively. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, the purchases were issued from treasury shares.
At December 29, 2012, approximately 1,234,583 shares were available for future issuance.

of diluted earnings per share because the effect was antidilutive.

11. Share Repurchase Program

The Board of Directors
approved a share repurchase program on February 12, 2010, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares
as market and business conditions warrant on the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC’s
Rule 10b-18. The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2011. Under the plan, the Company had repurchased 7,366,646
shares using cash of $223,149 in fiscal 2010.

In addition, 522,856
shares repurchased for $16,701 prior to the Company’s redomestication to Switzerland on June 27, 2010, but for which transactions
settled after that date, were treated as retired when such shares were still in treasury. These shares were reflected as additional
treasury shares during the 13-weeks ended March 26, 2011 with a corresponding increase to retained earnings.

12. Redomestication

The redomestication
effectively changed the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of Garmin from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.

The redomestication
involved several steps. On February 9, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) formed Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) as a direct subsidiary.
On April 6, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) petitioned the Cayman Court to order, among other things, the calling of a meeting
of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) common shareholders to approve a scheme of arrangement. On April 7, 2010, the Cayman Court ordered
us to seek shareholder approval of the scheme of arrangement. On May 20, 2010 we obtained the necessary shareholder approval.
 On June 4, 2010, a hearing was held by the Cayman Court and at which hearing the Cayman Court was asked to and did
approve the scheme of arrangement.  The scheme of arrangement became effective at 3:00 a.m., Cayman Islands time, on Sunday,
June 27, 2010 (the “Transaction Time”).


At and shortly following
the Transaction Time, the following steps occurred:

1.

all issued and outstanding Garmin
                                                                Ltd. (Cayman) common shares were transferred to Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland);
                                                                and

2.

in consideration, Garmin Ltd.
                                                                (Switzerland) (a) issued registered shares (on a one-for-one
                                                                basis) to the holders of the Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) common shares
                                                                that were transferred to Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland), and (b) increased
                                                                the par value of the 10,000,000 shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland)
                                                                issued to Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) in connection with the formation
                                                                of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) (the “Formation Shares”)
                                                                to the same par value as the shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland)
                                                                issued to the Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) shareholders. The Formation
                                                                Shares were subsequently transferred by Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) to
                                                                its subsidiary, Garmin Luxembourg S.à r.l. for future use
                                                                to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares in connection with
                                                                awards granted under our equity incentive plans for employees
                                                                and other general corporate purposes.

As a result of the
redomestication, the shareholders of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) became shareholders of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland), and Garmin Ltd. (Cayman)
became a subsidiary of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland). In addition, Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) assumed, on a one-for-one basis, Garmin
Ltd. (Cayman)’s existing obligations in connection with awards granted under Garmin Ltd. (Cayman)’s equity incentive
plans and other similar equity awards. Any stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units or performance shares
issued by Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into common shares of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) became
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the case may be, into registered shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland).

Subsequently
on July 26, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) relocated its registered office to Switzerland and changed its name to Garmin Switzerland
GmbH.  The reported capitalization of the Company also changed to that of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland).  Accordingly, common
stock was increased by $1,796,448 to $1,797,435 (198,077,418 shares * CHF 10/ USD 9.0744)

,

and retained earnings was reduced by the same amount.

On February 15, 2013,
the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the common
shares of Garmin Ltd.  The repurchases may be made from time to time as market and business conditions warrant on the open
market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC’s Rule 10b-18.  The timing and amounts of any repurchases
will be determined by the Company’s management depending on market conditions and other factors including price, regulatory
requirements and capital availability.  The program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares and may
be suspended or discontinued at any time. The share repurchase authorization expires on December 31, 2014.

The Company evaluated
subsequent events through the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K on February 27, 2013.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

(a) Conclusion
Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b)
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b) Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the
Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1,
31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.

Management of the
Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”.

Based on such assessment
and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 29, 2012.

Ernst & Young
LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued
an attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
of December 29, 2012, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin
Ltd.

We have audited Garmin Ltd.’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd.’s Board
of Directors and management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on
the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin
Ltd. and Subsidiaries

as of December 29, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 29,
2012 of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 27, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(d) Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the
quarter ended December 29, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.
