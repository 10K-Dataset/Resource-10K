Item 1.

Business

This discussion of the business of Garmin Ltd. ("Garmin" or the "Company") should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1.  Garmin has four business segments: Marine, Automotive/Mobile, Outdoor/Fitness, and Aviation.   The segment and geographic information included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” under Note 8 is incorporated herein by reference in partial
response to this Item 1.

Garmin was incorporated in Switzerland on February 9, 2010 as successor to Garmin Ltd., a Cayman Islands company  (“Garmin Cayman”). Garmin Cayman was incorporated on July 24, 2000 as a holding company for Garmin Corporation, a Taiwan corporation, in order to facilitate a public offering of Garmin Cayman shares in the United States. On June 27, 2010, Garmin became the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group of companies pursuant to a share exchange transaction effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the “Redomestication”).  Pursuant to
the Redomestication, all issued and outstanding Garmin Cayman common shares were transferred to Garmin and each common share, par value U.S. $0.005 per share, of Garmin Cayman was exchanged for one registered share, par value 10 Swiss francs (“CHF”) per share, of Garmin.  Garmin owns, directly or indirectly, all of the operating companies in the Garmin group.

Company Overview

Garmin is a leading, worldwide provider of navigation, communication and information devices and applications, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System (“GPS”) technology. Garmin designs, develops, manufactures and markets a diverse family of hand-held, portable and fixed-mount GPS-enabled products and other navigation, communications and information products for the automotive/mobile, outdoor/fitness, marine, and general aviation markets.

Overview of the Global Positioning System

The Global Positioning System is a worldwide navigation system which enables the precise determination of geographic location using established satellite technology. The system consists of a constellation of orbiting satellites. The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense, which maintains an ongoing satellite replenishment program to ensure continuous global system coverage.   Access to the system is provided free of charge by the U.S. government.

Prior to May 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense intentionally degraded the accuracy of civilian GPS signals in a process known as Selective Availability (‘‘SA’’) for national security purposes. SA variably degraded GPS position accuracy to a radius of 100 meters. On May 2, 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense discontinued SA. In a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. does not intend to implement SA again and is committed to preventing hostile use of GPS through regional denial of service, minimizing the impact to peaceful users. With SA removed, a GPS receiver can calculate its position to an accuracy of approximately 10
meters or less, enhancing the utility of GPS for most applications.

The accuracy and utility of GPS can be enhanced through augmentation techniques which compute any remaining errors in the signal and broadcast these corrections to a GPS device. The Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) has developed a Wide Area Augmentation System (‘‘WAAS’’) comprising ground reference stations and additional satellites that improve the accuracy of GPS positioning available in the United States and portions of Canada and Mexico to approximately 3 meters. WAAS supports the use of GPS as the primary means of enroute, terminal and approach navigation for aviation in the United States. The increased accuracy offered by WAAS also enhances the utility of
WAAS-enabled GPS receivers for consumer applications. The FAA announced on July 11, 2003 that the WAAS system had achieved initial operating capability and that the system was available for instrument flight use with appropriately certified avionics equipment. Since that time, the FAA has installed additional ground reference stations and has launched additional WAAS satellites.

Japan’s MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS) achieved initial operating capability for en route, terminal and approach navigation for aviation in September 27, 2007.  Garmin is working closely with the European Satellite Services Provider (ESSP) in preparation for the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) aviation Safety of Life (SoL) service declaration which is planned in 2011.

Competition

The market for navigation, communications and information products is highly competitive.  Garmin believes the principal competitive factors impacting the market for its products are design, functionality, quality and reliability, customer service, brand, price, time-to-market and availability.  Garmin believes that it generally competes favorably in each of these areas.

Garmin believes that its principal competitors for portable automotive products are TomTom N.V. and  MiTAC Digital Corporation (“MiTAC”) (which distributes products under the brand names of Magellan, Mio, and Navman) and Navigon AG. Garmin believes that its principal competitors for outdoor/fitness product lines are Magellan, a subsidiary of MiTAC, Lowrance Electronics, Inc., a subsidiary of Navico (“Lowrance”) and Delorme and that its principal competitors for fitness products are Nike, Inc., Polar Electro Oy, Suunto Oy, Timex Corp. and Bryton Corp.  For marine chartplotter products, Garmin believes that its principal competitors are Raymarine Inc.
(“Raymarine”), Furuno Electronic Company (“Furuno”), and Simrad and Lowrance (subsidiaries of Navico).  For Garmin’s fishfinder/depth sounder product lines, Garmin believes that its principal competitors are Lowrance, Raymarine, the Humminbird division of Johnson Outdoors, Inc., and Furuno. For Garmin’s general aviation product lines, Garmin considers its principal competitors to be Honeywell, Inc., Avidyne Corporation, L-3 Avionics Systems, Rockwell Collins, Inc., Sagem Avionics, Inc., Universal Avionics Systems Corporation, Chelton Flight Systems, Aspen Avionics, and Free Flight Systems for panel-mount GPS and display units.  For Garmin’s Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service product line, Garmin believes that its principal competitors are Motorola, Inc., Cobra Electronics Corporation and Midland Radio
Corporation.

Research and Development

Garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams.  Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered 2,340 people worldwide as of December 25, 2010.  Garmin’s manufacturing staff includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and cartographic
engineers.  Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success.  Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.

Manufacturing and Operations

Garmin believes that one of its core competencies and strengths is its manufacturing capability at its Sijhih, Jhongli and LinKou, Taiwan facilities, its Olathe, Kansas facility, and its Salem, Oregon facility.  Garmin believes that its vertically integrated approach has provided it the following benefits with respect to all products other than the legacy nüvifone products, which are manufactured by one or more third parties as part of the Garmin-Asus strategic alliance,  a few select marine products (VHF radios and AIS receivers), and our accessory products, all of which are also manufactured by one or more third parties.

Reduced time-to-market.

Utilizing concurrent engineering techniques, Garmin’s products are introduced to production at an early development stage and the feedback provided by manufacturing is incorporated into the design before mass production begins.  In this manner, Garmin attempts to reduce the time required to move a product from its design phase to mass production deliveries.

Design and process optimization.

Garmin uses its manufacturing resources to rapidly prototype design concepts, products and processes in order to achieve higher efficiency, improved quality and yields, lower cost and better value for customers.  Garmin’s ability to fully explore product design and manufacturing process concepts has enabled it to optimize its designs to minimize size and weight in GPS devices that are functional, waterproof, and rugged.

Logistical agility.

Operating our own manufacturing facilities helps Garmin minimize problems, such as component shortages and long component lead times which are common in the electronics industry.  Many products can be re-engineered to bypass component shortages or reduce cost and the new designs can be delivered to market quickly.  Garmin reacts rapidly to changes in market demand by striving to maintain a safety stock of long-lead components and by rescheduling components from one product line to another.   Operating our own manufacturing facilities also allows Garmin to quickly
adjust the mix of product production, helping to foster faster delivery response to the customer.

Garmin’s design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in our US, Taiwan, and UK facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization. Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facilities have also achieved TS 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers.  In addition, Garmin’s aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.

Garmin (Europe) Ltd and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO14001 standard.  This certification recognizes that Garmin’s UK and Taiwan subsidiaries have systems and processes in place to minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and to strive continually to improve its environmental performance.

Materials

Although most components essential to Garmin’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components, including, but not limited to, microprocessors, certain liquid crystal displays (“LCDs”), and certain  application-specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (“DRAM”), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and
commodity pricing fluctuations.


Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication, aviation electronics and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.  In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.  Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements for strategically important components.  Nevertheless, if  Garmin’s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to Garmin, the Garmin’s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Garmin’s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Garmin’s requirements

Seasonality

Our sales are subject to significant seasonal fluctuation.  Sales of our consumer products are generally significantly higher in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand for automotive/mobile products during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer marine season and the Father’s Day/graduation buying season.  Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products.  Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the
initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

Our sales are generally of a consumer nature and there is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.  We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains licenses for digital cartography technology for use in our products from various sources.

As of January 21, 2010, Garmin’s worldwide IP portfolio includes over 450 patents and 300 trademark registrations.  Garmin was selected as a constituent of the 2010/2011 Ocean Tomo

®

300 Patent Index  which recognizes companies with high intellectual property value. We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.  Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in
its proprietary technologies.


There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights
of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.

Regulations

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.  In accordance with Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver and cellular handset products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.  Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.  A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely
affect our business.    In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.

Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations.  The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provide that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.  Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise
and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.  Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.  Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.  The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between New Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.  The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review
and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.  A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.

Environmental Matters

Garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.  Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Currently, we do not anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Environmental regulation of Garmin’s products is increasing.  Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.  Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.  Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (“EMS”) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan manufacturing facility.


Regulatory and “Green Procurement” demands from our customers are also increasing, particularly in the areas of restricted substance use and environmentally-friendly design and manufacture initiatives.  The overall impacts of these customer requirements cannot yet be established.  Garmin is committed to improving our products and processes to meet our customer needs.

Employees

As of December 25, 2010, Garmin had 8,897 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom 3,470 were in the United States, 72 were in Canada, 4,419 were in Taiwan, 725 were in Europe, and 211 were in other global locations.   Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Brazil and Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Garmin considers its employee relations to be good.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Company

The demand for personal navigation devices (PNDs) may be eroded by replacement technologies becoming available on mobile handsets and factory-installed systems in new autos.

We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment which has resulted in GPS/navigation technologies being incorporated into competing devices such as mobile handsets and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.  Mobile handsets are frequently GPS-enabled and many companies are now offering navigation software for mobile devices.  The acceptance of this technology by consumers has halted our growth and could further reduce margins.  Navigation systems are also becoming more prevalent as optional equipment on new automobiles.  Increased
navigation penetration on new automobiles could cause further declines in sales of our portable navigation devices and further reduce margins.

Our financial results are highly dependent on the automotive/mobile segment, which represents approximately 62% of our revenues and is maturing.

We have historically experienced substantial growth in the automotive/mobile segment of our business as the products have become mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.  This market has peaked as penetration rates increase and competing technologies emerge.  This has resulted in lower revenues and lower earnings per share.

Economic conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and margins.

Our revenue and margins depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.  The current economic weakness and constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in decreased revenue and in the future, could result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailer and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.


Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Gross margins on our automotive/mobile products have been declining and are expected to decline in 2011 due to price reductions in the increasingly competitive market for personal navigation devices (PNDs) that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.  In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life.  To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacture of
existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Changes in our United States federal income tax classification or in applicable tax law could result in adverse tax consequences to our shareholders.

We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a ‘‘passive foreign investment company’’ for United States federal income tax purposes.  We do not expect to become a passive foreign investment company.  However, because the passive foreign investment company determination is made annually based on whether the company’s income or assets meet certain thresholds as determined under United States federal tax principles which are based on facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control, we cannot assure that we will not become a passive foreign investment company in the future.  If we are a passive foreign investment company in
any year, then any of our shareholders that is a United States person could be liable to pay tax on their pro rata share of our income plus an interest charge upon some distributions by us or when that shareholder sells our common shares at a gain.  Further, if we are classified as a passive foreign investment company in any year in which a United States person is a shareholder, we generally will continue to be treated as a passive foreign investment company with respect to such shareholder in all succeeding years, regardless of whether we continue to satisfy the income or asset tests mentioned above.

We do not believe that we (or any of our non-United States subsidiaries) are currently a Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) for United States federal income tax purposes.  We do not expect to become a CFC.  The CFC determination is made daily based on whether the United States shareholders own more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company.  Only United States persons that own ten percent or more of the voting power of the Company’s shares qualify as United States shareholders.  If the Company were to be classified as a CFC for an uninterrupted thirty day period in any year, the Company’s shareholders that qualify as United States
shareholders could be liable to pay US income tax at ordinary income tax rates on their pro-rata share of certain categories of the Company’s income for the period in which the Company is classified as a CFC. As the Company cannot control the ownership of the Company’s stock nor can the Company control which shareholders participate in the Company’s stock buyback program, ownership changes could result that create United States shareholders which increase the risk of Garmin being treated as a CFC.

Legislative proposals have been considered in the United States within the past year that could increase the United States tax burden of corporations with international operations and could broaden the circumstances under which foreign corporations could be considered resident in the United States   Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in United States or foreign tax laws, tax treaties or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.


If we are not successful in the continued development, introduction or timely manufacture of new products, demand for our products could decrease.

We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products.  The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs.  If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.  We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such
products.  However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.  We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change.  These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.  Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no
assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.  The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.  From time to time we have experienced delays in shipping certain of our new products and any future delays, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.  They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.  Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because we sell a majority of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.  In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.  If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.

Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.  If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.  If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.


Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.  If such operating results decline, the price of our stock would likely decline.  As we expand our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our advertising and research and development costs, may increase as a percentage of our sales.  If revenues decrease and we are unable to reduce those costs rapidly, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically, our revenues have been weaker in the first quarter of each fiscal year and have recently been lower than the preceding fourth quarter.  Our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in these quarters.  Sales of certain of our marine and automotive

products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products during the recreational marine, fishing, and travel season.  Sales of our automotive/mobile products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices
during the holiday season.

In addition, we attempt to time our new product releases to coincide with relatively higher consumer spending in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, which contributes to these seasonal variations.

Our quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.  We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.  The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

The currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.  Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.  The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.  In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

Nonetheless, U.S. GAAP requires the Company at the end of each accounting period to translate into Taiwan Dollars all such U.S. Dollar denominated assets held by our Taiwan subsidiary.  This translation is required because the Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of the subsidiary.  This U.S. GAAP-mandated translation will cause us to recognize gain or loss on our financial statements as the Taiwan Dollar/U.S. Dollar exchange rate varies.  Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.  Because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on
the Company’s operating performance before the impact of the foreign currency translation.

If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.

We have generally been able to increase production to meet this increasing demand.  However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and will be difficult to forecast.  We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support multiple products, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature to the mass market category.  Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:

·

If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.


·

Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.  These higher costs could lower our profit margins.  Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.

·

If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess production resulting in higher inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.  Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.

We have benefited in the past from Taiwan government tax incentives offered on certain high technology capital investments that may not always be available.

Our effective tax rate is lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, in part because we have benefited from incentives offered in Taiwan related to our high technology investments in Taiwan.  The loss of these tax benefits could have a significant effect on our financial results in the future.

We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Relations between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.  Our principal manufacturing facilities where we manufacture all of our products, except our panel-mounted aviation products, are located in Taiwan.

Taiwan has a unique international political status.  The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands and all of mainland China.  The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.  Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.  Relations between Taiwan and the PRC have on occasion adversely affected the market value of Taiwanese companies and could negatively affect
our operations in Taiwan in the future.

Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon other’s rights or are infringed upon by others.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.  However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.  Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of
reasons.   Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.

Third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.  Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights.  Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.  We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.  We might not have sufficient resources to pay for the licenses.  Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities
and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.


We may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If our aviation products malfunction or contain errors or defects, airplane collisions or crashes could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.  Malfunctions or errors or defects in our marine navigational products could cause boats to run aground or cause other wreckage, personal injury or death.  If our automotive or marine products contain defects or errors in the mapping supplied by third-party map providers or if our users do not heed our warnings about the proper use of these products, collisions or accidents could occur resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.  If any of these events occurs, we could be subject to significant liability for
personal injury and property damage and under certain circumstances could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.  We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.  However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  In addition, insurance coverage generally will not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.  If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for specific components, and our production would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.

We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.  Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.  The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.  Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.  Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source
components.

In the past we have experienced shortages of liquid crystal displays and other components.  In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, or if the costs of components rise, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.

We depend on third party licensors for the digital map data contained in our automotive/mobile products, and our business and/or gross margins could be harmed if we become unable to continue licensing such mapping data or if the royalty costs for such data rise.

We license digital mapping data for use in our products from various sources.  There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for each geographical region.  The two largest digital map suppliers are NAVTEQ Corporation and Tele Atlas N.V.  NAVTEQ Corporation is owned by Nokia Oyj and Tele Atlas N.V. is owned by TomTom N.V.  Nokia and TomTom are both competitors of Garmin.

Although we do not foresee difficulty in continuing to license data at favorable pricing due to the long term license extension signed between Garmin and NAVTEQ in November 2007 (extending our NAVTEQ license agreement through 2017 with an option to extend through 2021), if we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the nature of our relationships with NAVTEQ changes detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.


We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, complete and integrate such transactions.

We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.  We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.

Any past or future acquisitions could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees (including cultural differences with foreign acquisitions), operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.  Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.  We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other corporate governance matters, operations, personnel or products related to
acquisitions we have made in previous years  or may make in the future.  If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income or cash flows in the period or periods for
which that determination is made.

Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis could harm our business.

We have certain products, especially in our aviation segment, that are subject to governmental and similar certifications before they can be sold.  For example, FAA certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type certificated aircraft.  To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.  An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes.  Therefore, such
inabilities or delays could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we cannot assure you that our certified products will not be decertified.  Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.  We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers.  We do not have key man life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.  The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.  Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.  For example, in some recent years there has been a
nationwide shortage of qualified electrical engineers and software engineers who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.  If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.


There is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.

We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.  As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.  In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.

A shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.

Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. to be grounded for several days.  In addition to this shut down of U.S. airspace, the general aviation industry was further impacted by the additional restrictions implemented by the FAA on those flights that fly utilizing Visual Flight Rules (VFR).  The FAA restricted VFR flight inside 30 enhanced Class B (a 20-25 mile radius around the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the USA) airspace areas.  The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) estimated that these restrictions affected approximately 41,800 general aviation aircraft
based at 282 airports inside the 30 enhanced Class B airspace areas.  The AOPA estimates that approximately 90% of all general aviation flights are conducted VFR, and that only 15% of general aviation pilots are current to fly utilizing Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).

The shutdown of U.S. airspace following September 11, 2001 caused reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facility to our distribution facility in Olathe, Kansas, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any future shut down of U.S. airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System.

The Global Positioning System is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.  The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.  The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.  These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However,
of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 12 years.

If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, unavailable or are not replaced, it would impair the current utility of our Global Positioning System products and would have a material negative effect on our business.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the U.S. government will remain committed to the operation and maintenance of Global Positioning System satellites over a long period, or that the policies of the U.S. government that provide for the use of the Global Positioning System without charge and without accuracy degradation will remain unchanged.  Because of the increasing commercial applications of the Global Positioning System, other U.S. government
agencies may become involved in the administration or the regulation of the use of Global Positioning System signals.    However, in a presidential policy statement issued in December 2004, the Bush administration indicated that the U.S. is committed to supporting and improving the Global Positioning System and will continue providing it free from direct user fees.

Some of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS).  WAAS is operated by the FAA. Any curtailment of the operating capability of WAAS could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.


Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.

Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm our business.

Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s Global Positioning System satellites.  The Global Positioning System operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also
has regulatory authority on how each band is used.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers. For example, the FCC is currently considering a proposal by a private party, LightSquared, to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the GPS bands for terrestrial broadband wireless operations in metropolitan areas throughout the United States.  If the FCC were to permit implementation of LightSquared’s proposal as is, terrestrial broadband wireless operations would
create harmful interference to GPS receivers within range of such operations.

Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by war or terrorism.

Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.

Climate change is receiving increasing attention worldwide.  Some scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

There are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in June 2009 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act that would phase-in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law. The U.S. Senate is considering one or more different bills, and it is uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol. These actions could increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for components used in the manufacture of our products and freight
costs.

Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Risks Relating to Our Shares

The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.

The market price of our common shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During 2010, the price of our common shares ranged from a low of $26.55 to a high of $39.94. A variety of factors could cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

·

announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete;

·

quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;

·

the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our  products;

·

general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates;

·

announcements of technological innovations;

·

new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

·

product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;

·

developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;

·

developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

·

research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers; and

·

any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products.

In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As of January 14, 2011, members and former members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, together with members of their families and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 44.80% of our outstanding common shares.  Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions.  This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.

On June 27, 2010 we completed the redomestication of the place of our incorporation from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the “Redomestication”).  As a result of increased shareholder approval requirements under Swiss law, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a Cayman Islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management.

Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by a shareholders’ meeting every two years. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law does not provide as much flexibility as Cayman Islands law in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares
either. For example, while the board of directors of a Cayman Islands company can authorize the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval, we will not be able to issue preferred stock without the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes represented and a majority of the par value of the shares represented at a general meeting of our shareholders. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our board of directors previously had authority under Cayman Islands law. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of our shareholders.


The par value of our shares is higher following the Redomestication.  As a result, we have less flexibility than we previously had as a Cayman Islands company with respect to certain aspects of capital management.

The par value of our shares is 10 Swiss francs per share, compared to a par value of $0.005 per share when we were a Cayman Islands company.  Under Swiss law, we may not issue shares below par value. In the event we need to raise equity capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the par value of the shares, we will be unable to issue shares. In addition, we will not be able to issue options under our benefits plans with an exercise price below the par value, which would limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements.

We are subject to various Swiss taxes following the Redomestication.

Although we do not expect Swiss taxes to materially affect our worldwide effective corporate tax rate, we are subject to additional corporate taxes in Switzerland following the Redomestication. Switzerland imposes a corporate federal income tax for holding companies at an effective tax rate of 7.83%, although we should be entitled to a “participation relief” that in most cases will effectively eliminate any Swiss taxation on the profits of our subsidiaries paid by them to us as dividends as well as on capital gains related to the sale of participations. We also are subject to a Swiss issuance stamp tax levied on our share issuances, other than in connection with qualifying restructurings, or increases
of our equity at a rate of 1% of the fair market value of the issuance or increase. In addition, we are subject to some other Swiss indirect taxes (e.g., VAT, Swiss issuance stamp tax on certain debt instruments and Swiss securities transfer stamp tax).

We may not be able to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting you to Swiss withholding tax.

If we are unable to make distributions, if any, through a reduction of par value or to pay dividends, if any, out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying
corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds). Payment of a capital distribution in the form of a par value reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value, that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future. In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or to pay a dividend out of qualifying capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.

Under Swiss tax law applicable until December 31, 2010, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction have been treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. On January 1, 2011, under Swiss laws the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to the qualifying capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax. We may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases, if any, similar to a "second trading line" on the Swiss Stock Exchange in which Swiss institutional investors buy shares on the open market and sell these shares
to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the Swiss withholding tax. However, if we are unable to use this process successfully, we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without subjecting you to Swiss withholding taxes.

action.

Garmin’s semiconductor chip suppliers are also named in the complaint and Garmin believes these suppliers have
indemnification obligations to defend Garmin in this matter.  Garmin is preparing to file its Answer asserting the ’405, ’353, ’109, ’857, ’858, and the ’494 patents are invalid and/or not infringed.  Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of this litigation would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, Garmin believes these claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this action.

From time to time Garmin is involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Board of Directors will make a recommendation closer to the payment date based on the Company’s cash balance, cash
requirements and cash flow generation.

The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 12, 2010, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $300 million of the Company’s shares as market and business conditions warrant.   This share repurchase authorization expires on December 31, 2011.  No shares were repurchased under the plan during the fourth quarter of 2010.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations focuses on and is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto), the description of our business, all as set forth in this Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed above in Item 1A.

As previously noted, the discussion set forth below, as well as other portions of this Form 10-K, contain statements concerning potential future events.  Readers can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of such verbs as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes” or similar verbs or conjugations of such verbs.  If any of our assumptions on which the statements are based prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise, our actual results could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward-looking statements.  The differences could be caused by a number of factors or combination of factors including, but not limited
to, those discussed above in Item 1A.  Readers are strongly encouraged to consider those factors when evaluating any such forward-looking statement.  We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.

Garmin’s fiscal year is a 52-53 week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year.  Fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 contained 52 weeks.  Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods.  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.  We operate in four business segments, which serve the marine, outdoor/fitness, automotive/mobile, and aviation markets.  Our segments offer products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors.  However, the nature of products and types of customers for the four segments can vary significantly.  As such, the segments are managed separately.  Our portable GPS receivers and accessories for marine,
recreation/fitness and automotive/mobile segments are sold primarily to retail outlets.  Our aviation products are portable and panel-mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to retail outlets and certain aircraft manufacturers.

Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.  Our sales have increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 11% since 2006 and our net income has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 3% since 2006.  The vast majority of this growth has been organic; only a very small amount of new revenue occurred as a result of the acquisition of Dynastream Innovations Inc. in 2006, Digital Cyclone, Inc. and the assets of Nautamatic Marine Systems, Inc. in 2007, eleven European distributors between 2007 and 2010, and MetriGear, Inc. in
2010.  These acquisitions had no significant impact on net income for those years.

Since our principal locations are in the United States, Taiwan and the U.K., we experience some foreign currency fluctuations in our operating results.  The table below provides a listing of our functional currency by subsidiary excluding the European subsidiaries that utilize the Euro.


Approximately 77% of sales by our European subsidiaries are now denominated in British Pounds Sterling or the Euro.  We experienced ($88.4) million, ($6.0) million, and ($35.3) million in foreign currency losses during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  The 2008 foreign currency loss includes a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of the Euro between the date we purchased shares in Tele Atlas N.V. in October 2007 and the tender of shares in February, March, and June 2008.  To date, we have not entered into hedging transactions related to any currency, and we do not currently plan to utilize hedging transactions in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Garmin’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon Garmin’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The presentation of these financial statements requires Garmin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, Garmin evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts,
inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.  Garmin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Revenue Recognition

Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of
software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.  The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

Garmin introduced nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 36-month life of the products.


For multiple-element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and (iii) best estimate
of the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.  In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.

In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMU) bundled in the original purchase price.  Similar to nüMaps Lifetime™ which was introduced in January 2009, this enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including LMU. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the LMU. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling
price method determined primarily using VSOE.   Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  Amounts allocated to the LMU are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.

In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including premium traffic. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the premium traffic service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.   Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  Amounts allocated to the premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.

In 2009, Garmin introduced the nüvi 1690, a premium PND with a built-in wireless module that lets customers access Garmin’s nüLink!™ service, which provides direct links to certain online information.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the nüLink service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.   Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and
the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  Amounts allocated to the nüLink services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month life of the service.

Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.   The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.   Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results.   These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued
for on a percentage of sales basis.   If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.


Garmin records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on Garmin’s historical experience.

Trade Accounts Receivable

We sell our products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extend credit based on our evaluation of the customer’s financial condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition. We carry our trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, our accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest. We monitor our exposure to losses on receivables and maintain allowances for potential losses or adjustments. We determine these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of our receivables; and (2) reviewing our high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances are written off when our internal collection
efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.

Warranties

Garmin’s products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to three years. Garmin accrues a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services.  Garmin’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions.  To the extent Garmin experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit.

Inventory

Garmin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.

Investments

Investments are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value, and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders’ equity.   Investment income is recorded when earned, and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold.   Fair value of investments in auction rate securities are determined using third party estimates which followed an income approach valuation methodology.  Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary.   If investments are determined to be impaired, a capital loss is recognized at the date of
determination.

Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment.   The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements.   The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments.    Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.  The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing
investment impairment.

Income Taxes

Garmin provides deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.    It is Garmin’s policy to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to an amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized.  While Garmin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event Garmin
were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made.  Likewise, should Garmin determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination is made.


In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations.  We recognize liabilities for tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.  If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense
would result.

Stock Based Compensation

Garmin awards stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance shares each year as part of Garmin’s compensation package for employees.  Employees with certain levels of responsibility within Garmin are eligible for stock options, SAR grants, RSU grants and/or performance shares but the granting of options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares is at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and is not a contractual obligation.

Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense could be impacted.

Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our global dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers.  Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion above. Our sales are largely of a consumer nature; therefore backlog levels are not necessarily indicative of our future sales results.  We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.

Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.  Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season, and in the fourth quarter, due to increased demand during the holiday buying season.  Our aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Cost of Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.  In 2010, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 160 basis points as the average selling price declines outpaced raw material price declines.  In addition, the deferral of high margin revenue and the related costs increased significantly as the product mix shifted toward products bundled with lifetime maps.  See Note 2 for further information.  This was partially offset by a positive refinement in the warranty reserve.  In 2009, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment increased 350 basis points as benefits from raw
material price declines and operating efficiencies exceeded the average selling price decline.  In 2008, gross margin for our automotive/mobile segment declined 310 basis points as the average selling price continued to decline and we experienced further shift in product mix to lower-margin product groups.  These impacts were somewhat offset by raw material price declines, most significantly flash memory.  Gross margins for the aviation, marine, and outdoor/fitness segments are more stable.  Our long-term gross margin targets are 65%, 55% and 55%, respectively, for these segments.


Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to utilize alternative lower cost components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to permit us to use these lower cost components.  We believe that because of our practice of performing the design, manufacture and marketing of our products in-house, our Sijhih, Jhongli, and Lin-Kou manufacturing plants in Taiwan, our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants have experienced relatively low costs of manufacturing.  In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.  Our manufacturing labor costs
historically have been lower in Taiwan than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.  In the past, prices of our devices sold into the automotive/mobile market have declined due to market pressures and introduction of new products sold at lower price points.  The average selling prices of our aviation, outdoor/fitness, and marine products have been stable due to product mix and the introduction of more advanced products sold at higher prices.  The effect of the sales price differences inherent within the mix of GPS-enabled products sold could have a significant impact on our gross profit.

Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses consist of costs for both media advertising and cooperative advertising with our retail partners.  As revenues grew in 2008, advertising expense also increased.  In 2009-2010, we reduced our advertising expense as revenues declined and the public became more aware of GPS technology.  The reduction did not have a negative impact on our market share.  We expect advertising costs to decrease in 2011 as revenues decline.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

·

salaries for sales and marketing personnel;

·

salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

·

marketing, and other brand building costs;

·

accounting and legal costs;

·

information systems and infrastructure costs;

·

travel and related costs; and

·

occupancy and other overhead costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2010 due to legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.  Due to the economic pressure on our consumer-oriented business, we decreased selling, general and administrative expenses in 2009.  As revenues grew in 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses increased.  We expect selling, general and administrative costs, excluding advertising, to be stable or decline slightly in 2011 as revenues decline.


Research and Development

The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers, costs for high technology components and costs of test equipment used in product and prototype development.  Approximately 87% of the research and development of our products is performed in North America.   The remainder of our research and development activities is performed primarily by our Taiwan engineering group.

We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for GPS-enabled devices.  We expect our research and development budget in absolute terms to be stable in 2011.

Customers

Our top ten customers have contributed between 34% and 36% of net sales since 2008.  We have experienced average sales days in our customer accounts receivable of between 70 and 78 days since 2008.  We have experienced an increase in the level of customer accounts receivable days due to changes in product mix, longer payment terms, and macroeconomic conditions.  We expect to reduce the level of customer accounts receivable days as we negotiate shorter payment terms with our customers.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively low effective corporate tax rate due to the proportion of our revenue generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.   In particular,  the profit entitlement afforded our Swiss-based companies based on their intellectual property rights ownership of our consumer products along with substantial tax incentives offered by the Taiwanese government on certain high-technology capital investments have continued to reduce our tax rate.  As a result, our consolidated effective tax rate was approximately (1.3%) during
2010.

The negative rate was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.  The one-time items of ($98.7) million include the release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.  Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 12.9% for 2009.

This increase resulted from an unfavorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates.  We have taken advantage of the tax benefit in Taiwan since our inception and we expect to continue to benefit from lower effective tax rates at least through
2015.

Management believes that due to lower operating margins predicted for fiscal 2011, there may be slightly less revenue recognized by entities in lower tax rate jurisdictions.  Therefore, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be higher than fiscal 2010.  The actual effective tax rate will be dependent upon the operating margins, production volume, additional capital investments made during fiscal 2011, and the composition of our earnings.

Net sales decreased 9% in 2010 when compared to the year-ago period.  The decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by revenue growth in outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation.  The outdoor/fitness segment experienced the greatest increase at 19%.  Automotive/mobile revenue remains the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 70% in 2009 to 62% in 2010.

Total unit sales decreased 4% to 16.0 million units in 2010 from 16.6 million units in 2009.   The declining unit sales volume in 2010 was attributable to a decline in automotive/mobile units due to increased saturation in the segment and competing technologies partially offset by increasing volumes in the outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation segments.

Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 19% in 2010, as the average selling price and volumes declined 11% and 9%, respectively.   Outdoor/fitness segment revenue increased 19% on the strength of recent product introductions that expand the addressable market and ongoing global penetration.  Marine revenues increased 12% due to product introductions, slight industry recovery and market share gains.  Aviation revenues increased 7% as the Company delivered into additional cockpits and the retrofit business began to recover.

The Company anticipates ongoing revenue declines in 2011 driven by the automotive/mobile segment with partially offsetting growth in the outdoor/fitness, aviation and marine segments.  In general, management believes that continuous innovation and the introduction of new products are essential for future revenue growth.

Cost of goods sold decreased 11% in 2010 when compared to the year-ago period which was generally consistent with the change in revenue.  The absolute dollar decrease occurred in automotive/mobile and was partially offset by cost of goods increases in outdoor/fitness, marine and aviation. Cost of goods sold in 2010 was positively impacted by 160 basis points due to a $42.8 million warranty adjustment related to refinement in the estimated warranty reserve.  This adjustment impacted all segments with automotive/mobile, outdoor/fitness and marine having the largest benefits.   Cost per unit declined in all segments driving stable to improving margins in outdoor/fitness, marine and
aviation.

Management believes that cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales will be stable in 2011 given current component pricing.

Gross profit dollars in 2010 decreased 7% while gross profit margin percentage increased 110 basis points compared to 2009.  Gross profit margins were stable to increasing in all segments excluding the automotive/mobile segment when compared to 2009.

The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage decrease of 160 basis points was driven by an 11% decrease in average selling price which was only partially offset by a decline in per unit costs including the warranty benefit.   Gross profit dollars of the automotive/mobile segment declined to 50% of total gross profit dollars from 60% in 2009.  Gross profit dollars for marine increased 18% compared to 2009 due to product mix shifting toward higher margin units.  Gross profit dollars for outdoor/fitness increased by 19% to $364.5 million due to strong revenue growth in the segment.

Management believes that total company gross margins will be stable in 2011 as growth occurs in segments with higher margin profiles offsetting continued margin pressure in the automotive/mobile segment due to price declines.

Advertising expense decreased 7% in absolute dollars and was flat as a percentage of revenues when compared to 2009.  As a percent of revenues, advertising expenses were 5% in both 2010 and 2009.  The absolute dollar decrease occurred primarily in the automotive/mobile segment due to reduced cooperative advertising paid to our retail partners partially offset by mobile handset specific advertising.  Further offsetting the decline was increased advertising for outdoor/fitness where we continue to invest for growth.

Management expects to maintain advertising as a percentage of sales constant in 2011.

Selling, general and administrative expense increased in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues compared to 2009.  As a percent of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 9% of revenues in 2009 to 11% of revenues in 2010. The expense increase was primarily driven by legal costs, fees associated with the Swiss redomestication, and growth in product support and information technology to support our growing installed base of users.  Aviation costs declined year-over-year due to a 2009 bad debt accrual driven by cash collection risks associated with several of our customers that did not reoccur in 2010.

Management expects selling, general and administrative expenses to decline in absolute dollars but to increase as a percentage of sales in 2011 as revenue declines outpace cost reductions.

Research and development expense increased 16% due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative which has now been cancelled, and the addition of over 350 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period.   In absolute dollars, research and development costs increased $38.9 million primarily in the auto/mobile segment, when compared with the year-ago period and increased 220 basis points as a percent of revenue.

Management believes that one of the key strategic initiatives for future growth and success of Garmin is continuous innovation, development, and introduction of new products.  Management expects that its research and development expenses will be stable during fiscal 2011 on an absolute dollar basis in order to deliver innovative new products and technologies.

Operating income decreased 300 basis points as a percent of revenue and 19% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period as gross margin percentage improvements and reduced advertising expense were more than offset by declining revenues and increased selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses.

The automotive/mobile operating margin declined from 22% in 2009 to 15% in 2010 due to a 160 basis point decline in gross margins and selling, general and administrative and research and development expense increases during a period of declining revenues.  The aviation operating margin increased from 24% in 2009 to 28% in 2010 as gross margins improved 100 basis points

Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.  Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal 2010 relative to fiscal 2009, with the majority of this difference caused by a large foreign currency loss in 2010.  Interest income for fiscal 2010 increased due to increasing cash and marketable securities balances during the year partially offset by decreasing interest rates.

Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are primarily tied to movements by the Taiwan Dollar, the Euro, and the British Pound Sterling.   Due to the relative size of entities using other currencies, movements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.  The Euro is the functional currency of all subsidiaries excluding those shown below.  As subsidiaries have grown, currency moves generated material gains and losses.   Additionally, Euro-based inter-company transactions in Garmin Ltd. can also generate currency gains and losses.

The $88.4 million currency loss in 2010 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, as well as the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Taiwan Dollar.  During 2010, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 8.8% and 3.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a loss of $51.0 million.  A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.  The movements of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs and cash held in non-functional currency while the Euro and
British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue. The remaining net currency gain of $1.3 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $6.0 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan Dollar.  During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of $5.8 million.  A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.   The remaining net currency gain of $4.3 million related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

Income Tax Provision

Our earnings before taxes fell 29% when compared to 2009 and our income tax expense decreased by $112.0 million, to ($7.3) million, for fiscal year 2010 from $104.7 million for fiscal year 2009.  The significant decline in income tax expense was due to the impact of one-time items booked in 2010.  The one-time items of ($98.7) million include release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US, partially offset by the amount of the settlement for the 2007 tax year in the US and Taiwan surtax expense due to the release of reserves.  Without one-time items, we would have reported an effective tax rate of 15.8% for 2010 compared to 12.9%
for 2009.  The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate as compared to 2009 is largely due to an unfavorable mix of income among taxing jurisdictions.

Net Income

As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 17% to $584.6 million for fiscal year 2010 compared to $704.0 million for fiscal year 2009.

Net sales decreased 16% in 2009 when compared to the year-ago period.  The decrease occurred across all segments, except outdoor/fitness, with the greatest decreases in the automotive/mobile and aviation segments.  Automotive/mobile revenue was the largest portion of our revenue mix, but declined from 73% in 2008 to 70% in 2009.

Total unit sales decreased 2% to 16.6 million in 2009 from 16.9 million in 2008.  The lower unit sales volume was attributable to declining volumes across all segments, excluding outdoor/fitness, with the greatest percentage declines occurring in aviation and marine.  The lower volumes were driven primarily by the macroeconomic conditions and reduced inventory levels with many of our retail partners.

Automotive/mobile segment revenue declined 19% in 2009 as the average selling price declined 18% and volumes declined 2%.  Average selling price declines continue to be attributable to the competitive environment in which our automotive/mobile products compete.  The aviation and marine segments declined 24% and 13%, respectively in 2009, as both industries experienced significant slowdowns associated with the macroeconomic conditions.  Outdoor/fitness segment revenue increased 10% due to new product introductions, including the Dakota™ series, the Forerunner® 405CX, the Forerunner® 310XT and Edge® 500, and increasing global penetration of the fitness
category.  All segments showed improving trends in the second half of 2009 as the macroeconomic conditions improved.

Cost of goods sold decreased 23% in 2009 when compared to 2008 due primarily to the 16% decline in revenue.  In addition, cost per unit declined in all segments driving cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue lower due to material cost reductions.  This savings was partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiatives.

The decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the automotive/mobile and aviation segments where the effects of revenue declines were partially offset by the improved gross margins earned.  Gross profit margin percentage for the Company overall increased 450 basis points as margins expanded in all segments.

The automotive/mobile segment gross profit margin percentage increase of 350 basis points was driven by material costs reductions partially offset by inventory reserves associated with the mobile handset initiative and price declines.  Outdoor/fitness gross margin increased principally due to a newer suite of higher margin products.  Gross profit margin percentage for marine and aviation increased compared to 2008 due to increased average selling price and decreases in per unit costs driven by product mix and material cost reductions.

Advertising expense decreased both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars when compared to 2008.  As a percent of sales, advertising expenses declined to 5% in 2009 compared to 6.0% in 2008.  The decrease was a result of actions taken by the company to reduce costs as the macroeconomic conditions impacted sales across our segments and around the world combined with lower cooperative advertising which is tied to net sales levels.

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 5% in 2009 while it increased as a percentage of sales compared to 2008 as costs throughout the Company were reduced but not as rapidly as the revenue declines.  The decline in costs was primarily related to a reduction in bad debt expense due to specific reserves recorded in 2008 as a result of vendor bankruptcies offset by increased costs for product support and information technology.  The increased expense for the outdoor/fitness segment and the decreased expense for the automotive/mobile segment were driven by the allocation of costs based on revenues.  As outdoor/fitness
revenues have increased as a percentage of revenues, additional selling, general and administrative expenses are shifted to the segment.  As a percent of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased from 8% in 2008 to 9% of sales in 2009, as revenues declined.

The increase in research and development expense dollars was due to ongoing development activities for new products including the mobile handset initiative, the addition of 230 new engineering personnel to our staff during the period, and an increase in engineering program costs in 2009 as a result of our continued emphasis on product innovation.

Other income (expense) principally consists of interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses.  Other income (expense) was lower in fiscal 2009 relative to fiscal 2008, with the majority of this difference caused by a large gain on sale of equity securities in 2008.  Interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased due to lower interest rates, partially offset by higher cash and marketable securities balances.

The $6.0 million currency loss in 2009 was due to the weakening of the U.S. Dollar compared to the Euro, the British Pound Sterling and the Taiwan Dollar.  During 2009, the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.4% and 8.3% compared to the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, respectively, resulting in a gain of $5.8 million.  A loss of $16.1 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 2.3% against the Taiwan Dollar.  The relative weakness of the Taiwan Dollar and Euro/British Pound Sterling have offsetting impacts due to the use of the Taiwan Dollar for manufacturing costs while the Euro and British Pound Sterling transactions relate to revenue. The remaining net currency gain of $4.3 million
related to other currencies and timing of transactions.

The $35.3 million currency loss in 2008 was related to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar offset by a gain associated with the sales and tender of our Tele Atlas N.V. shares.  During 2008, the Taiwan Dollar weakened 1.6% in comparison to the U.S. Dollar, resulting in a $20.8 million gain.  The Euro weakened 4.1% and the British Pound Sterling weakened 26.1% relative to the U.S. Dollar in 2008 which resulted in a $77.3 million loss.  Offsetting this net loss was a realized gain of $21.5 million due to the strengthening of the Euro between the date of purchase of the Tele Atlas N.V. shares in October 2007 to the dates of tender in February, March, and June 2008.  Other net
currency losses and the timing of transactions created the remaining loss of $0.3 million.

Gain on sale of equity of securities of $50.9 million in 2008 was primarily generated from the sale of our equity interest in Tele Atlas N.V. which we acquired in 2007 in connection with our announced intent to make a cash offer for all outstanding shares, which was subsequently abandoned.


Income Tax Provision

Our fiscal 2009 earnings before taxes fell 12% when compared to 2008, while our income tax expense decreased 42%.  Income taxes fell $76.8 million, to $104.7 million, for fiscal year 2009 from $181.5 million for fiscal year 2008, due to a lower effective tax rate and the reduced earnings before taxes.  The effective tax rate was 12.9% for fiscal 2009 compared to 19.9% for fiscal 2008.  The decrease in tax rate is due to the favorable mix of taxable income among the tax jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the release of income tax reserves for which the statute of limitations has expired.

Net Income

As a result of the various factors noted above, net income decreased 4% to $704.0 million for fiscal year 2009 compared to $732.8 million for fiscal year 2008.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash generated by operations was $770.6 million, $1,094.5 million, and $862.2 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.  Primary drivers of the cash generation in 2010 included $584.6 million of net income with non-cash adjustments for depreciation/amortization of $94.7 million, foreign currency unrealized losses of $62.8 million, stock compensation expense of $40.3 million, $129.7 million related to decreased accounts receivable as sales levels have declined and $131.3 million of sales for which cash was received but revenue was deferred as required by our revenue recognition policies.  This cash generation was partially offset by uses of cash including a $144.5 million
reduction in other current and noncurrent liabilities related primarily to the timing of royalty payments and the $146.4 million reversal of tax reserves associated with both release of uncertain tax position reserves from 2006 to 2008 related to our settlement with the IRS in the US and expiration of statute of limitations, a $81.4 million reduction in accounts payable primarily in our Taiwan manufacturing operations due to timing of payments, and a $77.1 million increase in inventories following a low inventory level exiting 2009.  The decline in cash flow from operations over 2009 levels was due to reduced net income levels and the effect of the non cash income tax benefit realized from reduced tax reserves. We expect to generate cash flow from operations in 2011 with ongoing net income, as well as working capital gains through reduced accounts receivable and inventory
levels as sales decline.

Cash flow used in investing activities was $72.9 million, $547.9 million and $56.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Cash flow used in investing activities principally relates to the net redemption of or investment in fixed income securities, capital expenditures and acquisitions.  Capital expenditures in 2010 totaled $32.2 million and related to business operations and maintenance activities.  This has declined significantly from 2008 spending levels due to the completion of production and warehouse facility expansions.  We have budgeted approximately $50 million of capital expenditures during fiscal 2011
to include normal ongoing capital expenditures and maintenance activities.  In 2010 and 2009, net investment in fixed income securities of our on-hand cash was $25.5 million and $491.0 million, respectively, as we invested excess cash.   In 2008, the net sale of fixed income securities was primarily related to $239.3 million of cash generated from the tender of our shares of Tele Atlas N.V.  It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash consistent with Garmin’s investment policy, which has been approved by the Board of Directors.  The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.  Garmin’s average interest rate returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
approximately 1.3%, 1.7% and 3.4%, respectively.    In 2010, cash flow used in investing activities also included the acquisition of MetriGear, Inc.  In 2008, cash flow used in investing for acquisitions related to the purchase of European distributors.

Net cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2010 was $510.8 million resulting from the use of $298.9 million for payment of our declared dividend and $225.9 million for stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan, partially offset by $14.0 million from the issuance of common stock related to our Company stock option plan and stock based compensation tax benefits.  The 2010 dividend paid was significantly higher than prior years as the dividend was increased to $1.50 per share.  Stock repurchases are made at the discretion of management under repurchase programs approved by the Board of Directors as business and market conditions warrant.  In 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company
repurchased 7.4 million shares, 0.7 million shares and 17.1 million shares, respectively.


We currently use cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures, to support our working capital requirements, to pay dividends and to repurchase shares.  We expect that future cash requirements will principally be for capital expenditures, working capital, repurchase of shares, payment of dividends declared, and the funding of strategic acquisitions.

We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements at least through the end of fiscal 2011.

We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.  However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.  Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $153.6 million as of December 25, 2010, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2, “Income Taxes”, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials.  Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions.  Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.


Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases.  Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.  We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar.  The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations.

The currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.  Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Sijhih, Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency.  The Company translates all assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates and income and expense accounts at average rates during the year.  In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in marketable securities denominated in U.S. dollars.

All European subsidiaries excluding Garmin (Europe) Ltd., Garmin Danmark, Garmin Sweden, Garmin Polska and Garmin Norge use the Euro as the functional currency

.

The functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd. remains the U.S. dollar, and as some transactions occurred in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  The Company believes that gains and losses will become more material in the future as our European presence grows.  In 2010, the U.S. Dollar strengthened
8.8% relative to the Euro and 3.3% relative to the British Pound Sterling.   These currency moves resulted in a foreign currency loss of $51.0 million in Garmin Ltd. and our European subsidiaries.  A loss of $38.7 million resulted due to the U.S. Dollar weakening 5.9% against the Taiwan Dollar.  The net result of these currency moves combined with other gains of $1.3 million, and the timing of transactions during the year was a net loss of $88.4 million for the Company and a cumulative translation adjustment of $61.7 million at the end of fiscal 2010.

Interest Rate Risk

We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 25, 2010.   We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.   As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.  A hypothetical change of 10% in interest rates would not have a material effect on such unrealized gains or losses.  At December 25, 2010, cumulative unrealized losses on those securities were $4.6 million.

Report of Ernst & Young LLP

Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin Ltd.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010.  Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a)(2).  These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

GARMIN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Information)

December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009

1. Description of the Business

Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) manufacture, market, and distribute Global Positioning System-enabled products and other related products.   Garmin Corporation (GC), wholly-owned by Garmin Ltd., is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to Garmin International, Inc. (GII), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GC, and Garmin (Europe) Limited (GEL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Garmin Ltd., and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Asia and the Far East.  GII is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in many
international markets and in the United States as well as research and new product development. GII also manufactures certain products for the Company’s aviation segment.   GEL is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products, principally within the European market.

2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Fiscal Year

The Company has adopted a 52–53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.

In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial results of those fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarter, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated quarters having only 13 weeks.   Fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008 included 52 weeks.

Foreign Currency Translation

Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency.  As required by the

Foreign Currency Matters

topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities. The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate
component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative translation adjustments of $61,740 and $9,231 as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.


Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All differences are recorded in results of operations and amounted to exchange gains/(losses) of ($88,377), ($6,040), and ($35,286) for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.  The loss in fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of the strengthening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling and the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar.  The loss in fiscal 2009 was primarily the
result of the weakening of the USD against the Taiwan Dollar offset by the weakening of the USD against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling.  The loss in fiscal 2008 was the result of the strengthening of the USD offset by a gain associated with the sale and tender of our Tele Atlas N.V. shares.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive stock options has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise at the average market price of the Company’s stock during the period the options were outstanding. See Note 10.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments.

Trade Accounts Receivable

The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition. The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest. The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments. The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers. Past due receivable balances
are written off when its internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted-average method (which approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method) by GC and the FIFO method by GII, GAT and GEL.   Inventories consisted of the following:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:


Long-Lived Assets

As required by the

Property, Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.  An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair
value.

The

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

topic of the FASB ASC requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company did not recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in 2010, 2009, or 2008. The Company established reporting units based on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit.  The
accounting guidance also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment. The Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging from 3 to 10 years.

Dividends

On March 16, 2010 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on April 30, 2010 to shareholders of record on April 15, 2010.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $298,853.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On July 30, 2009 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be paid on December 15, 2009 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2009.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $149,846.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On June 6, 2008 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.75 per share to be paid on December 15, 2008 to shareholders of record on December 1, 2008.  The Company paid out a dividend in the amount of $150,251.  The dividend has been reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately $213,486 and $199,549 of retained earnings are indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.

Intangible Assets

At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, the Company had patents, license agreements, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $152,138 and $165,021, respectively.  The Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $136,548 at December 25, 2010 and $129,066 at December 26, 2009.

Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over three to ten years.  Accumulated amortization was $103,534 and $80,428 at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 respectively.  Amortization expense was $36,675, $37,444, and $30,874, for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.  In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $24,889, $10,584, $4,612, $2,482, and $2,317, respectively.


Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.

All of the Company’s marketable securities are considered available-for-sale at December 25, 2010. See Note 3.  Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in other comprehensive gain/(loss).  At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, cumulative unrealized gains/(losses) of ($5,736) and ($22,613), respectively, were reported in accumulated other comprehensive gain/(loss), net of related taxes.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest income from investments. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in other income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC topic

Income Taxes

. The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Income taxes of $233,028 and $171,097 at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its subsidiaries because such earnings are
intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.

The Company adopted the applicable guidance included in the FASB ASC topic

Income Taxes

related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on December 31, 2006, the beginning of fiscal year 2007.   The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2010 was $153,621 including interest of $9,580.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for years ending December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 is as follows:

Balance at end of year

$

153,621

$

255,748

The December 25, 2010 balance of $153,621 of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.

Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as non-current liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.  The entire $153,621 and $255,748 are required to be classified as non-current at December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively.


Interest expense and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.  At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, the Company had accrued approximately $9,580 and $20,160 respectively for interest.   Interest expense included in income tax expense for the years ending December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 are ($10,580) and $9,000, respectively.  The Company had no amounts accrued for penalties as the nature of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would not warrant the imposition of penalties.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.  The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2007.  The Company is no longer subject to Taiwan income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2005.  The Company is no longer subject to United Kingdom tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2008.

The Company also considers 2007 and 2008 US federal returns to have been effectively settled due to completion of an audit examination by the Internal Revenue Service.  A reduction of income tax expense of ($122,314) was recognized to reflect this settlement.  In addition, the Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $24,066 and $19,771 in fiscal years ended December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $14,069 million of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statute of limitations.  This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements. Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers. Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management’s expectations.   Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.   Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.

Revenue Recognition

Garmin recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable.  For the large majority of Garmin’s sales, these criteria are met once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for standalone sales of software products and sales of
software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.  The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

Garmin introduced nüMaps Lifetime™ in January 2009, which is a single fee program that, subject to the program’s terms and conditions, enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties for sales of nüMaps Lifetime™ products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 36-month life of the products.


For multiple element arrangements that include tangible products that contain software that is essential to the tangible product’s functionality and undelivered software elements that relate to the tangible product’s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“TPE”), and
(iii) best estimate of the selling price (“ESP”).  VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable.   In addition to the products listed below, the Company has offered certain other products that involve multiple-element arrangements that are immaterial.

In 2010, Garmin began offering PNDs with lifetime map updates (LMU) bundled in the original purchase price.  Similar to nüMaps Lifetime™ which was introduced in January 2009, this enables customers to download the latest map and point of interest information every quarter for the useful life of their PND.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including LMU. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the LMU. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling
price method determined primarily using VSOE.   Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The revenue and associated cost of royalties allocated to the LMU are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.

In addition, Garmin offers PNDs with premium traffic bundled in the original purchase price in the European market.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of PNDs including premium traffic. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the premium traffic service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.   Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other
conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The revenue and associated cost allocated to the premium traffic service are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated 36-month life of the products.

In 2009 and 2010 respectively, Garmin introduced the nüvi 1690 and 1695, premium PNDs with a built-in wireless module that lets customers access Garmin’s nüLink!™ service, which provides direct links to certain online information.  The Company has identified two deliverables contained in arrangements involving the sale of the nüvi 1690 and 1695. The first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale, and the second deliverable is the nüLink service. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method determined using VSOE.   Amounts
allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met.  The revenue and associated cost allocated to the nüLink services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month life of the service.

Garmin records estimated reductions to revenue for customer sales programs returns and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions and other volume-based incentives.   The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.   Changes in these estimates could negatively affect Garmin’s operating results.   These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, are accrued
for on a percentage of sales basis.   If market conditions were to decline, Garmin may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered.


The Company records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company’s historical experience.

Deferred Revenues and Costs

At December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $197,787 and $66,484, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $44,738 and $13,310, respectively.

The deferred revenues and costs are recognized over their estimated economic lives of two to three years on a straight-line basis.  In the next three years, the gross margin recognition of deferred revenue and cost for the currently deferred amounts is estimated to be $69,623, $56,617, and $26,809, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Product Warranty

The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale. The warranty period is generally for one year from date of shipment with the exception of certain aviation products for which the warranty period is two years from the date of installation and certain marine products for which the warranty period is three years from the date of shipment

.

Sales Programs

The Company provides certain monthly and quarterly incentives for its dealers and distributors based on various factors including dealer purchasing volume and growth. Additionally, from time to time, the Company provides rebates to end users on certain products. Estimated rebates and incentives payable to dealers and distributors are regularly reviewed and recorded as accrued expenses on a monthly basis.   In addition, the Company provides dealers and distributors with product discounts to assist these customers in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases. Each discount is tied to a specific product and can be applied to all customers who have purchased the
product or a special discount may be agreed to on an individual customer basis.  These rebates, incentives, and discounts are recorded as reductions to net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of income in the period the Company has sold the product.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $144,613, $155,521, and $208,177 for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.

Research and Development

A majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $277,261, $238,378, and $206,109 for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, respectively.


Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through Web sites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. The technical support is provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. The related cost of providing this free support is not material.

Software Development Costs

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Software

requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Our capitalized software development costs are not significant as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short. As required by the

Research and Development

topic of the FASB ASC, costs we incur to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the
period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently sponsors three stock based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled

Compensation – Stock Compensation

requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values. See Note 9.

Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management’s estimates.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-06, "Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements" ("ASU 2010-06"), which is included in the ASC Topic 820 (Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures). ASU 2010-06 requires new disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements.  ASU 2010-06 also requires disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the Level 3 fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques.  Except as otherwise provided, ASU 2010-06 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

In February 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-09, "Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements" ("ASU 2010-09"), which is included in ASC Topic 855 (Subsequent Events).  ASU 2010-09 clarifies that an SEC filer is required to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued.  ASU 2010-09 was effective upon the issuance of the final update and did not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.


3. Marketable Securities

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).  The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liability

Level 2

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or

unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets

Level 3

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value.  Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs, an independent third party provided the valuation.  The inputs used in the valuations used the following methodology.  The collateral composition was used to estimate Weighted Average Life based on historical and projected payment information.  Cash flows were projected for the issuing trusts, taking into account underlying loan principal, bonds outstanding, and payout formulas.  Taking this information into account, assumptions were made as to the yields likely to be required, based upon then current market conditions for comparable or similar term Asset Based
Securities as well as other fixed income securities.

Assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

All Level 3 investments have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or longer.  However, it is the Company’s intent to hold these securities until they recover their value.  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the period, the accounting guidance requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances, separately for each major category of assets.  The reconciliation is as follows:

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

The unrealized losses on the Company’s investments in 2009 and 2010 were caused primarily by changes in interest rates, specifically, widening credit spreads.  The Company’s investment policy requires investments to be rated A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.  The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity.  Therefore, the Company considers the declines to be temporary in nature.  Fair values were
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.  When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value.  During 2009 and 2010, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.


The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at December 25, 2010, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, actions, and complaints, including matters involving patent infringement and other intellectual property claims and various other risks.  It is not possible to predict with certainty whether or not the Company and its subsidiaries will ultimately be successful in any of these legal matters, or if not, what the impact might be.   However, the Company’s management does not expect that the results in any of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


5.  Employee Benefit Plans

GII sponsors a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which its employees may contribute up to 50% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which GII contributes a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the Plan.  Additionally, GEL has a defined contribution plan under which its employees may contribute up to 7.5% of their annual compensation. Both GII and GEL contribute an amount determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors. During the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, expense related to these plans of $17,952, $16,399,
and $14,927 was charged to operations.

Certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries participate in local defined benefit pension plans.  Contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries.  Neither obligations nor contributions for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008, were significant.

At December 25, 2010, the Company had $48,784 million of tax credit carryover which includes $46,234 of Taiwan surtax credit with no expiration.  There is a full valuation allowance for the Taiwan surtax credits.  Additionally, the Company had $479 in Taiwan investment credit which will expire in 2012.  The valuation allowance increased by $15,735 during 2010 including $12,109 related to Taiwan surtax credits.

7.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As required by the

Financial Instruments

topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes. The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:


For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

8.  Segment Information

The Company operates within its targeted markets through four reportable segments, those being related to products sold into the marine, automotive/mobile, outdoor/fitness, and aviation markets. For external reporting purposes, we aggregate operating segments which have similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers and distribution methods into reportable segments.  All of the Company’s reportable segments offer products through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEM’s.  However, the nature of products and types of customers for the
four reportable segments vary significantly. The Company’s marine, automotive/mobile, and outdoor/fitness segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold primarily to retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan.  The Company’s aviation products are portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM evaluates performance and allocates resources based on income before income taxes of each segment.

Income before income taxes represents net sales less operating expenses including certain allocated general and administrative costs, interest income and expense, foreign currency adjustments, and other non-operating corporate expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The identifiable assets associated with each reportable segment reviewed by the CODM include accounts receivable and inventories. The Company does not report property and equipment, intangible assets, depreciation and amortization, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

Revenues, interest income and interest expense, income before income taxes, and identifiable assets for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented below:

9. Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.  For all Stock Compensation Plans, the company’s policy is to issue Treasury Shares or purchase shares on the open market for option/SAR exercises, RSU releases and ESPP purchases.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan

In June 2005, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2005 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 10,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.   During 2010, 2009, and 2008, the Company granted 0, 0,
and 1,454,050 stock appreciation rights, respectively.  During 2010, 2009, and 2008, 494,995, 470,950, and 1,043,800 restricted stock units were granted under the 2005 Plan.  In 2010, 2009, and 2008, 20,000, 30,000, and 0 performance shares were also granted under the 2005 Plan.


2000 Equity Incentive Plan

In October 2000, the shareholders adopted an equity incentive plan (the “2000 Plan”) providing for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and/or performance shares to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to which up to 7,000,000 common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and stock appreciation rights vest evenly over a period of five years or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire ten years from the date of grant, if not exercised.   The Company did not grant any stock awards from the
2000 Plan in 2010, 2009 or 2008.

2000 Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

Also in October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the Directors Plan) providing for grants of options for up to 100,000 common shares. The term of each award is ten years. All awards vest evenly over a three-year period. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, options to purchase 23,924, 34,648, and 15,696 shares, respectively, were granted under this plan. In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional 150,000 shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan 250,000.

Stock-Based Compensation Activity

A summary of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2005 Equity Incentive Plan, the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2000 Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan for the years ended December 25, 2010, December 26, 2009, and December 27, 2008 is provided below:


The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 25, 2010 is 5.55 and 5.14 years, respectively.  The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 25, 2010 was 2.39 years.

The fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for 2010, 2009, and 2008:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management’s opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.  The weighted-average
fair value for all awards granted during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $29.09, $29.20, and $37.96, respectively.

The total fair value of awards vested during 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $41,249, $41,527, and $35,384, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 25, 2010 were $21,723 and $21,563, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs exercised during the year ended December 25, 2010 was $12,259.  The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 25, 2010 was $45,645.  The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs released during the year ended December 25, 2010 was $8,828.  Aggregate intrinsic value represents the positive difference between the Company’s closing stock price on the last
trading day of the fiscal period, which was $30.36 on December 25, 2010, and the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised. As of December 25, 2010, there was $83,559 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining contractual term.


Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The shareholders also adopted an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP with shareholders approving an additional 2,000,000 shares in May 2010. Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or 85% of the fair market value on the enrollment date. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  During 2010, 2009, and 2008, 349,173, 209,416, and 362,902 shares, respectively were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $8,134, $3,874, and $8,782,
respectively.   During 2010, the purchases were made on the open market.  At December 25, 2010, approximately 2,075,284 shares were available for future issuance.

11.  Share Repurchase Program

The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 12, 2010, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300,000 of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant on the open market or in negotiated transactions in compliance with the SEC’s Rule 10b-18.   The share repurchase authorization expires on December 31, 2011.   As of December 25, 2010, the Company had repurchased 7,366,646 shares using cash of $223,149.  There remains approximately $76,851 available for repurchase under this authorization.

The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on October 22, 2008, authorizing the Company to purchase up to $300 million of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2009.   From inception to expiration, $60 million of common shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.


The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on June 6, 2008, authorizing the Company to purchase up to 10,000,000 of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2009.   During fiscal 2008, 10,000,000 shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.

The Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program on February 4, 2008, authorizing the Company to purchase up to 5,000,000 of its common shares as market and business conditions warrant.   The share repurchase authorization expired on December 31, 2009.   During fiscal 2008, 5,000,000 shares were repurchased and retired under this plan.

12.  Redomestication

The redomestication effectively changed the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of Garmin from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland.

The redomestication involved several steps. On February 9, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) formed Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) as a direct subsidiary. On April 6, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) petitioned the Cayman Court to order, among other things, the calling of a meeting of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) common shareholders to approve a scheme of arrangement. On April 7, 2010, the Cayman Court ordered us to seek shareholder approval of the scheme of arrangement. On May 20, 2010 we obtained the necessary shareholder approval.  On June 4, 2010, a hearing was held by the Cayman Court and at which hearing the Cayman Court was asked to and did approve the scheme of arrangement.  The scheme of arrangement
became effective at 3:00 a.m., Cayman Islands time, on Sunday, June 27, 2010 (the “Transaction Time”).

At and shortly following the Transaction Time, the following steps occurred:

1.

all issued and outstanding Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) common shares were transferred to Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland); and

2.

in consideration, Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) (a) issued registered shares (on a one-for-one basis) to the holders of the Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) common shares that were transferred to Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland), and (b) increased the par value of the 10,000,000 shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) issued to Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) in connection with the formation of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) (the “Formation Shares”) to the same par value as the shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) issued to the Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) shareholders. The Formation Shares were subsequently transferred by Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) to its subsidiary, Garmin Luxembourg S.à r.l. for future use to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares in connection with awards granted under our equity incentive plans
for employees and other general corporate purposes.

As a result of the redomestication, the shareholders of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) became shareholders of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland), and Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) became a subsidiary of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland). In addition, Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland) assumed, on a one-for-one basis, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman)’s existing obligations in connection with awards granted under Garmin Ltd. (Cayman)’s equity incentive plans and other similar equity awards. Any stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units or performance shares issued by Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) that are convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into common shares of Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) became convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, as the
case may be, into registered shares of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland).

Subsequently on July 26, 2010, Garmin Ltd. (Cayman) relocated its registered office to Switzerland and changed its name to Garmin Switzerland GmbH.  The reported capitalization of the Company also changed to that of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland).  Accordingly, common stock was increased by $1,796,448 to $1,797,435 (198,077,418 shares * CHF 10/ USD 9.0744)

,

and retained earnings was reduced by the same amount.

The par value of the share capital presented on the face of the balance sheet and in the consolidated statements of stockholders equity excludes the par value of the 10,000,000 formation shares.


Up to 104,038,709 conditional shares may be issued through the exercise of option rights which are granted to Garmin employees and/or members of its Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 104,038,709 additional shares no later than June 27, 2012.

The general terms of Garmin Ltd. (Switzerland)'s capitalization (rights of shareholders, limitations on dividends, etc.) may be found in the proxy statement and Form 8-A/A registration statement filed with the SEC on April 9, 2010 and June 28, 2010, respectively.

13. Warranty Reserves

The Company’s products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to two years.   The Company’s estimate of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions and are recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.   The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty reserve:


14.  Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited)

The above quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these interim periods presented have been included.  These results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results.

None.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

(a)  Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b)  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, 32.1 and 32.2.

Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”.

Based on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Garmin Ltd.

We have audited Garmin Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Garmin Ltd.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of

Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries

as of December 25, 2010 and December 26, 2009 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2010 of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries and our report dated February 23, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

(d)  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 25, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting
