Part I

Item 1.

Business

This discussion of the business of Garmin Ltd. ("Garmin" or the "Company") should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Item 7 herein and the information set forth in response to Item 101 of Regulation S-K in such Item 7 is incorporated herein by reference in partial response to this Item 1.  Garmin has identified five reportable segments for external reporting purposes: auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor. There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but are aggregated within the auto reportable segment.  The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), allocates resources and assesses performance of each operating segment individually.

Garmin was incorporated in Switzerland on February 9, 2010 as successor to Garmin Ltd., a Cayman Islands company (“Garmin Cayman”). Garmin Cayman was incorporated on July 24, 2000 as a holding company for Garmin Corporation, a Taiwan corporation, in order to facilitate a public offering of Garmin Cayman shares in the United States. On June 27, 2010, Garmin became the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group of companies pursuant to a share exchange transaction effected for the purpose of changing the place of incorporation of the ultimate parent holding company of the Garmin group from the Cayman Islands to Switzerland (the “Redomestication”).  Pursuant to the Redomestication, all issued and outstanding Garmin Cayman common shares were transferred to Garmin and each common share, par value U.S. $0.005 per share, of Garmin Cayman was exchanged for one registered share, par value 10 Swiss francs (CHF) per share, of Garmin.  At the Company’s Annual General Meeting on June 10, 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the cancellation of 10,000,000 registered shares of the Company held by the Company (the “Formation Shares”) and the reduction in par value of each share of the Company from CHF 10 to CHF 0.10 and the amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association to effect a corresponding share capital reduction. This share cancellation has reduced authorized shares from 208,077,418 shares to 198,077,418 shares, with an incremental 99,038,709 conditional shares that may be issued through the exercise of option rights, which are granted to Garmin employees or members of its Board of Directors. Garmin owns, directly or indirectly, all of the operating companies in the Garmin group.

Garmin’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statement and Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by Garmin’s directors and executive officers and all amendments to those reports will be made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of Garmin’s website (http://www.garmin.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  The SEC maintains a website (

http://www.sec.gov

) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

The reference to Garmin’s website address does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on this website, and such information should not be considered part of this report on Form 10-K.

Research and Development

Garmin’s product innovations are driven by its strong emphasis on research and development and the close partnership between Garmin’s engineering and manufacturing teams.  Garmin’s products are created by its engineering and development staff, which numbered approximately 4,500 people worldwide as of December 28, 2019.  Garmin’s manufacturing staff, which numbered approximately 4,900 people worldwide as of December 28, 2019, includes manufacturing process engineers who work closely with Garmin’s design engineers to ensure manufacturability and manufacturing cost control for its products. Garmin’s development staff includes industrial designers, as well as software engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and cartographic engineers. Garmin believes the industrial design of its products has played an important role in Garmin’s success.  Once a development project is initiated and approved, a multi-disciplinary team is created to design the product and transition it into manufacturing.

Manufacturing and Operations

Garmin believes one of its core competencies and strengths is its vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities at its Taiwan facilities in Xizhi, Jhongli and LinKou, its China facility in Yangzhou, its Netherlands facility in Wassenaar, and at its U.S. facilities in Olathe, Kansas and Salem, Oregon. Garmin believes that its ownership and operation of its own manufacturing facilities and distribution networks provides significant capability and flexibility to address the breadth and depth of resources necessary to serve its diverse products and markets.

Specifically, Garmin believes that its vertical integration of its manufacturing capabilities provides advantages to product cost, quality, and time to market.

Cost:

Garmin’s manufacturing resources rapidly and iteratively prototype designs, concepts, products and processes, achieving higher efficiency, resulting in lower cost.  Garmin’s vertical integration approach enables leveraging of manufacturing resources across high, mid and low volume products.  Sharing of these resources across product lines favorably affects Garmin’s costs to produce its range of products, with lower volume products realizing the economies of scale of higher volume products.  The ownership and integration of its resources allows

Garmin to optimize the design for manufacturing of its products, yielding improved cost.

Quality:

Garmin’s automation and sophisticated production processes provide in-service robustness and consistent reliability standards that enable Garmin to maintain strict process and quality control of the products manufactured, thereby improving the overall quality of our products.  Additionally, the immediate feedback throughout the manufacturing processes is provided to the development teams, providing integrated continuous improvement throughout design and supply chain.

Time to Market:

Garmin uses multi-disciplinary teams of design engineers, process engineers, and supply chain specialists to develop products, allowing them to quickly move from concept to manufacturing.  This integrated ownership provides inherent flexibility to enable faster time to market.

Garmin’s

design, manufacturing, distribution, and servicing processes in its U.S., Taiwan, China and U.K. facilities are certified to ISO 9001, an international quality standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization.  Garmin’s automotive operations in Taiwan, China, U.K., and Olathe have achieved IATF 16949 certification, a quality standard for automotive suppliers. Garmin’s Olathe and Salem aviation operations have achieved certification to AS9100, the quality standard for the aviation industry.

Garmin International, Inc., Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and Garmin Corporation have also achieved certification of their environmental management systems to the ISO 14001 standard, recognizing Garmin’s systems and processes which minimize or prevent harmful effects on the environment and continually strive to improve its environmental performance.


Materials

Although most components essential to Garmin’s

business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources, which subjects Garmin to supply and pricing risks.  Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including, but not limited to, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (DRAM), GPS chipsets and certain LCDs, are subject, at times, to industry-wide shortages and commodity pricing fluctuations.

Garmin and other participants in the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, aviation electronics, and consumer electronics industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. In addition, Garmin uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, tablet, mobile communication, and consumer electronics industries. New products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source until Garmin has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have

matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.  Garmin makes efforts to manage risks in these areas through the use of supply agreements and safety stock for strategically important components.

Seasonality

Our net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.  Sales of our consumer products are generally higher in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and, to a lesser extent, the second quarter due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.  Sales of consumer products are also influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Our auto OEM and aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of auto program manufacturing, aircraft certifications, regulatory mandates, and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Backlog

There is a relatively short cycle between order and shipment.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.  We typically ship most orders within 72 hours of receipt.

Intellectual Property

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, Garmin often relies on licenses of intellectual property for use in its business.  For example, Garmin obtains licenses from various sources for digital cartography technology for use in our products.

As of January 10, 2020, Garmin has been issued over 1,350 patents throughout the world and holds more than 900 trademark registrations.  The duration of patents varies in accordance with the provisions of applicable local law.  We believe that our continued success depends on the intellectual skills of our employees and their ability to continue to innovate.  Garmin will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect Garmin’s rights in its proprietary technologies.

There is no assurance that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may successfully withstand any challenge, in whole or in part. It is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or that the patents of others will preclude us from manufacturing and marketing certain products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity.


Regulations

The telecommunications industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory environment in which Garmin operates is subject to change.  In accordance with the United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.  Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.  A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business.  In addition, aviation products that are intended for installation in “type certificated aircraft” are required to be certified by the FAA, its European counterpart, the European Aviation Safety Agency, and other comparable organizations before they can be used in an aircraft.

Because Garmin Corporation, one of the Company’s principal subsidiaries, is located in Taiwan, foreign exchange control laws and regulations of Taiwan with respect to remittances into and out of Taiwan may have an impact on Garmin’s operations.  The Taiwan Foreign Exchange Control Statute, and regulations thereunder, provides that all foreign exchange transactions must be executed by banks designated to handle such business by the Ministry of Finance of Taiwan and by the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), also referred to as the CBC.  Current regulations favor trade-related foreign exchange transactions. Consequently, foreign currency earned from exports of merchandise and services may now be retained and used freely by exporters, while all foreign currency needed for the import of merchandise and services may be purchased freely from the designated foreign exchange banks.  Aside from trade-related foreign exchange transactions, Taiwan companies and residents may, without foreign exchange approval, remit outside and into Taiwan foreign currencies of up to $50 million and $5 million respectively, or their equivalent, each calendar year.  Currency conversions within the limits are processed by the designated banks and do not have to be reviewed and approved by the CBC.  The above limits apply to remittances involving a conversion between Taiwan Dollars and U.S. Dollars or other foreign currencies.  The CBC typically approves foreign exchange in excess of the limits if a party applies with the CBC for review and presents legitimate business reasons justifying the currency conversion.  A requirement is also imposed on all enterprises to register all medium and long-term foreign debt with the CBC.

Environmental Matters

Garmin’s operations are subject to various environmental laws, including laws addressing air and water pollution and management of hazardous substances and wastes.  Substantial noncompliance with applicable environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Capital expenditures for environmental controls are included in our normal capital budget. Historically, capital expenditures associated with environmental controls have not been material and compliance with environmental laws has not had a material impact on the Company’s competitive position.

Many of Garmin's products are subject to laws relating to the chemical and material composition of our products and their energy efficiency.  Garmin is also subject to laws requiring manufacturers to be financially responsible for collection, recovery and recycling of wastes from certain electronic products.  Compliance with current environmental laws does not have a material impact on our business, but the impact of future enactment of environmental laws cannot yet be fully determined and could be substantial.

Garmin has implemented multiple Environmental Management System (EMS) policies in accordance with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001 standard for Environmental Health and Safety Management.  Garmin’s EMS policies set forth practices, standards, and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at Garmin’s Kansas headquarters facility, Garmin’s European headquarters facility, and Garmin’s Taiwan and China manufacturing facilities.

Garmin continues to strive to reduce our carbon footprint by increasing our environmental sustainability efforts.  Our manufacturing locations have implemented increased recycling processes that keep all obsolete Garmin manufactured material from entering the waste stream. Additionally, our newly completed facility in Olathe, Kansas has been constructed with energy efficient considerations, including reduced water consumption, LED lighting, and reflective roofing to deflect solar radiation.


Employees

As of December 28, 2019, the Company had approximately 15,000 full and part-time employees worldwide, of whom approximately 5,700 were in Americas region, 7,300 were in APAC, and 2,000 were in EMEA.  Except for some of Garmin’s employees in Sweden, none of Garmin’s employees are represented by a labor union and none of Garmin's North American or Taiwan employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Garmin considers its employee relations to be positive.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The risks described below are not the only ones facing our company.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to the Company

If we are not successful in the continued development, timely manufacture, and introduction of new products or product categories, demand for our products could decrease to the extent that lost sales and profits from declining segments or product categories are not entirely offset.

We expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from sales of newly introduced products. This is particularly important to replace sales and profits lost in declining segments or product categories. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changes in customer needs. If we fail to introduce new products, or to modify or improve our existing products, in response to changes in technology, industry standards or customer needs, our products could rapidly become less competitive or obsolete.  We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products, enhance existing products and achieve market acceptance for such products.  However, there can be no assurance that development stage products will be successfully completed or, if developed, will achieve significant customer acceptance.

If we are unable to successfully develop and introduce competitive new products, and enhance our existing products, our future results of operations would be adversely affected.  Our pursuit of necessary technology may require substantial time and expense.  We may need to license new technologies to respond to technological change. These licenses may not be available to us on terms that we can accept or may materially change the gross profits that we are able to obtain on our products. We may not succeed in adapting our products to new technologies as they emerge.  Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve timely initial customer shipments of new products.  The timely availability of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success. Any future challenges related to new products, whether due to product development delays, manufacturing delays, lack of market acceptance, delays in regulatory approval, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, our resulting loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.

The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.  These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.  They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products or secure better product positioning with retailers.  Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and loss of market share.  Our failure to compete successfully against current or future competitors could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.


Maturation or contraction of the market for wearable devices or categories of devices could adversely affect our revenue and profits.

We have experienced growth in sales and profits in our outdoor and fitness segments, which in recent years have benefited from increased sales of wearable devices. If the overall wearable device market declines, or categories of devices within the wearable device market decline significantly, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Our annual and quarterly financial statements will reflect fluctuations in foreign currency translation.

The operation of our subsidiaries in global markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates.  We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. Dollar relative to certain other currencies.  The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. We have not historically used financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The currencies that typically create a majority of our exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling.

The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.  Other legal entities primarily use the local currency as the functional currency.  Due to the relative size of entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, fluctuations of other currencies are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

We translate income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date, and all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.  Income and expense activity in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar can be impacted by exchange rate variations over time.

The majority of our consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by exchange rate impacts on the significant cash, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.  Such gain or loss will create variations in our earnings per share.  However, because there is minimal cash impact caused by such exchange rate variations, management will continue to focus on our operating performance before the impact of foreign currency gains and losses.

Changes in applicable tax laws or resolutions of tax disputes could result in adverse tax consequences to the Company.

Our tax positions could be adversely impacted by changes to tax laws, tax treaties, or tax regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by any tax authority in which we file income tax returns, particularly in the US, Switzerland, Taiwan, and UK. We cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals.

Global taxing standards continue to evolve as a result of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) recommendations aimed at preventing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by multinational corporations.  While these recommendations do not change tax law, the countries where we operate may implement legislation or take unilateral actions which may result in adverse effects to our income tax provision and financial statements. Partially to respond to recent and continuing changes to global tax standards, we initiated an intercompany transaction which migrates ownership of certain consumer products intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, which is the primary location of research, development and executive management.  Due to the subjectivity inherent in transfer pricing associated with this intercompany transaction, we are pursuing an advanced pricing agreement with relevant jurisdictions to provide certainty regarding the pricing. However, we are unable to predict the outcome of the final advanced pricing agreement and related negotiations, which could materially and/or adversely impact our income tax provision, net income or cash flows for periods during negotiation and upon finalization.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain, most notably in the area of transfer pricing. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.


Changes to trade regulations, including trade restrictions, sanctions, or tariffs, could significantly harm our results of operations.

We manufacture goods in the People’s Republic of China and import certain materials from the People’s Republic of China that are used to manufacture goods in the United States.  The imposition of additional governmental controls or regulations that create new or enhanced restrictions on free trade, trade sanctions, or tariffs, particularly those applicable to materials or goods from the People’s Republic of China, could have a substantial adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Economic, regulatory, and political conditions and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue and profits.

Our revenue and profits depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for products in the markets in which we compete.  We have global operations which make up a significant portion of our total revenue, which can present challenges depending on economic and geopolitical conditions on both a global and regional scale.  Economic weakness or constrained consumer and business spending has resulted in periods of decreased revenue in the past, and could in the future result in decreased revenue and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our retailers and OEM customers have resulted, and could result in the future, in significant bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We may experience unique economic and political risks associated with companies that operate in Taiwan.

Our principal manufacturing facilities, where we manufacture most of our consumer products, are located in Taiwan.  Relations between Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, also referred to as the PRC, and other factors affecting the political or economic conditions of Taiwan in the future, could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price and the liquidity of our shares.

The PRC asserts sovereignty over all of China, including Taiwan, certain other islands, and all of mainland China.  The PRC government does not recognize the legitimacy of the Taiwan government.  Although significant economic and cultural relations have been established during recent years between Taiwan and the PRC, the PRC government has indicated that it may use military force to gain control over Taiwan in certain circumstances, such as the declaration of independence by Taiwan.  The United States' relations with Taiwan are governed by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which signifies when the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC, referred to as the "one-China" policy. Deviations from the "one-China" policy could lead to adverse changes in China-U.S. and China-Taiwan relations and could adversely affect our operations in Taiwan in the future.

If we do not correctly anticipate demand for our products, we may not be able to secure sufficient quantities or cost-effective production of our products or we could have costly excess production or inventories.

We have generally been able to increase or decrease production to meet fluctuations in demand.  However, the demand for our products depends on many factors and may be difficult to forecast.  We expect that it will become more difficult to forecast demand as we introduce and support a diverse product portfolio, as competition in the market for our products intensifies and as the markets for some of our products mature.  Significant unanticipated fluctuations in demand could cause the following problems in our operations:

•

If demand increases beyond what we forecast, we would have to rapidly increase production. We would depend on suppliers to provide additional volumes of components and those suppliers might not be able to increase production rapidly enough to meet unexpected demand.

•

Rapid increases in production levels to meet unanticipated demand could result in higher costs for manufacturing and supply of components and other expenses.  These higher costs could lower our profit margins.  Further, if production is increased rapidly, manufacturing quality could decline, which may also lower our margins and reduce customer satisfaction.

•

If forecasted demand does not develop, we could have excess inventories of finished products and components, which would use cash and could lead to write-offs of some or all of the excess inventories.  Lower than forecasted demand could also result in excess manufacturing capacity or reduced manufacturing efficiencies at our facilities, which could result in lower margins.


We depend on third party suppliers and licensors, some of which are sole source, for specific components and map data used in our products. Our production and business would be seriously harmed if these suppliers are not able to meet our demand and alternative sources are not available, or if the costs of components rise.

We are dependent on third party suppliers for various components used in our current products.  Some of the components that we procure from third party suppliers include semiconductors and electroluminescent panels, liquid crystal displays, memory chips, batteries and microprocessors.  The cost, quality and availability of components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products.  Some components we use are from sole source suppliers. Certain application-specific integrated circuits incorporating our proprietary designs are manufactured for us by sole source suppliers.  Alternative sources may not be currently available for these sole source components.

In the past, we have experienced shortages of certain components.  In addition, if there are shortages in supply of components, the costs of such components may rise. If suppliers are unable to meet our demand for components on a timely basis and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if the price of the alternative source is prohibitive, our ability to maintain timely and cost-effective production of our products would be seriously harmed.

We are also dependent on third party licensors for digital mapping data used in our products.  There are only a limited number of suppliers of mapping data for some of our products and geographical regions.  If we are unable to continue licensing such mapping data from our suppliers and are unable to obtain an alternative source, or if our relationships with our suppliers change detrimentally, our ability to supply mapping data for use in our products would be seriously harmed.

The effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), including trade agreements, are not yet known and the uncertainty creates challenges and risks which could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.

The United Kingdom (UK) formally left the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020. A transition period through December 31, 2020 has been established to allow the UK and EU to negotiate the terms of the UK’s withdrawal. However, there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the UK and EU, including trade agreements between the UK and EU. Additionally, long-term risks of Brexit include economic recessions in the UK or other European markets and currency instability for both the British Pound Sterling and the Euro.

We have operations in the UK, including offices and a distribution facility, and several EU member states, and therefore Brexit will impact our operations. We have certain measures in place to reduce the impact to our business operations; however, risks such as slow or inefficient border clearance, prolonged economic recession, and currency fluctuations could have material adverse effects on our business operations, results of operations, and financial condition. As noted in our other risk factors, currency volatility of the British Sterling Pound and Euro could have significant effects on our results of operations. Depending on finalization of a trade agreement between the UK and the EU during the transition period, the impacts of Brexit may have a lesser impact to our financial condition and business operations. Given the number of different outcomes still possible, the impacts of Brexit are difficult to determine until specific terms of the withdrawal are reached.

Our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, and we could suffer loss if they infringe upon others’ rights or are infringed upon by others.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  To this end, we hold rights to a number of patents and registered trademarks and regularly file applications to attempt to protect our rights in new technology and trademarks.  However, there is no guarantee that our patent applications will become issued patents, or that our trademark applications will become registered trademarks.  In addition, effective copyright, patent and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain countries.  Moreover, even if approved, our patents or trademarks may thereafter be successfully challenged by others or otherwise become invalidated for a variety of reasons.  Thus, any patents or trademarks we currently have or may later acquire may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.


The value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many patent filings. Third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.  The number of these claims has increased in recent years and may continue to increase in the future. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  From time to time we receive letters alleging infringement of patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights and we have been, and currently are, a defendant in lawsuits alleging patent infringement.  Litigation concerning patents or other intellectual property is costly and time consuming.  We may seek licenses from such parties, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms.  Such infringement claims could also cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend or permanently cease the use of critical technologies or processes or the production or sale of major products.

We may become subject to significant product liability costs.

If our products malfunction or contain errors or defects, we could be subject to significant liability for personal injury and property damage and, under certain circumstances, could be subject to a judgment for punitive damages.  We maintain insurance against accident-related risks involving our products.  However, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be sufficient to cover the cost of damages to others or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.  In addition, insurance coverage may not cover awards of punitive damages and may not cover the cost of associated legal fees and defense costs, which could result in lower margins.  If we are unable to maintain sufficient insurance to cover product liability costs or if our insurance coverage does not cover the award, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.

We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict. Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or we may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Continued declines in auto PND revenue and significant investments in auto OEM could negatively impact total Company profits and shareholder value.

We experienced substantial growth through 2008 in our auto segment as PNDs became mass-market consumer electronics in both Europe and North America.  This auto PND market is declining as competing technologies emerged and market saturation occurred.  Navigation technologies have been incorporated into and become more prevalent in competing devices such as mobile handsets, tablets, and new automobiles through factory-installed systems.  The acceptance by consumers of these alternative solutions has negatively impacted sales and profits in the auto segment.  There is no assurance that the decline in sales will end, and thus no assurance that we can continue to generate profits from the auto segment.

We have recently been awarded several tier-one and tier-two auto OEM supplier contracts.  To fulfill the associated program commitments, we are investing significantly in facilities, research and development, and other operating expenses and we will continue to do so in the coming years.  Gross margins associated with these auto OEM programs are expected to be lower than the gross margins realized in the auto segment and the Company as a whole in recent periods.  If we are not successful in winning additional contract awards or substantially leveraging our investments, periods of lower operating income or operating losses in the auto segment could negatively impact total Company profits and shareholder value.


Our products may contain undetected security vulnerabilities, which could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources and increased warranty claims, and litigation

.

Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competitive products.

We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business.

We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data. Our users’ personal information may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment account information, height, weight, age, gender, heart rates, sleeping patterns, GPS-based location, and activity patterns. Due to the volume and types of the personal information and data we manage and the nature of our products and applications, the security features of our platform and information systems are critical. If our security measures or applications are breached, are disrupted or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to user data. If we or our third-party service providers, business partners, or third-party apps with which our users choose to share their Garmin data were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our users’ data or the media suggested that our security measures or those of our third-party service providers were insufficient, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products and services could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, and regulatory proceedings. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach, disruption or other unauthorized access to our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident and we may need to provide some form of remedy

for the individuals affected by the incident.

A growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data. Our users may also accidentally disclose or lose control of their passwords, creating the perception that our systems or those of our third-party service providers are not secure against third-party access. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, business partners, service providers, or developers, violate applicable laws, agreements, or our policies, such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. While we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.

Regulatory authorities and legislative bodies around the world, including in the United States, have enacted or are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in the EU. On January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) went into effect, and other States in the United States are considering adopting data privacy laws. Noncompliance with GDPR. CCPA, or other data protection laws in other States in the United States or in other countries, could result in significant fines and penalties. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Latin America, and elsewhere are sometimes uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our interpretation and data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.


We rely on information technology systems for our business operations. Failures or disruptions, including security breaches or cyber attacks, to our information technology systems may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and result of operations.

Our information technology systems allow for our daily business operations to operate efficiently and effectively. These systems assist in our business processes, including, but not limited to, communications, financial management, supply chain management, order processing, shipping and billing, and providing services and support to our customers. Additionally, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our facilities and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. A disruption to any of these processes can adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, a breach of our security systems and procedures or those of our vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property as well as our customers' or our employees' intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information.  A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results as a result of theft of our intellectual property and could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted product and service provider by adversely affecting the market's perception of the security or reliability of our products or services.

We have technology and processes in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our customers and employees. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate information.

Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to conduct additional employee training, and to engage third party security experts and consultants. Our technology errors and omissions insurance may not protect against all of the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system failure.  If we fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, we may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.  In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject us to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.

Gross margins for our products may fluctuate or erode.

Gross margins in some of our segments are volatile and could decline in the future due to competitive price reductions that are not fully offset by material cost reductions. In addition, our overall gross margin may fluctuate from period to period due to a number of factors, including product mix, competition and unit volumes.  In particular, the average selling prices of a specific product tend to decrease over that product’s life.  To offset such decreases, we intend to rely primarily on component cost reduction, obtaining yield improvements and corresponding cost reductions in the manufacturing of existing products and on introducing new products that incorporate advanced features and therefore can be sold at higher average selling prices.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such yield improvements or cost reductions or introduce any such new products in the future.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner or our products do not achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.


Changes in our United States federal income tax classification, or that of our subsidiaries, could result in adverse tax consequences to our 10% or greater U.S. shareholders.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Act”) signed on December 22, 2017 may have changed the consequences to U.S. shareholders that own, or are considered to own, as a result of the attribution rules, ten percent or more of the voting power or value of the stock of a non-U.S. corporation (a 10% U.S. shareholder) under the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of U.S. controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”).

Prior to the 2017 Act, the Company did not believe we, or any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, were considered a CFC, which is a determination made daily based on whether the 10% U.S. shareholders together own, or are considered to own as a result of the attribution rules, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of a non-U.S. corporation.  The 2017 Act repealed Internal Revenue Code Section 958(b)(4), which, unless clarified in future regulations or other guidance, may result in classification of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries as CFCs with respect to any single 10% U.S. shareholder.  This may be the result without regard to whether 10% U.S. shareholders together own, directly or indirectly, more than fifty percent of the voting power or value of the Company as was the case under prior rules.  The repeal is effective as of the last taxable year of CFCs beginning before January 1, 2018 and for the taxable year of 10% U.S. shareholders in which the CFCs' taxable year ends.

Additional tax consequences to 10% U.S. shareholders of a CFC may result from other provisions of the 2017 Act.  For example, the 2017 Act amended Section 965 to require 10% U.S. shareholders to include in income their pro-rata share of certain earnings and profits (E&P) of CFCs.  This Section 965 inclusion is accompanied by a partial dividends-received deduction.  The 2017 Act also added Section 951A which requires a 10% U.S. shareholder of a CFC to include in income its pro-rata share of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of the CFC.  Finally, the 2017 Act eliminated the requirement in Section 951(a) necessitating that a foreign corporation be considered a CFC for an uninterrupted period of at least 30 days in order for a 10% U.S. shareholder to have a current income inclusion.

From time to time, the Company may elect to employ antidilutive measures such as a stock buyback program.  These measures could inadvertently create additional 10% U.S. shareholders and thus trigger adverse tax consequences for those shareholders as described above.  We urge shareholders to consult their individual tax advisers for advice regarding the 2017 Act revisions to the U.S. federal income tax law applicable to owners of CFCs given the current uncertainty regarding their scope of applicability.

Some of our products are subject to governmental regulation or certification. Failure to obtain required certifications of our products on a timely basis, either due to government shutdown or other delays in the certification process, could harm our business.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification is required for all of our aviation products that are intended for installation in type-certificated aircraft.  To the extent required, certification is an expensive and time-consuming process that requires significant focus and resources.  An inability to obtain, or excessive delay in obtaining, such certifications could have an adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products and, for certain aviation OEM products, our customers’ ability to sell airplanes. Delays in our obtaining certification for our aviation products have resulted, and may in the future result in our being required to pay compensation to our customers.  Additionally, failure of the United States Congress to appropriate funds for FAA operations that results in a shut down of FAA operations or furloughing of FAA employees, due to partial or complete government shutdowns or otherwise, could result in delays in the required FAA certification of our avionics products and in the production, sale and registration of aircraft that use our avionics products. Therefore, such inabilities or delays could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

In addition, we cannot assure that our certified products will not be decertified.  Any such decertification could have an adverse effect on our operating results.

In addition, in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, wireless transceiver products are required to be certified by the FCC in the United States and comparable authorities in foreign countries where they are sold.  Garmin’s products sold in Europe are required to comply with relevant directives of the European Commission.  A delay in receiving required certifications for new products, or enhancements to Garmin’s products, or losing certification for Garmin’s existing products could adversely affect our business.


Our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel.

Our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our key executive, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and administrative personnel.  We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our key executive officers. Swiss law prohibits us from paying severance payments to our senior executive officers, which may impair our ability to recruit for these positions.  We do not have key person life insurance on any of our key executive officers and do not currently intend to obtain such insurance.  The loss of the services of any of our senior level management, or other key employees, could harm our business.  Recruiting and retaining the skilled personnel we require to maintain and grow our market position may be difficult.  For example, in some recent years there has been a nationwide shortage of qualified engineers in the United States who are necessary for us to design and develop new products, and therefore, it has sometimes been challenging to recruit such personnel.  If we fail to hire and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to maintain and expand our business.

Our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and seasonality.

Our operating results are difficult to predict. Our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.  If such operating results decline, the price of our stock could decline.  As we have expanded our operations, our operating expenses, particularly our research and development costs, have increased as a percentage of our sales in some periods.  If revenues decrease and we continue to increase research and development costs, our operating results would be negatively affected.

Historically, our revenues have been lower in the first quarter of each fiscal year as many of our devices are highly consumer-oriented, and consumer buying is traditionally lower in this quarter.  Sales of certain of our auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor products tend to be higher in our second fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending for such products in the spring season and travel season.  Sales of many of our consumer products also have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter due to increased consumer spending patterns on electronic devices during the holiday season.

We rely on independent dealers and distributors to sell our products, and disruption to these channels would harm our business.

Because we sell many of our products to independent dealers and distributors, we are subject to many risks, including risks related to their inventory levels and support for our products.  In particular, our dealers and distributors maintain significant levels of our products in their inventories.  If dealers and distributors attempt to reduce their levels of inventory or if they do not maintain sufficient levels to meet customer demand, our sales could be negatively impacted.

Many of our dealers and distributors also sell products offered by our competitors.  If our competitors offer our dealers and distributors more favorable terms, those dealers and distributors may de-emphasize or decline to carry our products. In the future, we may not be able to retain or attract a sufficient number of qualified dealers and distributors.  If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with dealers and distributors or to expand our distribution channels, our business will suffer.

We may pursue strategic acquisitions, investments, strategic partnerships or other ventures, and our business could be materially harmed if we fail to successfully identify, evaluate, complete, and integrate such transactions.

We intend to evaluate acquisition opportunities and opportunities to make investments in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, or to enter into strategic partnerships with parties who can provide access to those assets, additional product or services offerings, additional distribution or marketing synergies or additional industry expertise.  We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment or strategic partnership candidates, or if we do identify suitable candidates in the future, we may not be able to complete those transactions on commercially favorable terms, or at all.


Any past or future acquisition could also result in difficulties assimilating acquired employees, operations, and products and diversion of capital and management’s attention away from other business issues and opportunities.  Integration of acquired companies may result in problems related to integration of technology and inexperienced management teams. Due diligence performed prior to closing acquisitions may not uncover certain risks or liabilities that could materially impact our business and financial results.  In addition, the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us.  We may not successfully integrate internal controls, compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the GDPR and other corporate governance and regulatory matters, operations, personnel or products related to acquisitions we may make in the future.  If we fail to successfully integrate such transactions, our business could be materially harmed.

Many of our products rely on the Global Positioning System and other Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS).

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation and positioning system consisting of a constellation of orbiting satellites.  The satellites and their ground control and monitoring stations are maintained and operated by the United States Department of Defense.  The Department of Defense does not currently charge users for access to the satellite signals.  These satellites and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible sabotage. The satellites were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However, of the current deployment of satellites in place, some have been operating for more than 20 years.

To repair damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible. If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites. A reduction in the number of operating satellites may impair the current utility of GPS and the growth of current and additional market opportunities. GPS satellites and ground control segments are being modernized. GPS modernization software updates can cause problems. We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of GPS updates.

GPS is operated by the U.S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS; however, if the policy were to change, and GPS were no longer supported by the U.S. Government, or if user fees were imposed, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Some of our products also use signals from Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) that augment GPS, such as the U.S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), Japanese MTSAT-based Satellite Augmentation System (MSAS), and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS).  Any curtailment of SBAS operating capability could result in decreased user capability for many of our aviation products, thereby impacting our markets.

Some of our products also use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS System. Other countries, including China and India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products which use GNSS signals from these systems. The European community is developing an independent radio navigation satellite system, known as Galileo. National or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position. Use of non-US GNSS signals may also be subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations. If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, it could result in lost revenue.

Any of the foregoing factors could affect the willingness of buyers of our products to select Global Positioning System-based products instead of products based on competing technologies.


Our business is subject to disruptions and uncertainties caused by geopolitical instability, war or terrorism.

Acts of war or acts of terrorism, especially any directed at the GPS signals, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism, may cause a redeployment of the satellites used in GPS or interruptions of the system. To the extent that such interruptions have an effect on sales of our products, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

A shut down of airspace or imposition of restrictions on general aviation would harm our business.  The shutdown of airspace could cause reduced sales of our general aviation products and delays in the shipment of our products manufactured in our Taiwan manufacturing facilities to our global distribution facilities, thereby adversely affecting our ability to supply new and existing products to our dealers and distributors.

Any reallocation or repurposing of radio frequency spectrum could cause harmful interference with the reception of Global Positioning System signals. This interference could harm our business.

Our Global Positioning System technology is dependent on the use of the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) provided by the U.S. Government’s GPS satellites.  GPS operates in radio frequency bands that are globally allocated for radio navigation satellite services.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations. These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also has regulatory authority on how each band is used.  In the United States, the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.

Any ITU or national reallocation of radio frequency spectrum, including frequency band segmentation or sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant negative impacts on our business and our customers.

Natural disasters, catastrophic events, or climate change could affect our financial results.

Natural disasters and extreme weather events, such as tsunamis or earthquakes, and medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease), could occur in a region where we have a manufacturing or warehousing facility which would cause disruptions in our business operations or loss of inventory. These events could also have an impact on our suppliers and affect our supply chain. If our backup and recovery plans are not sufficient to minimize business disruption and if our insurance is not sufficient to recover the costs associated with these types of events, our financial results could be adversely affected.

Climate change can also pose a risk to our business due to evolving regulatory and legislative measures surrounding climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the authority granted to it under the Clean Air Act.  At the federal legislative level, U.S. Congress could pass legislation to adopt some form of federal mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction, such as a nationwide cap-and-trade program. It is also possible that the U.S. Congress may pass alternative climate change bills that do not mandate a nationwide cap-and-trade program and instead focus on promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. Such measures could influence mobility and transportation trends, which could decrease the demand for certain of our products.

Because it is uncertain what laws and regulations will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws and regulations on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Risks Relating to Our Shares

The volatility of our stock price could adversely affect investment in our common shares.

The market price of our shares has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During 2019, the closing price of our shares ranged from a low of $61.39 to a high of $98.68. A variety of factors could cause the price of our shares to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:

•

new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;

•

general conditions in the worldwide economy, including fluctuations in interest rates and global currency exchange rates;

•

announcements of technological innovations;

•

product obsolescence and our ability to manage product transitions;

•

developments in our relationships with our customers and suppliers;

•

the availability, pricing and timeliness of delivery of components, such as flash memory and liquid crystal displays, used in our products;

•

quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;

•

changes in applicable tax laws and tax rates;

•

developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and litigation;

•

announcements and rumors of developments related to our business, our competitors, our suppliers or the markets in which we compete;

•

research reports or opinions issued by securities analysts or brokerage houses related to Garmin, our competitors, our suppliers or our customers;

•

any significant acts of terrorism against the United States, Taiwan or significant markets where we sell our products; and

•

other factors as discussed in the previously listed risks.

In addition, in recent years the stock market in general and the markets for shares of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.

Our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us.

As of January 16, 2020, members of our Board of Directors, and our executive officers, together with their respective immediate family members and entities that may be deemed affiliates of or related to such persons or entities, beneficially owned approximately 22% of our outstanding shares. Accordingly, these shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, such as mergers and acquisitions and shareholder proposals. This level of ownership may have a significant effect in delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of Garmin and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other holders of our common shares.

The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law.

The rights of our shareholders are governed by Swiss law and Garmin Ltd.’s articles of association. The rights of shareholders under Swiss law differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law allows our shareholders acting at a shareholders’ meeting to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without approval of a shareholders’ meeting, but this authorization is limited to 50% of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed at a shareholders’ meeting at least every two years for it to continue to be available. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, including the exceptions described in our articles of association, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares and other securities. Swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, Swiss law provides that dividends and other distributions must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.


We have limited capital reserves from which to make distributions or repurchase shares without subjecting our shareholders to Switzerland withholding tax.

As of December 28, 2019, we had CHF 5,650 million of unappropriated capital contribution reserves available from which the Company may make dividend payments or utilize to repurchase shares for which no withholding tax applies.  At the time this reserve balance has been returned to shareholders through dividends or share repurchases, a Swiss federal withholding tax of 35% will generally be applicable to any dividends paid to shareholders.  The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the Swiss federal Tax Administration.  A holder that qualifies for benefits under a double tax treaty may be able to recover partial withholding tax.  For example, a U.S holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15% treaty rate (or in excess of the 5% reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10% participation in our voting stock, or for a full refund in case of qualified pension funds).

After we have exhausted our remaining capital contribution reserves by appropriating them for dividends or share repurchases, any dividends paid by the Company will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at 35%.

However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future or that a change in Swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders, in particular as a result of distributions out of capital contribution reserves becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions. If we are unable to pay a dividend out of capital contribution reserves, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.

Under current Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax on the difference between the par value and the repurchase price. However, the portion of the repurchase price that is attributed to capital contribution reserves of the shares repurchased will not be subject to the Swiss withholding tax. Therefore, repurchase of our own shares further limits the amount of capital reserves available for distributions to shareholders free of Swiss withholding taxes. No partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares to the extent sufficient capital reserves are available. However, should we not resell such treasury shares within six years and there is not sufficient capital contribution reserves, the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six-year period.

There is uncertainty as to our shareholders’ ability to enforce certain foreign civil liabilities in Switzerland and Taiwan.

We are a Swiss company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States, particularly in Taiwan.  As a result, it may be difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon us.  In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of Switzerland or Taiwan would recognize or enforce judgments of United States courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof, or be competent to hear original actions brought in Switzerland or Taiwan against us predicated upon the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof.


We have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares.

Under Swiss law we have certain limitations on our ability to repurchase and hold our own shares. We and our subsidiaries may only repurchase and hold our own shares to the extent that sufficient freely distributable reserves (including contributed surplus as determined for Swiss tax and statutory purposes) are available. The aggregate par value of our registered shares held by us and our subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our registered share capital. We may repurchase our registered shares beyond the statutory limit of 10%, however, if our shareholders have adopted a resolution at a general meeting of shareholders authorizing the board of directors to repurchase registered shares in an amount in excess of 10% and the repurchased shares are dedicated for cancellation. Any restriction on our ability to repurchase our shares could make our stock less attractive to investors.

Properties

Garmin and its subsidiaries own a majority of their principal properties and lease certain other properties. Depending on location, the properties could be used for manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, office space, or a combination of activities. Garmin’s principal properties are described below:

Garmin International, Inc. and Garmin USA, Inc. own and occupy facilities of approximately 1,990,000 square feet on approximately 107 acres in Olathe, Kansas, where the majority of product design and development work is conducted, the majority of aviation panel-mount products are manufactured, and products are warehoused, distributed, and supported for North, Central and South America.  The 1,990,000 square feet includes a newly constructed 775,000 square foot manufacturing and distribution center. The previous manufacturing and distribution space is currently being renovated into a research and development facility and supporting office space. In connection with the bond financings for the facility in Olathe and the expansions of that facility, the City of Olathe holds the legal title to the Olathe facilities, which are leased to Garmin’s subsidiaries by the City.  Upon the payment in full of the outstanding bonds, the City of Olathe is obligated to transfer title to Garmin’s subsidiaries for the aggregate sum of $200.  Garmin International, Inc. has purchased all the outstanding bonds and expects to continue to hold the bonds until maturity in order to benefit from property tax abatement.

Garmin International, Inc. leases 148,000 square feet of land at New Century Airport in Gardner, Kansas under a ground lease and occupies two aircraft hangars on this land, one of which is owned (47,000 square feet) and the other leased (53,000 square feet).  Both properties serve as flight test and certification facilities that are used in development and certification of aviation products.

Garmin AT, Inc. leases approximately 18 acres of land in Salem, Oregon under a ground lease.  This ground lease expires in 2030, but Garmin AT, Inc. has the option to extend the ground lease until 2050.  Garmin AT, Inc. owns and occupies a 115,000 square foot facility for office, development and manufacturing use and a 33,000 square foot aircraft hangar that serves as a flight test and certification facility on this land.  Garmin AT, Inc. also owns and occupies an additional 66,000 square foot facility on the same property for Garmin’s West Coast customer support call center and for research and development activities.

Garmin Corporation owns and occupies 247,000 and 185,000 square foot facilities in Xizhi Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan, a 224,000 square foot facility in Jhongli, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan, and a 576,000 square foot facility in LinKou, Tao-Yang County, Taiwan.  Garmin China YangZhou Co., Ltd. leases a 204,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China. These facilities are used for the manufacturing and warehousing of most of Garmin’s auto, fitness, marine, and outdoor products, as well as portable aviation products. These facilities are also used for some research and development activities and the marketing and support of products for Asia Pacific countries.


Garmin (Europe) Ltd. owns and occupies a 155,000 square foot building located in Totton, Southampton, England, used as offices and a distribution facility.

Garmin also owns and leases other properties, both internationally and domestically, not described above, that are used for office space, retail, and warehousing.

Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to the Company’s fiscal year and fiscal periods.  Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this document to "we," "us," "our" and similar terms refer to Garmin Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts set forth in the tables are in thousands, except per share data.

Overview

We are a leading worldwide provider of navigation, communications and information devices, most of which are enabled by Global Positioning System, or GPS, technology.  We operate in five reportable segments, which serve the auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor markets.  Our auto reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments; auto PND and auto OEM. Each operating segment offers products through our network of subsidiary distributors and independent dealers and distributors, as well as through OEMs. Each of the operating segments is managed separately.

Since our first products were delivered in 1991, we have generated positive income from operations each year and have funded our growth from these profits.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

General

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The presentation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer sales programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, and contingencies and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.


Goodwill

We allocate goodwill to reporting units in proportion to the expected benefit from each business combination.  Each of the Company’s operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor) represents a distinct reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the operating performance indicators, competition, or expectations about future market or economic conditions.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant assumptions, including discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins, and terminal growth rates.  The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

We recognize liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions, including those related to transfer pricing, based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  We recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be not required or it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

Assessing uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment, including the evaluation of unique facts and circumstances and the interpretation of laws and regulations, especially the assessment of pricing analyses that may produce various ranges of outcomes.  Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Other

For further information on the Company’s critical accounting policies, refer to the discussion in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements as indicated in the table below:

Accounting Terms and Characteristics

Net Sales

Our net sales are primarily generated through sales to our retail partners, dealer and distributor network and to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).  Refer to the Revenue Recognition discussion in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  We aim to achieve a quick turnaround on orders we receive, and we typically ship most orders within 72 hours.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to the understanding of our business.


Net sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation.  Typically, sales of our consumer products are highest in the fourth quarter due to increased demand during the holiday buying season, and in the second quarter, due to increased demand during the spring and summer season.  Our

auto OEM

and

aviation products do not experience much seasonal variation, but are more influenced by the timing of

auto program manufacturing,

aircraft certifications

, regulatory mandates,

and the release of new products when the initial demand is typically the strongest.

Cost of Sales/Gross Profit

Raw material costs are our most significant component of cost of goods sold.  Our existing practice of performing the design and manufacture of our products in-house has enabled us to source components from different suppliers and, where possible, to redesign our products to leverage lower cost components.  We believe that our flexible production model allows our Xizhi, Jhongli, and LinKou manufacturing plants in Taiwan; Yangzhou manufacturing plant in China; our Wassenaar manufacturing plant in the Netherlands; and our Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon manufacturing plants in the U.S. to experience relatively low costs of manufacturing.  In general, products manufactured in Taiwan have been our highest volume products.  Our manufacturing labor costs historically have been lower in Taiwan and China than in Olathe and Salem.

Sales price variability has had and can be expected to have an effect on our gross profit.  Our gross profit is dependent on segment mix, and to a lesser extent, product mix within each segment.

Advertising Expense

Our advertising expenses consist primarily of costs for media advertising, cooperative advertising with our retail partners, point of sale displays, and sponsorships.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of:

•

salaries for sales, marketing and product support personnel;

•

salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel;

•

marketing, and other brand building costs;

•

finance and legal costs;

•

human resource costs;

•

information systems and infrastructure costs;

•

travel and related costs; and

•

occupancy and other overhead costs.

Research and Development

The majority of our research and development costs represent salaries for our engineers and costs of test equipment and components used in product and prototype development.

We are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive for expanded ability to serve our existing consumer and aviation markets as well as new markets for active lifestyle products.

Income Taxes

We have experienced a relatively low effective income tax rate due to the proportion of our income generated by entities in tax jurisdictions with low statutory rates.


Results of Operations

The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of net sales during the periods shown (the table may not foot due to rounding):

The following table sets forth our results of operations through operating income for each of our five segments during the period shown.  The Company’s CODM uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses.  Net sales are directly attributed to each segment.  Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated.  For each line item in the table, the total of the segments’ amounts equals the amount in the consolidated statements of income data included in Item 6.

As indicated in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses was refined at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. The amounts presented below for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 are presented here as they were originally reported.  For comparative purposes, we estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 would have been approximately $18 million less for the aviation segment, approximately $11 million more for the marine segment, approximately $7 million more for the outdoor segment, and not significantly different for the auto and fitness segments. We estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 would have been approximately $14 million less for the aviation segment, approximately $8 million less for the fitness segment, approximately $8 million more for the marine segment, and approximately $7 million more for each of the outdoor and auto segments.


Net Sales


Net sales increased 12% in 2019 when compared to the year-ago period. All segments had an increase in revenue except for auto. Fitness revenue represented the largest portion of our revenue mix in 2019 at 28% compared to 26% in 2018.

Total unit sales increased 5% to 15.6 million units in 2019 from 14.9 million units in 2018.

Fitness, outdoor, aviation, and marine revenues increased 22%, 13%, 22%, and 15%, respectively when compared to the year-ago period. The fitness segment revenue increase was primarily driven by strong sales in wearables and sales from Tacx, a newly acquired group of subsidiaries that designs and manufactures indoor bike trainers. The outdoor segment revenue increase was driven by sales growth in multiple product categories, primarily led by adventure watches.  Aviation segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth in both aftermarket and OEM categories. Marine segment revenue increases were driven by sales growth across multiple product categories, primarily chartplotters and SONAR products. Auto segment revenue decreased 14% from the year-ago period, due to the ongoing auto PND market contraction and lower auto OEM program sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit dollars in fiscal year 2019 increased 13% while gross margin was slightly higher compared to fiscal year 2018. Gross margin increased 410 basis points in the auto segment when compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to lower license expense. Gross margin remained relatively flat within the outdoor, marine, and aviation segments. Gross margin decreased in the fitness segment primarily due to lower average selling prices and product mix.

Advertising Expenses

Advertising expense increased 6% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018. The overall increase in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to increased cooperative advertising in the outdoor, fitness, and marine segments and increased media advertising in the outdoor and fitness segments. These increases were partially offset by decreased cooperative advertising expense in the auto and aviation segments. All segments were relatively flat as a percent of revenue compared to the prior year.


Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expense increased 8% in absolute dollars and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year. The absolute dollar increase was primarily attributable to personnel costs, legal related costs, and expenses from recent acquisitions.

As noted above and in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company refined its methodology to allocate certain selling, general and administrative expenses at the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year. The prior year amounts are presented here as originally reported. For comparative purposes, we estimate selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2018 would have been approximately $18 million more for the aviation segment, approximately $11 million less for the marine segment, approximately $7 million less for the outdoor segment, and not significantly different for the fitness and auto segments. We estimate the selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal 2017 would have been approximately $14 million more for the aviation segment, approximately $8 million more for the fitness segment, approximately $8 million less for the marine segment, and approximately $7 million less for each of the outdoor and auto segments.

In addition to the change in methodology of allocating certain selling, general and administrative expenses noted above, marine decreased in fiscal 2019, as a percent of revenue, from the previous year due to greater leverage of operating costs.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development expense increased 7% in absolute dollars when compared to the year-ago period and was relatively flat as a percent of revenue. The absolute dollar increase was primarily due to engineering personnel costs related to our wearable and aviation product offerings and expenses resulting from recent acquisitions, partially offset by the capitalization of certain contractually reimbursable preproduction design and development personnel costs within the auto segment. Our research and development spending is focused on product development, improving existing software capabilities, and exploring new categories.


Operating Income

Total operating income increased 21% in absolute dollars and increased 190 basis points as a percent of revenue when compared to fiscal year 2018.  The growth in total operating income on an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of revenue was the result of revenue growth, slightly higher gross margin, and greater leverage of operating expenses, as discussed above.

Other Income (Expense)

The average returns on cash and investments, including interest and capital gain/loss returns during the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were 2.0% and 1.8%, respectively.  Interest income increased primarily due to slightly higher yields on fixed-income securities.

Foreign currency gains and losses for the Company are typically driven by movements in the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling in relation to the U.S. Dollar.  The Taiwan Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin Corporation, the U.S. Dollar is the functional currency of Garmin (Europe) Ltd., and the Euro is the functional currency of most of our other European subsidiaries, although some transactions and balances are denominated in British Pounds.  The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity.  Due to the relative size of the entities using a functional currency other than the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling, currency fluctuations related to these entities are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

The $16.8 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2019, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.3% against the Euro and weakened 1.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in losses of $9.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.9% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.

The $7.6 million currency loss recognized in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, offset by the U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. During fiscal 2018, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 4.7% against the Euro and 6.0% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in losses of $10.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar strengthened 3.0% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in a gain of $15.1 million. The remaining net currency loss of $11.0 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.


Income Tax Provision

Income tax expense for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019 was $34.7 million compared to income tax expense of $129.2 million for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, representing a net decrease of $94.5 million.  Contributing to the decrease in income tax expense was an income tax benefit of $118.0 million associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets as a result of the October 2019 enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures.  In connection with these transitional measures included in Switzerland tax reform, a reduced income tax rate will be utilized on certain Switzerland taxable income for up to five years.

In February 2020, the Company initiated a transaction between wholly-owned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States, the primary location of research, development, and executive management.  The migration, which includes a multi-year intercompany license of intellectual property, is expected to result in a favorable shift of income mix by jurisdiction and a reduction in expense related to uncertain tax positions.  During the term of the license agreement, this transaction is expected to decrease the Company’s effective income tax rate as compared to the fiscal year 2019 effective income tax rate excluding the $118.0 million income tax benefit associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets, as described above. The Company plans to pursue an Advance Pricing Agreement between relevant jurisdictions related to this transaction. At the end of the license agreement, a higher percentage of income will be recognized in the United States.

Net Income

As a result of the various factors noted above, income before taxes increased 20% to $987.2 million from $823.2 million in the prior year, while net income increased 37% to $952.5 million from $694.1 million in the prior year.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 28, 2019, we had approximately $2.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.  We primarily use cash flow from operations, and expect that future cash requirements may be used, to fund our capital expenditures, support our working capital requirements, pay dividends, and fund strategic acquisitions. We believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our short- and long-term projected working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements.

It is management’s goal to invest the on-hand cash in accordance with the investment policy, which has been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The investment policy’s primary purpose is to preserve capital, maintain an acceptable degree of liquidity, and maximize yield within the constraint of low credit risk.  Garmin’s average interest income returns on cash and investments during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017 were approximately 2.0%, 1.9%, and 1.6%, respectively. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding marketable securities.

The $221.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of cash provided by working capital of $303.1 million (which included a decrease of $130.7 million in net collections of accounts receivable associated primarily with strong fourth quarter sales, a net increase of $112.4 million in cash paid for inventory associated primarily with the Company’s strategy to increase days of supply to support our increasingly diversified product lines, and a net increase of $60.0 million in cash used in other activities primarily driven by payments associated with an amendment to a license agreement) and income taxes payable of $69.4 million.  The decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income of $258.4 million, reduced by other non-cash adjustments to net income of $106.9 million, which included an income tax benefit of $118.0 million associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets.

The $129.9 million increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to an increase in dividend payments of $121.1 million associated with the timing of dividend payments that resulted in one more dividend payment in 2019 compared to 2018.

Our declared dividend has increased from $0.51 per share for the twelve calendar quarters beginning in June 2016 to $0.57 per share for the four calendar quarters beginning June 2019.

The Company is party to certain other commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, capital expenditures, advertising, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business. The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 28, 2019 was approximately $586.3 million.  We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  Our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled within short periods of time.

We may be required to make significant cash outlays related to unrecognized tax benefits.  However, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities.  Accordingly, unrecognized tax benefits of $101.3 million as of December 28, 2019, have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above.  For further information related to unrecognized tax benefits, see Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Income Taxes and Note 6 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.


Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Sensitivity

We have market risk primarily in connection with the pricing of our products and services and the purchase of raw materials. Product pricing and raw materials costs are both significantly influenced by semiconductor market conditions. Historically, during cyclical industry downturns, we have been able to offset pricing declines for our products through a combination of improved product mix and success in obtaining price reductions in raw materials costs.

Inflation

We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The operation of Garmin’s subsidiaries in international markets results in exposure to movements in currency exchange rates. We have experienced significant foreign currency gains and losses due to the strengthening and weakening of the U.S. dollar. The potential of volatile foreign exchange rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant effect on our results of operations. The Company has not historically used financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exchange rate risks.

The currencies that create a majority of the Company’s exchange rate exposure are the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling. Garmin Corporation, headquartered in Taiwan, uses the local currency as the functional currency. The Company translates all assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense activity at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date. In order to minimize the effect of the currency exchange fluctuations on our net assets, we have elected to retain most of our Taiwan subsidiary’s cash and investments in accounts denominated in U.S. Dollars.

Most European subsidiaries use the Euro as the functional currency. However, the functional currency of our largest European subsidiary, Garmin (Europe) Ltd., is the U.S. Dollar, and as some transactions have occurred and balances reside in British Pounds Sterling or Euros, foreign currency gains or losses have been realized historically related to the movements of those currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Gains and losses may become more material in the future as our European presence grows.

During fiscal year 2019, the Company incurred a net foreign currency loss of $16.8 million.  The U.S. Dollar strengthening against the Euro and weakening against the Taiwan Dollar was partially offset by the U.S. Dollar weakening against the British Pound Sterling. During fiscal 2019, the U.S. Dollar strengthened 2.3% against the Euro and weakened 1.5% against the Taiwan Dollar, resulting in losses of $9.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively, while the U.S. Dollar weakened 2.9% against the British Pound Sterling, resulting in a gain of $2.8 million. The remaining net currency loss of $3.2 million was related to the timing of transactions and impacts of other currencies, each of which was individually immaterial.  These and other currency moves during fiscal year 2019 also resulted in a currency translation adjustment of $8.0 million within Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We assessed the Company’s exposure to movements in currency exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis of adverse changes in exchange rates and the corresponding impact to our results of operations. Based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than respective functional currencies as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, hypothetical and reasonably possible adverse changes of 10% for the Taiwan Dollar, Euro, and British Pound Sterling would have resulted in an adverse impact on Income before income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income of approximately $90 and $109 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.


Interest Rate Risk

We have no outstanding long-term debt as of December 29, 2018.  We, therefore, have no meaningful debt-related interest rate risk.

We are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our investments in marketable securities.  As interest rates change, the unrealized gains and losses associated with those securities will fluctuate accordingly.

The Company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company does not intend to sell securities in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such investments before recovery of their amortized costs bases, which may be maturity. During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.

We assessed the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk by performing a sensitivity analysis of a parallel shift in the yield curve and the corresponding impact to the Company’s portfolio of marketable securities.  Based on balance sheet positions as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the hypothetical and reasonably possible 100 basis point increases in interest rates across all securities would have resulted in declines in portfolio fair market value of approximately $35 million and $38 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.  Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.


Valuation of Goodwill

Description of the Matter

The Company assigns goodwill acquired in business combinations to its reporting units as of each acquisition date. At December 28, 2019, the Company’s goodwill balance related to the auto personal navigation device (“auto PND”) reporting unit was approximately $80 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.

The auto PND market has declined in recent years as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred. This has resulted in periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company’s auto PND reporting unit. Considering these qualitative factors, management performed a step one quantitative impairment test of the auto PND reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Considering the uncertainty of future operating results and/or market conditions deteriorating faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in management’s estimation of fair value, the Company disclosed some or all of the approximately $80 million of goodwill associated with the auto PND reporting unit is at risk of future impairment.

Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment test for the auto PND reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as the discount rate, projected future revenues, projected future operating margins, and terminal growth rates which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s auto PND goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the significant assumptions (e.g., discount rate, projected revenue growth rates, projected operating margins, terminal growth rates) used to develop the prospective financial information (PFI) for the quantitative analysis. We also tested management's controls to validate that the data used in the valuation was complete and accurate.

To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s auto PND reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodology and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We included valuation specialists on our team to review the Company’s model, method, and the more sensitive assumptions such as the discount rate and terminal growth assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, forecasts used in the Company’s annual operating plans and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s forecast estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the auto PND reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We reconciled the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, testing the Company’s determination of the assets and liabilities used within the reporting unit that are the basis for the carrying amount. In addition, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company.

Measurement of Reserve for Unrecognized Income Tax Benefits

Description of the Matter

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic, Income Taxes.  The Company operates in a multinational tax environment and is subject to tax laws, regulations and guidelines for intercompany transactions that have transfer pricing subjectivity. For those uncertain tax positions that qualify for recognition, the Company uses significant judgment to measure the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s balance of gross unrecognized income tax benefits was $101 million at December 28, 2019, primarily related to transfer pricing positions.


Auditing management’s measurement of these material tax positions is complex and involved especially subjective and complex judgements. The assessment process involves both significant judgment and estimation because the pricing of the intercompany transactions is based on pricing analyses that may produce a number of different outcomes or ranges of outcomes (e.g., the price that would be charged in an arm’s-length transaction). Each transfer pricing tax position carries unique facts and circumstances that must be evaluated, and ultimate resolution will be dependent on uncontrollable factors, such as the interpretation of laws and regulations; new case law; the willingness of the income tax authority to settle the issue, including the timing thereof; and other factors.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the measurement and valuation of the uncertain tax position reserves related to transfer pricing from intercompany transactions. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of inputs and calculations of these uncertain tax positions, which included management’s evaluation of the ranges of outcomes and pricing conclusions reached within the transfer pricing studies.

Our audit procedures included, among others, involving our tax professionals to test the Company’s measurement of tax positions related to transfer pricing used in intercompany transactions to assess the appropriateness of the ranges of outcomes utilized and the pricing conclusions reached within the transfer pricing studies conducted by the Company. For example, we compared the transfer pricing methodology utilized by management to alternative methodologies and industry benchmarks. We also verified our understanding of the relevant facts by reading the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and any third-party advice obtained by the Company. In addition, we used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity from income tax authorities, to evaluate the appropriateness of the Company’s measurement of uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing used in these intercompany transactions.

GARMIN LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands, except share and per share information)

December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018

1. Description of the Business

Garmin Ltd. and subsidiaries (together, the “Company”) design, develop, manufacture, market, and distribute a diverse family of hand-held, wrist-based, portable, and fixed-mount Global Positioning System (GPS)-enabled products and other navigation, communications, information and sensor-based products. Garmin Corporation (GC) is primarily responsible for the manufacturing and distribution of the Company’s products to the Company’s subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, new product development and sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Asia and the Far East. Garmin International, Inc. (GII) is primarily responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in the Americas region and for most of the Company’s research and new product development. GII also manufactures most of the Company’s products in the aviation segment. Garmin (Europe) Ltd. (GEL) is responsible for sales and marketing of the Company’s products in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Many of GEL’s sales are to other Company-owned distributors in the EMEA region.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the accounts of Garmin Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.

As previously announced and discussed below within the “Recently Adopted Accounting Standards” section of this footnote, effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), using the full retrospective method. All amounts and disclosures set forth in this Form 10-K reflect these changes.  Further, as a result of the adoption of certain other accounting standards described below, effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year, certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Fiscal Year

The Company’s fiscal year is based on a 52-53-week period ending on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Due to the fact that there are not exactly 52 weeks in a calendar year, and there is slightly more than one additional day per year (not including the effects of leap year) in each calendar year as compared to a 52-week fiscal year, the Company will have a fiscal year comprising 53 weeks in certain fiscal years, as determined by when the last Saturday of the calendar year occurs.

In those resulting fiscal years that have 53 weeks, the Company will record an extra week of sales, costs, and related financial activity. Therefore, the financial results of those 53-week fiscal years, and the associated 14-week fourth quarters, will not be entirely comparable to the prior and subsequent 52-week fiscal years and the associated 13-week quarters. Fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 each included 52 weeks.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Foreign Currency

Many Garmin Ltd. subsidiaries utilize currencies other than the United States Dollar (USD) as their functional currency. As required by the Foreign Currency Matters topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the financial statements of these subsidiaries for all periods presented have been translated into USD, the functional currency of Garmin Ltd., and the reporting currency herein, for purposes of consolidation at rates prevailing during the year for sales, costs, and expenses and at end-of-year rates for all assets and liabilities.  The effect of this translation is recorded in a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Cumulative currency translation adjustments of $

55,289

and $

47,327

as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively, have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date.  Assets and liabilities resulting from these transactions are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.  The majority of the Company’s consolidated foreign currency gain or loss is typically driven by the significant cash and marketable securities, receivables, and payables held in a currency other than the functional currency at a given legal entity. Net foreign currency losses recorded in results of operations were $

16,799

, $

7,616

, and $

22,579

, for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.  The loss in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the USD strengthening against the Euro and weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, which was partially offset by the USD weakening against the British Pound Sterling. The loss in fiscal 2018 was due primarily to the USD strengthening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling, offset by the USD strengthening against the Taiwan Dollar. The loss in fiscal 2017 was due primarily to the USD weakening against the Taiwan Dollar, which was partially offset by the USD weakening against the Euro and British Pound Sterling.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share amounts are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  For purposes of diluted earnings per share, the number of shares that would be issued from the exercise of dilutive share-based compensation awards has been reduced by the number of shares which could have been purchased from the proceeds of the exercise or release at the average market price of the Company’s stock during the period the awards were outstanding.  See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, operating accounts, money market funds, deposits readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and securities with maturities of three months or less when purchased.  The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value, given the short maturity of those instruments. Restricted cash is reported separately from cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restricted cash.

The total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet reconciles to the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Trade Accounts Receivable

The Company sells its products to retailers, wholesalers, and other customers and extends credit based on its evaluation of the customer’s financial condition.  Potential losses on receivables are dependent on each individual customer’s financial condition.  The Company carries its trade accounts receivable at net realizable value.  Typically, its accounts receivable are collected within 80 days and do not bear interest.  The Company monitors its exposure to losses on receivables and maintains allowances for potential losses or adjustments.  The Company determines these allowances by (1) evaluating the aging of its receivables and (2) reviewing its high-risk customers.  Past due receivable balances are written off when internal collection efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due.  The Company maintains trade credit insurance to provide security against large losses.


Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company grants credit to certain customers who meet the Company’s pre-established credit requirements.  Generally, the Company does not require security when trade credit is granted to customers.  Credit losses are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and typically have been within management’s expectations.  Certain customers are allowed extended terms consistent with normal industry practice.  Most of these extended terms can be classified as either relating to seasonal sales variations or to the timing of new product releases by the Company.

The Company’s top ten customers have contributed between


% and


% of net sales annually since 2017.

None

of the Company’s customers accounted for more than or equal to 10% of consolidated net sales in the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  The Company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.  Inventories consisted of the following:

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and typically depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

As required by the

Property, Plant and Equipment

topic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 360), the Company reviews property and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  That assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability.  An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. The Company did not recognize any material long-lived asset impairment charges in the fiscal years of 2019, 2018, or 2017.


Intangible Assets

At December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, the Company had patents, customer related intangibles and other identifiable finite-lived intangible assets recorded at a cost of $

432,296

and $

330,532

, respectively.  Identifiable, finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis typically over

three

to

ten

years

.  Accumulated amortization was $

239,776

and $

214,469

at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $

26,225

, $

21,796

, and $

20,863

for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.  In the next five years, the amortization expense is estimated to be $

25,654

, $

22,000

, $

19,290

, $

18,127

, and $

16,880

, respectively. The Company also reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360, as described above, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable.

The Company’s excess purchase cost over fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) was $

467,108

at December 28, 2019, and $

301,017

at December 29, 2018.

The

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

topic of the FASB ASC (ASC Topic 350) requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be assessed for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Company performs its annual impairment assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, if any, in the fourth quarter of each year, as of the Company’s fiscal year end date. ASC Topic 350 allows management to first perform a qualitative assessment by assessing the qualitative factors of relevant events and circumstances at the reporting unit level to determine if it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative test will be performed. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then a goodwill impairment charge will be recognized in the amount by which carrying amount exceeds fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  See the Recently Adopted Accounting Standards section below regarding the Company’s early adoption of ASU 2017-04.

Each of the Company’s operating segments (auto PND, auto OEM, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor) represents a distinct reporting unit.  The auto PND market has declined in recent years as competing technologies have emerged and market saturation has occurred. This has resulted in periods of lower revenues and profits for the Company’s auto PND reporting unit. Considering these qualitative factors, management performed a  quantitative impairment test of the auto PND reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019 and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying amount.  However, considering the uncertainty of future operating results and/or market conditions deteriorating faster or more drastically than the forecasts utilized in management’s estimation of fair value, management believes some or all of the approximately $


million of goodwill associated with the Company’s auto PND reporting unit is at risk of future impairment.

Management also performed a quantitative impairment test of the Auto OEM reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019 and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.  As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $


million, which was the total goodwill balance associated with the auto OEM reporting unit.  The impairment charge was not material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Management concluded that no other reporting units are currently at risk of impairment, and the Company did not recognize any material goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal years 2019, 2018, or 2017.


Leases

The Company leases certain real estate properties, vehicles, and equipment in various countries around the world. Leased properties are typically used for office space, distribution, and retail. The Company’s leases are classified as operating leases with remaining terms of


to


years

, some of which include an option to extend or renew. If the exercise of an option to extend or renew is determined to be reasonably certain, the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability reflects the extended period and payments For newly signed leases, the right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognized on lease commencement date. Variable lease costs, such as adjustments to payments based on consumer price indices, are excluded in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. For all real estate leases, any non-lease components, including common area maintenance, have been separated from lease components and excluded from the associated right-of-use asset and lease liability calculations. For all equipment and vehicle leases, an accounting policy election has been made to not separate lease and non-lease components.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (“short-term leases”) are not recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as a right-of-use asset or lease liability.

Dividends

Under Swiss corporate law, dividends must be approved by shareholders at the general meeting of the Company’s shareholders.

On June 7, 2019, the shareholders approved a dividend of $

2.28

per share (of which, $

1.14

was paid in the Company’s 2019 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:

The Company paid dividends in 2019 in the amount of $

417,264

, which included four dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On June 8, 2018, the shareholders approved a dividend of $

2.12

per share (of which, $

1.06

was paid in the Company’s 2018 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:

The Company paid dividends in 2018 in the amount of $

296,148

, which included three dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

On June 9, 2017, the shareholders approved a dividend of $

2.04

per share (of which, $

1.53

was paid in the Company’s 2017 fiscal year) payable in four equal installments on dates determined by the Board of Directors. The dates determined by the Board were as follows:


The Company paid dividends in 2017 in the amount of $

382,976

, which included four dividend distributions in the fiscal year. Both the dividends paid and the remaining dividend payable were reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

Approximately $

61,129

of retained earnings was indefinitely restricted from distribution to stockholders pursuant to the laws of Taiwan as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.

Marketable Securities

Management determines the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.

All of the Company’s marketable securities were considered available-for-sale at December 28, 2019. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At December 28, 2019, cumulative unrealized gains of $


were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes. At December 29, 2018, cumulative unrealized net losses of $

38,897

were reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.

Investments are reviewed periodically to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other-than-temporary.  The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities within Other income (expense) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and the noncredit component within Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Testing for impairment of investments requires significant management judgment. The identification of potentially impaired investments, the determination of their fair value, and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements. The discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments. Revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known, and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time.  The economic environment and volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security.  Such amortization and realized gains/losses are recorded within Interest income and Other income (expense), respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

Investments are discussed in detail in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

. The liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes as measured based on the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.  The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.


The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the FASB ASC 740 topic

Income Taxes

.  The Company recognizes liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.  If payment of these amounts ultimately proves not to be required, the reversal of the liabilities result

s

in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.  If the Company’s estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.

Income taxes are discussed in detail in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer in an amount that depicts the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to for the related products or services.   For the large majority of the Company’s sales, transfer of control occurs once product has shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. The Company offers certain tangible products with ongoing services promised over a period of time, typically the useful life of the related tangible product. When such services have been identified as both capable of being distinct and separately identifiable from the related tangible product, the associated revenue allocated to such services is recognized over time.  The Company generally does not offer specified or unspecified upgrade rights to its customers in connection with software sales.

The Company allocates revenue to all performance obligations associated with tangible products containing separately identifiable ongoing services based on the respective performance obligations’ relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”), with the amounts allocated to ongoing services deferred and recognized over a period of time.  These ongoing services primarily consist of the Company’s contractual promises to provide personal navigation device (PND) users with map updates and server-based traffic services. In addition, we provide map update services (map care) over a contractual period in certain hardware and software contracts with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The Company has determined that directly observable prices do not exist for map updates, map care, or server-based traffic, as stand-alone and unbundled unit sales do not occur on more than a limited basis. Therefore, the Company uses the expected cost plus a margin as the primary indicator to calculate relative SSP of map updates, map care, and traffic performance obligations. The revenue and associated costs allocated to map updates, map care, and/or the server-based traffic service are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated life of the products of approximately


years for PNDs, or the estimated map care period in OEM contracts of


-


years

as we believe our efforts related to providing these services are spread evenly throughout the performance period. In addition to the products listed above, the Company has offered certain other products with ongoing performance obligations including mobile applications, incremental navigation and communication service subscriptions, aviation database subscriptions, and extended warranties that are recognized over the contractual service period (typically


-


years

).

The Company records revenue net of sales tax and variable consideration such as trade discounts and customer returns.  Payment is due typically within


days or less of shipment of product, or upon the grant of a given software license (as applicable). The Company records estimated reductions to revenue in the form of variable consideration for customer sales programs, returns, and incentive offerings including rebates, price protection (product discounts offered to retailers to assist in clearing older products from their inventories in advance of new product releases), promotions, and other volume-based incentives.  Cooperative advertising incentives payable to dealers and distributors are recorded as reductions of revenue unless we obtain proof of a distinct advertising service, in which case we record the incentive as advertising expense.  The reductions to revenue are based on estimates and judgments using historical experience and expectation of future conditions.  Changes in these estimates could negatively affect the Company’s operating results.  These incentives are reviewed periodically and, with the exceptions of price protection and certain other promotions, typically accrued for on a percentage of sales basis.

Deferred Revenues and Costs

At December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the Company had deferred revenues totaling $

161,891

and $

172,938

, respectively, and related deferred costs totaling $

48,598

and $

57,935

, respectively.


Deferred revenue consists primarily of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are recognized over a period of time basis as discussed in the

Revenue Recognition

portion of this footnote. Billings associated with such items are typically completed upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer

and recorded to accounts receivable until payment is received. Deferred costs primarily refer to the royalties incurred by the Company associated with the aforementioned unsatisfied performance obligations, which are amortized over the same period as the revenue is recognized. The Company typically pays the associated royalties either monthly or quarterly in arrears, on a per item shipped or installed basis.

The Company applies a practical expedient, as permitted within ASC 340, to expense as incurred the incremental costs to obtain a contract when the amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling activities are typically performed before the customer obtains control of the good, and the related costs are therefore expensed as incurred. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Product Warranty

The Company accrues for estimated future warranty costs at the time products are sold.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to retail partners generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable, is damaged, or is defective.  The Company’s historical experience is that these types of warranty obligations are generally fulfilled within 5 months from time of sale.  The Company’s standard warranty obligation to its end-users provides for a period of

one

to

two

years

from date of shipment while certain aviation, marine, and auto OEM products have a warranty period of

two years

or more from the date of installation.

The Company’s estimates of costs to service its warranty obligations are based on historical experience and management’s expectations and judgments of future conditions.  To the extent the Company experiences increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, its warranty accrual will increase, which may result in decreased gross profit.

The following reconciliation provides an illustration of changes in the aggregate warranty accrual:

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense amounted to approximately $

164,456

, $

155,394

, and $

164,693

for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.

Research and Development

A majority of the Company’s research and development is performed in the United States. Research and development costs, which are typically expensed as incurred, amounted to approximately $

605,366

, $

567,805

, and $

511,634

for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.


Preproduction Costs Related to Long-Term Supply Arrangements

Preproduction design and development costs related to long-term supply arrangements are expensed as incurred, and classified as Research and development, unless the customer has provided a contractual guarantee for reimbursement of such costs. Contractually reimbursable costs are capitalized as incurred in the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid expenses and other current assets if reimbursement is expected to be received within one year, or within Other assets if expected to be received beyond one year. Such capitalized costs were approximately $

24,267

as of December 28, 2019, and there were

no

such capitalized costs as of December 29, 2018.

Customer Service and Technical Support

Customer service and technical support costs are included as selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Customer service and technical support costs include costs associated with performing order processing, answering customer inquiries by telephone and through websites, e-mail and other electronic means, and providing free technical support assistance to customers. The technical support is typically provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized. The related cost of providing this free support is not material.

Software Development Costs

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Software

requires companies to expense software development costs as they incur them until technological feasibility has been established, at which time those costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers.  The Company’s capitalized software development costs are not significant, as the time elapsed from working model to release is typically short.  As required by the Research and Development topic of the FASB ASC, costs incurred to enhance our existing products or after the general release of the service using the product are expensed in the period they are incurred and included in research and development costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The Company currently sponsors four stock-based employee compensation plans. The FASB ASC topic entitled Compensation – Stock Compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expenses for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options and restricted stock, based on estimated fair values.

Accounting guidance requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As stock-based compensation expenses recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income are based on awards ultimately expected to vest, they have been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Accounting guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience and management’s estimates.

Excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation are recognized in the income tax provision and are not estimated in the effective tax rate, rather, are recorded as discrete tax items in the period they occur. Excess income tax benefits from stock-based compensation arrangements are classified as a cash flow from operations.

Stock compensation plans are discussed in detail in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.


Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The FASB subsequently issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-10 and Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-11 in July 2018, which provide clarifications and improvements to ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new lease standard”). Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-11 also provides the optional transition method which allows companies to apply the new lease standard at the adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented. The new lease standard requires lessees to present a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet.

The Company adopted the new lease standard as of the beginning of the 2019 fiscal year using the optional transition method. The Company did not have a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as a result of adopting the new lease standard and does not expect the new lease standard to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in future periods. The Company elected the package of transitional practical expedients upon adoption which, among other provisions, allowed the Company to carry forward historical lease classification. See Note 14 – Leases for additional information regarding leases.

Intangible – Goodwill and Other

In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04, Intangible – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplify the Test for Goodwill Impairment (“ASU 2017-04”) which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment. ASU 2017-04 removes “step two” of the goodwill impairment test, such that a goodwill impairment charge will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. ASU 2017-04 should be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, or any goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04 in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 28, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. The FASB issued several updates amending or relating to ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the “new revenue standard”).  The Company adopted the new revenue standard in the 2018 fiscal year using the full retrospective method, which requires the Company to restate each prior reporting period presented in future financial statement issuances. The impacts of adopting the new revenue standard relate to our accounting for certain arrangements within the auto segment.

A portion of the Company’s auto segment contracts had historically been accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 985-605 Software-Revenue Recognition (Topic 985-605). Under Topic 985-605, the Company deferred revenue and associated costs of all elements of multiple-element software arrangements if vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE) could not be established for an undelivered element (e.g. map updates). In applying the new revenue standard to certain contracts that include both software licenses and map updates, we now recognize the portion of revenue and costs related to the software license at the time of delivery rather than ratably over the map update period.

Additionally, for certain multiple-element arrangements within the Company’s auto segment, the Company’s policy had been to allocate consideration to traffic services and recognize the revenue and associated cost of royalties ratably over the estimated life of the underlying product. Under the new revenue standard, we recognize revenue and associated costs of royalties related to certain broadcast traffic services at the time of hardware and/or software delivery. Specifically, the new revenue standard emphasizes the timing of the Company’s performance, and upon delivery of the navigation device and/or software, the Company has fully performed its obligation with respect to the design and production of the product to receive and interpret the broadcast traffic signal for the benefit of the end user.


The changes in accounting policy described above collectively result in reductions to deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) balances, and accelerate the recognition of revenue and deferred costs in the auto segment going forward.

Summarized financial information depicting the impact of the new revenue standard is presented below.

The Company’s historical net cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing, and financing activities were not impacted by adoption of the new revenue standard.

(1)

The Restated results above were presented in our fiscal year 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019, in connection with the Company’s adoption of ASC Topic 606 in fiscal year 2018 using the full retrospective method.

Financial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (“ASU 2016-01”). The standard addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company has adopted the new standard effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.


Statement of Cash Flows

In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (“ASU 2016-15”), which adds or clarifies guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice. In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (“ASU 2016-18”), which requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling changes in the total amounts within the statement of cash flows. The Company has adopted the new standards effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact to the Company’s statements of cash flows. The amendments of ASU 2016-18 were applied using a retrospective transition method, resulting in immaterial changes to the presentation of the Company’s statements of cash flows.

Income Taxes

In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other than Inventory (“ASU 2016-16”), which requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The Company has adopted the new standard effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year, which resulted in a reclassification of approximately $

1,700

of certain prepaid tax balances in a cumulative effect to retained earnings as of the date of adoption.

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income

In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“ASU 2018-02”), which allows for stranded tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to be reclassified to retained earnings. The Company has elected to early adopt the new standard effective beginning in the 2018 fiscal year, resulting in reclassification of approximately $


from accumulated other comprehensive income into retained earnings. The tax effects that were reclassified only relate to amounts resulting from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

3. Marketable Securities

The FASB ASC topic entitled

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).  The accounting guidance classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:

The Company endeavors to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation is based on prices obtained from an independent pricing vendor using both market and income approaches. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, and credit spreads.


The method described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Available-for-sale securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:

Marketable securities classified as available-for-sale securities are summarized below:


The Company’s investment policy targets low risk investments with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The fair value of our securities varies from period to period due to changes in interest rates, in the performance of the underlying collateral and in the credit performance of the underlying issuer, among other factors. The Company does not intend to sell the securities that have an unrealized loss shown in the table above, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.

The Company recognizes the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments of debt securities within Other income (expense) on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and the noncredit component within Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  During 2019 and 2018, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its outstanding securities.

The amortized cost and fair value of the securities at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2019 were $

611,732

and $

604,509

respectively. Approximately


% of securities in our portfolio were at an unrealized loss position at December 28, 2019.  We have the ability to hold these securities until maturity or their value is recovered. We do not consider these unrealized losses to be other than temporary credit losses because there has been no material deterioration in credit quality and no change in the cash flows of the underlying securities. We do not intend to sell the securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities; therefore, no material impairment has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated statement of income.

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

The following tables display additional information regarding gross unrealized losses and fair value by major security type for available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.


The amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at December 28, 2019, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

4. Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

The Company is party to certain commitments, which include purchases of raw materials, capital expenditures, advertising, and other indirect purchases in connection with conducting our business.  The aggregate amount of purchase orders and other commitments open as of December 28, 2019 was approximately $

586,300

. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.  Our purchase orders are generally based on our current needs and typically fulfilled by our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time.

Certain cash balances are held as collateral in relation to bank guarantees.  The total amount of restricted cash was $


and $


on December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively.

Contingencies

In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal claims, investigations and complaints, including matters alleging patent infringement and other intellectual property claims. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly and annual basis, developments in legal proceedings, investigations, claims, and other loss contingencies that could affect any required accrual or disclosure or estimate of reasonably possible loss or range of loss.  An estimated loss from a loss contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  If a range of loss is estimated, and some amount within that range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within that range, then that amount is accrued.  If no amount within the range can be identified as a better estimate than any other amount, the Company accrues the minimum amount in the range.


If an outcome unfavorable to the Company is determined to be probable, but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated or is determined to be reasonably possible, but not probable, we disclose the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.  The Company’s aggregate range of reasonably possible losses includes (1) matters where a liability has been accrued and there is a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued for that liability, and (2) matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible, but not probable, and a liability therefore has not been accrued.  This aggregate range only represents the Company’s estimate of reasonably possible losses and does not represent the Company’s maximum loss exposure.  The assessment regarding whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events.  In assessing the probability of an outcome in a lawsuit, claim or assessment that could be unfavorable to the Company, we consider the following factors, among others: a) the nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment; b) the progress of the case; c) the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers; d) our experience in similar cases; e) the experience of other entities in similar cases; and f) how we intend to respond to the lawsuit, claim, or assessment.  Costs incurred in defending lawsuits, claims or assessments are expensed as incurred.

Management of the Company currently does not believe it is reasonably possible that the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of recorded accruals, with respect to loss contingencies in the aggregate, for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019. The results of legal proceedings, investigations and claims, however, cannot be predicted with certainty. An adverse resolution of one or more of such matters in excess of management’s expectations could have a material adverse effect in the particular quarter or fiscal year in which a loss is recorded, but based on information currently known, the Company does not believe it is likely that losses from such matters would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company settled or resolved certain legal matters during the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s business or its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

5. Employee Benefit Plans

GII and the Company’s other U.S.-based subsidiaries sponsor a defined contribution employee retirement plan under which their employees may contribute up to


% of their annual compensation subject to Internal Revenue Code maximum limitations and to which the subsidiaries contribute a specified percentage of each participant’s annual compensation up to certain limits as defined in the retirement plan. During the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, expense related to this and other defined contribution plans of $

55,456

, $

52,232

, and $

43,826

, respectively, was recorded within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Certain of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries sponsor or participate in local defined benefit pension plans for which contributions are calculated by formulas that consider final pensionable salaries. The obligations, contributions, and associated expense of such plans for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017 were not material.


6. Income Taxes

The Company’s income tax provision (benefit) consists of the following:

The income tax provision differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to income before taxes.

The sources and tax effects of the differences, including the impact of establishing tax contingency accruals, are as follows:

The Company recorded income tax expense of $

34,736

in the year ended December 28, 2019, which included an income tax benefit of $

117,989

related to the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets as a result of the October 2019 enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $

11,936

in the year ended December 30, 2017, which included an income tax benefit of $

180,034

primarily related to the revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets resulting from the Company’s election in the first quarter of 2017 to align certain Switzerland corporate tax positions with international tax initiatives.


The Company’s statutory federal income tax rate in Switzerland, the Company's place of incorporation since the Redomestication, is

7.83

%. If the Company reconciled taxes at the Swiss holding company federal statutory tax rate to the reported income tax expense for 2019 as presented above, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $

130,000

lower, or $

77,000

, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $

73,000

.  For 2018, the amounts related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $

108,000

lower, or $

65,000

, and the foreign tax rate differential would be adjusted by a similar amount to approximately $

65,000

.  For 2017, the amount related to tax at the statutory rate would be approximately $

186,000

lower, or $

53,600

, and the foreign tax differential would be reduced by a similar amount to approximately $

77,000

.  All other amounts would remain substantially unchanged.

The Company’s income before income taxes attributable to non-U.S. operations was $

606,711

, $

532,657

, and $

461,436

, for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.

Income taxes of $

35,982

, $

36,800

, and $

45,534

at December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively, have not been accrued by the Company for the unremitted earnings of several of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be reinvested in the subsidiaries indefinitely.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

Deferred tax assets related to intangible assets increased as of December 28, 2019 as compared to December 29, 2018 by $

102,639

primarily related to the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets as a result of the enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform and related transitional measures.


At December 28, 2019, the Company had $

11,164

of tax credit carryover compared to $

9,697

at December 29, 2018. At December 28, 2019, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $

1,981

related to the future tax benefit of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $

7,895

. Included in the NOL carryforwards is $


that relates to Finland and expires in varying amounts between


and


, $


that relates to the Netherlands and expires in


, and $

6,408

that relates to various other jurisdictions and has no expiration date.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for a portion of its deferred tax asset relating to various tax attributes that it does not believe are more likely than not to be realized.  In the future, if the Company determines, based on existence of sufficient evidence, that it should realize more or less of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowance will be made in the period such a determination is made.

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, primarily related to transfer pricing, as of December 28, 2019 was $

101,251

.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017 is as follows:

Accounting guidance requires unrecognized tax benefits to be classified as noncurrent liabilities, except for the portion that is expected to be paid within one year of the balance sheet date.  The balance of net unrecognized benefits of $

92,056

, $

114,682

, and $

127,306

are required to be classified as noncurrent at December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively.  The balance of net unrecognized tax benefits of $

5,816

is classified as a current liability at December 28, 2019.

None

of the unrecognized tax benefits were classified as current liabilities for the years ending December 29, 2018 or December 30, 2017. The net unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would reduce the effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized tax benefits are due to uncertainty in the timing of deductibility.

Interest and penalties, if any, accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in income tax expense.  At December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, the Company had accrued approximately $

7,636

, $

6,613

, and $

5,605

, respectively, for interest.  The interest component of the reserve increased income tax expense for the years ending December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, by $

1,023

, $

1,008

, and $

1,704

, respectively.  The Company did

no

t have material amounts accrued for penalties for the years ending December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017.

The Company files income tax returns in Switzerland, U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various states, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In its major tax jurisdictions, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom, and U.S. federal and various states, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities, with few exceptions, for years prior to 2015, 2014, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

The Company recognized a reduction of income tax expense of $

26,158

, $

27,106

, and $

17,918

in fiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017, respectively, to reflect the expiration of statutes of limitations and releases due to audit settlement in various jurisdictions.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $

25,000

to $

40,000

of its reserves for certain unrecognized tax benefits will decrease within the next 12 months as the result of the expiration of statutes of limitations.  This potential decrease in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate within the next 12 months.


7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As required by the

Financial Instruments

topic of the FASB ASC, the following summarizes required information about the fair value of certain financial instruments for which it is currently practicable to estimate such value. None of the financial instruments are held or issued for trading purposes.

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

For certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including accounts receivable, loan receivable, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.

8. Segment Information

The Company has identified

five

reportable segments – auto, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor.  There are two operating segments (auto PND and auto OEM) that are not reported separately but aggregated within the auto reportable segment.  Each operating segment is individually reviewed and evaluated by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who allocates resources and assesses performance of each segment individually.

The products of the Company’s reportable segments are sold through the Company’s network of independent dealers and distributors as well as through OEMs.  However, the nature of products and types of customers for the

five

reportable segments vary. All of the Company’s segments include portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers and accessories sold to retail outlets. These products are produced primarily by the Company’s subsidiary in Taiwan.  The Company’s aviation products include portable and panel mount avionics for Visual Flight Rules and Instrument Flight Rules navigation and are sold primarily to aviation dealers and certain aircraft manufacturers.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the CODM, uses operating income as the measure of profit or loss, combined with other measures, to assess segment performance and allocate resources. Operating income represents net sales less costs of goods sold and operating expenses. Net sales are directly attributed to each segment. Most costs of goods sold and the majority of operating expenses are also directly attributed to each segment, while certain other costs of goods sold and operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner appropriate to the specific facts and circumstances of the expenses being allocated.  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.  There are no inter-segment sales or transfers.

The Company’s reportable segments share many common resources, infrastructures and assets in the normal course of business.  Thus, the Company does not report accounts receivable, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, or capital expenditures by segment to the CODM.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the methodology used to allocate certain selling, general, and administrative expenses to the segments was refined, endeavoring to provide the Company’s CODM with a more meaningful representation of segment profit or loss in light of the evolution of its segments.  The Company’s composition of operating segments and reportable segments did not change. Prior year amounts are presented here as they were originally reported, as it is not practicable to accurately restate prior period activity in accordance with the refined allocation methodology. For comparative purposes, we estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018 would have been approximately $


million less for the aviation segment, approximately $


million more for the marine segment, approximately $


million more for the outdoor segment, and not significantly different for the auto and fitness segments. We estimate operating income for the 52-weeks ended December 30, 2017 would have been approximately $


million less for the aviation segment, approximately $


million less for the fitness segment, approximately $


million more for the marine segment, and approximately $


million more for each of the outdoor and auto segments.


Net sales (“revenue”), gross profit, and operating income for each of the Company’s reportable segments are presented below.

Net sales, property and equipment, and net assets by geographic area are as shown below for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017.  Note that APAC includes Asia Pacific and Australian Continent, and EMEA includes Europe, the Middle East and Africa.


9. Stock Compensation Plans

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

The various Company stock compensation plans are summarized below.  For all stock compensation plans, the Company’s policy is to issue treasury shares for option/stock appreciation right (SAR) exercises, restricted stock unit (RSU) releases and employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) purchases.

2011 Non-employee Directors’ Equity Incentive Plan

In June 2011, the stockholders adopted an equity incentive plan for non-employee directors (the “2011 Directors Plan”) providing for grants of stock options, SARs, RSUs and/or performance shares, pursuant to which up to

122,592

shares were available for issuance. The term of each award cannot exceed

ten years

. Awards are subject to a minimum

one-year

vesting period. In 2019, 2018, and 2017,

8,016

,

10,376

, and

10,432

RSUs were granted under this plan.

2005 Equity Incentive Plan

10,000,000

common shares were available for issuance. In 2013, the shareholders approved an additional

3,000,000

shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan

13,000,000

.  Option and SAR grants vest evenly over a period of

five years

or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire

ten years

from the date of grant, if not exercised.

RSUs granted prior to December 10, 2012 vested evenly over a period of five years

, while RSUs granted on and after that date vested or are vesting evenly over a period of

three years

.  In addition to time-based vesting requirements, the vesting of certain RSU grants is also contingent upon the Company’s achievement of certain financial performance goals.  During 2019, 2018, and 2017,

786,346

,

1,040,001

, and

1,044,045

RSUs were granted under the 2005 Plan.

7,000,000

common shares were available for issuance. The stock options and SARs vest evenly over a period of

five years

or as otherwise determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee and generally expire

ten years

from the date of grant, if not exercised.  The Company did

no

t grant any stock awards from the 2000 Plan in 2019, 2018, or 2017.

2000 Non-employee Directors’ Option Plan

In October 2000, the stockholders adopted a stock option plan for non-employee directors (the “2000 Directors Plan”) providing for grants of options for up to

100,000

common shares. In 2009, the stockholders approved an additional

150,000

shares to the plan, making the total shares authorized under the plan

250,000

.  The term of each award is

ten years

. All awards vest evenly over a

three-year

period. Following the June 2011 approval of the 2011 Directors Plan, the Company will no longer issue options to purchase shares under this plan.

Stock-Based Compensation Activity

A summary of the Company’s stock-based compensation activity and related information under the 2011 Directors Plan, the 2005 Plan, the 2000 Plan and the 2000 Directors Plan for the years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017 is provided below:


The weighted-average remaining contract life for stock options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 28, 2019 were

4.67

years

.  The weighted-average remaining contract life of restricted stock units at December 28, 2019 was

1.19

years.


The total fair value of awards vested during 2019, 2018, and 2017, was $

52,780

, $

41,092

, and $

30,280

, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs outstanding and exercisable at December 28, 2019 were $

3,122

. The aggregate intrinsic values of options and SARs exercised during 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $


, $

4,452

, and $

3,742

, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding at December 28, 2019 was $

175,269

.  The aggregate intrinsic values of RSUs released during 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $

103,702

, $

60,361

, and $

45,424

, respectively.  Aggregate intrinsic value of options and SARs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the positive difference between the exercise price and the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.  Aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs represents the applicable number of awards multiplied by the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant fiscal period.  The Company’s closing stock price was $

98.52

on December 28, 2019 (based on the closing stock price on December 27, 2019). As of December 28, 2019, there was $

80,613

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation awards granted to employees under the stock compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The shareholders have adopted an ESPP. Up to

8,000,000

shares of common stock have been reserved for the ESPP. Shares will be offered to employees at a price equal to the lesser of


% of the fair market value of the stock on the date of purchase or


% of the fair market value on the first day of the ESPP period. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  During 2019, 2018, and 2017,

451,625

,

463,066

, and

489,267

shares, respectively, were purchased under the plan for a total purchase price of $

27,048

, $

23,709

, and $

20,996

, respectively.  During 2019, 2018, and 2017, the purchases were issued from treasury shares.  At December 28, 2019, approximately

2,055,655

shares were available for future issuance.

10. Earnings Per Share

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share:

There were

297,995

and

1,175,728

outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock units (collectively “equity awards”) excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the 2019 and 2017 fiscal years, respectively, because the effect would have been anti-dilutive. There were

no

equity awards excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the 2018 fiscal year because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.


11. Share Repurchase Plan

On February 13, 2015, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $

300,000

of its common shares through December 31, 2016.  In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized an extension through

December 31, 2017

to purchase remaining common shares.  Under the plan, the Company repurchased


shares in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, and repurchased

1,474,092

13. Revenue

In order to further depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors, we disaggregate revenue (or “net sales”) by geographic region, major product category, and pattern of recognition.

Disaggregated revenue by geographic region (Americas, APAC, and EMEA) is presented in Note 8 – Segment Information.  The Company has identified six major product categories – auto PND, and auto OEM, aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor.  Note 8 also contains disaggregated revenue information of the aviation, fitness, marine, and outdoor major product categories. Auto segment revenue presented in Note 8 is comprised of the auto PND and auto OEM major product categories as depicted below.


A large majority of the Company’s sales are recognized on a point in time basis, usually once the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer. Sales recognized over a period of time are primarily within the auto segment and relate to performance obligations that are satisfied over the life of the product or contractual service period. Revenue disaggregated by the timing of transfer of the goods or services is presented in the table below:

Transaction price and costs associated with the Company’s unsatisfied performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue and deferred costs, respectively, on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such amounts are recognized ratably over the applicable service period or estimated useful life. Changes in deferred revenue and costs during the 52-week periods ending December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, are presented below:

Of the $

179,790

of deferred revenue recognized in the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019, $

95,009

was deferred as of the beginning of the period. Of the $

170,495

of deferred revenue recognized in the 52-weeks ended December 29, 2018, $

105,924

was deferred as of the beginning of the period.

Of the $

161,891

and $

172,938

of deferred revenue at the end of the periods, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively,

approximately two-thirds is recognized ratably over a period of three years or less.


14. Leases

The following table represents lease costs recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the 52-weeks ended December 28, 2019. Lease costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expense and Research and development expense on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard, lease expense for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were $

21,096

and $

18,915

, respectively.

The following table represents the components of leases that are recognized on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2019.

The following table represents the maturity of lease liabilities.

As of December 28, 2019, the Company has entered into leases that have not yet commenced with future lease payments of $

23,966

, the majority of which relates to a manufacturing facility lease in Poland. These leases will commence in fiscal year 2020 with lease terms ranging from


to


years

.

As of December 29, 2018, prior to the Company’s adoption of Topic 842, future minimum lease payments were as follows:


The following table presents supplemental cash flow and noncash information related to leases.

15. Selected Quarterly Information (Unaudited)

The above quarterly financial data is unaudited, but in the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the selected data for these interim periods presented have been included. These results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results, and the table may not foot due to rounding.

16. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 provides new guidance on assessment of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.


Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs

In March 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-08, Receivables – Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Topic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities (“ASU 2017-08”), which shortens the amortization period for certain callable debt securities held at a premium, requiring the premium to be amortized to the earliest call date. Callable debt securities held at a discount continue to be amortized to maturity. ASU 2017-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect the new standard to have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

17. Subsequent Events

In February 2020, the Company initiated a transaction, including a multi-year intercompany license agreement, between wholly-owned subsidiaries to migrate ownership of certain intellectual property from Switzerland to the United States. The expected impact of this subsequent event was considered when determining the carrying value associated with the revaluation and step-up of certain Switzerland tax assets, which was recorded by the Company in fiscal 2019 as a result of the enactment of Switzerland federal and Schaffhausen cantonal tax reform.

Controls and Procedures

(a)

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

(b)

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework” (2013 framework).

Based on such assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019.

We acquired Tacx on April 1, 2019, and excluded it from our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019. Total assets, excluding the net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, and Net sales of Tacx represent 1.3% and 1.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 28, 2019.Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, issued an attestation report on management’s effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, as stated in their report which is included herein. That attestation report appears below.

Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Garmin Ltd. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Tacx, which was acquired on April 1, 2019 and is included in the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 1.3% of total assets, excluding net identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, as of December 28, 2019 and 1.7% of revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Tacx.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
